5,Flappywall,"When I first got this app I just wanted to improve my brain and stuff because yes but after getting the game and after trying it out, it is quite fun. I could honestly play this for a while without getting bored because they have a pretty big collection of games to play, they could vary from relaxing to intense but all of that is up to you. When you first get the app it asks you a few questions about you and what you want to improve and after that it actually helps you improve those areas that you chose. I like the fact that before every game you play it tells you what that game can help you improve and then a little tutorial on how to play the game and that‚Äôs it, you just go straight into the game with a goal.   This is my first time making a review about an app but this has been one helluva fun app, obviously there will be adds to support the app or you could buy the subscription but even without it you can still play the games that they have to offer or well most of them but it is still pretty fun and at least your not getting bombarded with adds every second and you can skip them pretty fast as well.  In conclusion, it‚Äôs a pretty good app for training your brain and it is quite fun as well, there are some adds but not too many and there is a subscription to stop the adds and to unlock everything, I suggest to give it a chance to see if it‚Äôs your cup of tea and if it‚Äôs not then I guess this app is not for everyone."
5,Waldrop has a,"So how I love this game is like it challenges you to do all the stuff like if you don‚Äôt know like 5√ó6 with one of my questions I think I got it right maybe so like if you don‚Äôt know that answer it‚Äôs OK it‚Äôs sometimes it‚Äôll be timing you but it‚Äôs OK to get answer wrong like it doesn‚Äôt matter whatever age you are it doesn‚Äôt care but I played this game for like so long I‚Äôve been like a pro but like now I‚Äôve been I my babysitter who‚Äôs name is Miss Vicky I she has this game and it‚Äôs called Impulse and it‚Äôs so fun to play with and like not to play with play and it‚Äôs like so fun, entertaining like I love the sort, the trash and like it‚Äôs just so so fun and like just so fun so like I love it too much that I can‚Äôt stop playing it so like so so so so so so so it should be like sold everywhere like sold online and you should have to pay for it because it‚Äôs such a fun game like I love the money game. Whatever it is I love like the 123 there and just like I love the ghost one. I love Connect Dots I love adding them and subtracting and symbol where it‚Äôs like the symbol where it has like a X for it so I love that game and it is so fun to play with and guys whoever whoever made this game. Please put it all around the earth cause I love it."
5,Hellokittygirl2004,I like doing the tests on impulse especially the iq test because I try to improve my iq each day . Also I have the premium access yearly subscription I just renewed it recently because I like having no ads and access to all of the tests . Anyway I want to end my review with a tip for people who can‚Äôt afford the yearly subscription. Ok so if you put your device on airplane mode then you won‚Äôt receive any ads on games and this goes for all apps out there . One more thing I would like to see a test about dyslexia because it‚Äôs hard for me and others I know to comprehend what we read . Oh and I like the feedback after you do the tests because it helps me understand myself better and I‚Äôm trying to get my emotions under control and let go of the past and the tests are a big help to understand why I feel the way I feel . I hope everyone who reads this enjoys their day and I Just want to say I know what it feels like to be made fun of for being a quiet person and called names by people in school. It‚Äôs hard to put that in the past and let go of it but impulse tests are a great way to start understanding yourself.
3,KotyLinn,"ETA: I got a very nice response from the developers but I think they misunderstood me. I think it‚Äôs fine for devs to charge for their work. My problem is the general trend (incl this app) to not tell you the costs up front. You take a little test, the wend au you, and only then do you find out if, and what the cost is. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good app, I‚Äôm just unhappy with this business model, which seems to be ubiquitous now. Tell me up front what you want me to pay. Let me decide before giving you personal info and my time. That‚Äôs all.   There‚Äôs a current trend for companies to initially lead you to believe they‚Äôre free, then they ask you data gathering questions that also hook you in so that by the time you realize they want money, you‚Äôre primed to just pay what they ask. This app may be very good, and I don‚Äôt have a problem with them charging; the amount is not unreasonable. However I do have a problem with them not being upfront about it being a paid app. If it‚Äôs so good, why not let people know that you know your worth and tell them immediately that you‚Äôre charging? As I said, this is a pretty common trend rn so I don‚Äôt blame this app specifically, but I find it to be a sketchy business practice and it turns me off from paying, even the small amount this app is asking."
5,mcst56,"I really like this and expect,since this is only my second day, I will love it! I had moderate to severe traumatic brain injury in 2005. I had to learn to walk and talk and tried for 10 yrs to get back to my job, my profession-exercise rider for thoroughbred race horses. Sadly, I never could make it back so I clean inside or outside. I work for different types of people-all have their own desires and things that make one happy may not for 5 others so I HAVE TO REMEMBER A LOT!! This will help, I believe and, if possible, will tell you in 6 mos how much it has helped! My  only wish- that there was a program (affordable,like this one) for coordination and strength for traumatic brain injury survivors. The Only complaint I have is the tests they have after your training session do not actually apply to me because of my brain injury so some of the results about personality‚Ä¶are totally not me. I still know right from wrong when it comes to dealing with people and I love people and animals, as I always did.   I‚Äôm hoping, after reading this, someone who creates this program will be in touch with me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,Nana_Su,"Thanks to this app I now know  personality type and have been more of myself.  Knowing how i am on a scientific scale has helped me narrow down on my strengths and weaknesses and has since improved my ability to connect with my family, friends and even in my marriage. Everyone I know has taken the personality test and has inevitably had the ‚ÄúAhah‚Äù moment. Upon sharing with others we all say‚Äù well that makes sense. ‚Äú This app has fantastic games that are challenging, fun and really get the brain juices flowing as they get harder. I really like the diversity in games and the fact that they all challenge in different important skills. My favorite are the ones where you have to put a box together in your mind and be able to rotate it mentally to see all sides in order to be able to answer correctly. Another good one is the math challenge. Frankly for anyone like me or otherwise with the desire to see the world from multiple perspectives and solve problems with practical yet unconventional methods this is a great app to get short form challenges to stimulate the mind."
5,woonbdsfjkjrruu,"I do my brain training every morning and also enjoy the games that are not part of my daily training throughout the day. The daily training helps with brain function and speed and some games are timed. The additional games and puzzles are relaxing while still using your brain to think and solve puzzles and games of your choice.  I feel it helps me on a daily basis, especially with my job. I throughly look forward to playing this every day and also in the evenings.  I did find one small glitch that I do not know how to share the information and screen shot with the developer. It‚Äôs a game where you are shown a group of numbers, and the goal is to find the missing number in the sequence from another small group of numbers. In this case I was instructed to ‚ÄúFind the missing numbers in the sequence from 1 to N and tap on the correct answer. Of course N was not a choice because it is not a number.  Definitely download this free app and have a blast while keeping your brain young and healthy!"
5,"frisk, chara, and sans","I don't exactly pay for anything on the app store considering I feel the need that I don't have to. It's hard finding good and productive apps to help me succeed mentally and keep me on the right track, most of them are in-app purchases and you can only get so far before you can't do anything else without paying. Impulse is a good app for letting you use the app for free for however long and you can pay for more options if you feel free to. There are different training exercises that focus on different parts of your brain, it will also show how you did after the game.   The app gives different games everyday so even if you complete all of the games you can play more the next day and repeat. The app helps me most with memory since I can't remember a lot of things, it builds strength to the brain and its very beneficial. The app keeps me from getting bored and it's educational, kind of like when your a kid and you don't realize the educational games are helping you learn since your having fun in the process."
3,kurt.iss,"So I‚Äôm fine with ads. Shoving them down my throat does absolutely nothing to encourage me to pay. Lol instead I don‚Äôt pay just out of spite. But when you show a questionable ad that only got worse once I tried reporting it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when there‚Äôs a problem. Especially since I‚Äôm good at certain games and after every level there‚Äôs an ad. Which is fine.. but not when it‚Äôs showing a woman bending over with her behind arched up as high as it can go so that it‚Äôs eye level with a dude basically sniffing her snatch.. If I wanted to see that all that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd go watch porn on a platform made for porn. Not an app that‚Äôs rated ages 4+ with no way to report such ads. Obviously it‚Äôs not straight up porn but it‚Äôs so implied that it looks like you‚Äôre watching porn. Fortunately I found a loophole to skip all ads. If you add a report feature that will allow the user to stop seeing ads from a specific company/developer (because the developers make several different ads), then I‚Äôll go ahead and tell you how anyone can skip the ads, without violating any terms and conditions.  Edit: I‚Äôm not turning on personalized ads to change what ads I get."
5,AlienX_MT,"If you‚Äôre looking for an app that‚Äôs fun, relaxing and keeps your mind occupied/focused, this is it. I‚Äôve only had this app for a short period of time but I can already say I enjoy it so much. I haven‚Äôt been in school for years, since then I‚Äôve been working full time but I always felt the need to keep my brain active and this app does just that. There‚Äôs many different games, puzzles, quizzes, etc to choose from and the best part is that they keep track of your progress throughout every different criteria. An example of a test I took was the Personality test and let‚Äôs just say after I learned my personality type I realized a lot about myself . I‚Äôm not saying the tests are 100% accurate but for me at least I benefited from finding out. I even did my own research on the personality type impulse gave me and it was nearly spot on for the type of person I know I am personally. Definitely check out this it. Btw there are ads but you can skip them, I find them Annoying so I‚Äôll probably end up subscribing for no ads."
5,heyarron,"I saw this being advertised on Instagram and had been in the mood to get back into brain training. I truly believe everyone should have a brain training app, but this one beats them all. I‚Äôve used the competitors BAXK in the past when I was in high school, now that I‚Äôm older, I can say this one has a more in-depth method of training and the games are really addicting. So much so I don‚Äôt want to do the recommended games, I want to play them all! But strict habits are good long term so I keep reserved, haha. Anyhow, they have different areas of brain training. You have your daily, then you have certain sections, I.e: Memory, Mental Math, etc. I got the 50% lifetime and honestly best money I‚Äôve spent. If you want to sharpen focus, mental math, or even just feel like you‚Äôre not as ‚Äòsharp‚Äô as you used to be, you need to get this app and the subscription to follow. IQ tests on here and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never seen those other apps have. Grateful for discovering this organization. I don‚Äôt even write reviews but this is one that had to be written."
5,Mganwe Shikoto,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but in this case, I decided to make an exception. So glad I came across this app a few weeks ago! Thanks to it I finally realized how poor my math skills are... But the thing is they were not like this all the time! Back at school, I was really good at math, not the best in the class, but really good! And look at what happened... I avoided doing some simple math on my own, thinking it would save me some time (or maybe I was just lazy), and as a result, having faced the tasks in Impulse math category, I saw how big my problem is. Huge, actually. The tasks and the games are not that difficult, they really aren‚Äôt. And back in the day, they would be a piece of cake for me. And now it feels like starting all over... But the good thing is that doing it with the app helps! I‚Äôve been getting better and hope for more results!  My only suggestion would be to include more games to the Language category, just like Math it seems really useful. Oh, and the math lessons! They‚Äôre amazing! But it took me time to find them. Thank you!!!"
1,JaeWC,"It says the day before, but it‚Äôs 24 hours prior. Policy was not updated since 2023 canceling subscription very misleading. Continuously refers to Apple subscriptions vaguely tells you. Vaguely tells you you have to login on their actual website but policies and subscription terms continuously lead you back to your sub subscription page. Invoices do not go through Apple. They did not itemize to other charges and these charges happen after cancellation. You will continuously receive emails regarding your support ticket and their policy states that they will tell you about any changes to their fees. You will not receive an email, but check your bank account for multiple charges. On top of your subscription charge there may be other charges in odd amounts. And on their policy, they refer you back to Apple regarding refunds  Apple does not have any receipts for Impulse subscriptions. An Apple will probably redirect you back to the app company there is no way to remove any payment information, they will just go through Apple to charge you. Very misleading company is not in the US. Initial screen will tell you to do it the day before your subscription. But policy reflects 24hrs."
4,kkunicorn321,"Since I‚Äôve added this to my daily routine I‚Äôve honestly felt more motivated and have been doing well with thinking on my feet, which I am very grateful for. However, in the app they bombard you with deals off the premium subscription, they give you up to ‚Äú96% off!!‚Äù Claiming it‚Äôll only be there for a while, which isn‚Äôt really true. It doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay though because you can still play some games, and you can complete your daily challenges without premium. My big issue is the tests that they have. Some include trauma response tests, IQ tests, etc. I wanted to do one, so I took the time to complete the test, and then only afterword was I told that I needed premium to see my answers‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm not here to beg to make the app totally free, but at least state a somewhere clearly that you need premium to unlock your answers. Or just don‚Äôt allow people to take the test unless they have premium. Anyway, that‚Äôs pretty much the only thing I have against this game, and all in all it‚Äôs been a great addition to my daily routine!!! Thanks!!!"
1,TheRealDaniYell,"Was charged for free trial canceled after saw charges since it said free trial, immediately submitted claim to apple says that there is a refund update but nothing there, complaint sent to apple, customer service of impulse and my credit card company please refund immediately I would never buy this product, I was using 3 day free trial and was fraudulently charged for the app instead of getting the free trial. I have done everything in my power to correct this problem and will not stop until I get my money back from this fraudulent product and scam. Will continue to report and contact support, I need help from an actual human being not ai who automatically denies claims HUMAN CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGEMENT HELP NOW. Now a generic response from the application bot ai, Don‚Äôt download it I had to contact my bank and change my card number and have them fix it as no response from apple, or the application and all of the 5 star reviews are fake bots, as you can see from their response they didn‚Äôt address any of the issues or problems don‚Äôt download and if you do understand that none of the features are free, no support, and to cancel and be refunded you will have to contact your financial institution."
4,MinaMayneminks,"So far I have played the game for two days and I like the fact of being challenged . and not knowing what to expect next. This game so far seems to give me a challenge based off of things that we have to deal with every day in daily life issues. Whether those things are good things or bad things, things that you have to ponder on etc. it challenged you and took you out of your zone that you may have been in at that moment. I‚Äôm looking forward to learning new things expanding my brain span ,and being challenged daily, because what I‚Äôm beginning to see go on in this world‚Ä¶ we need to stay woke ,and pay attention to what‚Äôs actually happening before our eyes while being distracted with daily nuances. So we all need things that we can focus in on daily, to help keep us focused on what‚Äôs important .I think this game will be a segue into that for lots of people that find it hard to multitask at times, becauseWe get distracted. Being able to focus is important for anything that we do in life, and I think that this game is just fun tool that could help."
5,818383893,"I love the new game each time, and how they begin easy to learn how well you do.  The game said that the next time the game will be harder, but for the week or three that I finally started playing it (my adhd daughter recommended it to me because other games would bore me as soon as i got really good at them.   Each game has benefits, an example is one where you had to remember which squares had a football helmet, representing opponents. They disappeared and then two footballs appear. You have to make a path from one football to the second without using the square a helmet was in , using only your memory.   They do a tutorial and just allow it to play out, don‚Äôt rush it, and you should then fully understand how the game works.  You never play the same game twice in a row.  (Unless you select replay). It‚Äôs helpful for neurodivergent people and anyone who wants to help their memory skills develop.  I really enjoy it, but I think that‚Äôs obvious by now haha."
5,NoraJ.K,"I didn‚Äôt expect I need anything like Impulse, but after watching the ad on Instagram I decided to try. And I‚Äôm so happy I saw that add!! The app is amazing, user experience is so neat and the color scheme is perfect. What i like the most is that I only need  5 min per day to stretch my brain muscle. So I complete daily brain sessions and feel really better (on a 17th training day now). Pricing is a bit tough in case of taking a monthly subscription, but I successfully utilized the Christmas offer the app proposed. Just for the price of 4 cups of coffee I now can have lifelong brain training!! I would advise the developer to add some brain music and sounds, say for focus, productivity, concentration (I personally consider this to be crucial for effective working or studying). Apart from that, are you planning to add some training streaks? I noticed in other apps that this feature motivates me the most. But anyway the app is great and i recommended it to my friends and family (and i‚Äôm not the type of a person to recommend every stuff i see)"
5,gaisbdvdiwowbdv,"its a really good app, really works the brain and etc. I have a bit of ADHD so it gets kinda hard to focus on it without gettin overwhelmed with the repetitiveness in some of the games. It really the games are really fun tho, puts your brain to work. To me the repetitive games are hardest because again, ADHDüôÑbut its helped me a bit with being more focused and believe it or not, you can get better with being more observed and pay attention to detail a lot more, it helped me a lot! Right now i‚Äôm 20 yrs of age and plan on having children with my gf. If any of you people are parents and see that your kid is struggling in someway educationally, i advise that you download this app and get them into this. I definitely plan on gettin my future kids into this; it can really help them get more focused more organized and so on. It even gives you back the results/reports of what you‚Äôve done. But yk with any app you gotta pay for a plan to get em(but hey, they gotta make their money, can‚Äôt hate on that)"
5,not hardworking for me,"This app is AWESOME I‚Äôm talking AWESOME. so first off, the app has ads only every once and a while, not every second and they are pretty chill because you only have to wait five to ten seconds to skip. They also have sales that one times gave 92% off of a premium package just because I picked the right box. You can also just remove ads for 5$ without ur having to buy the whole premium package. The app is also so fun for an adulation and mind game. The mini games that they do are so fun!!!! And yet it also tell you what it will improve on. For example one game might say at the bottom, ‚Äúimproves creative thinking‚Äù You can also start a streak and play little work out games every day. I honestly love this game so far after I got it YESTERDAY. I play it every day before bed or in the day when I‚Äôm bored because it‚Äôs usually hard to find fun games without getting bored of them. So I think this is the perfect game for all ages and all genders. DOWNLOAD IT IT‚Äôs WORTH IT"
5,BetaPreacher,"It‚Äôs great so far! I originally got it when I saw the AD on tik tok. I thought it was gonna be another bad app, but it‚Äôs actually not. It actually gives you exercises and games and tests that allow you to see things in a different light and jog your memory on things that maybe you need more focus on. For me, I need focus for my job. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to focus sometimes because I have so many things in life that I‚Äôm dealing with, and I get cluttered. This allows me to be active for my brain in my off time, because honestly, everything else started getting boring, even Tik tok! It doesn‚Äôt feel mindless and boring, allowing me to at least grow while in my spare time and not wasting seconds, hours, days on mindless entertainment. The best part is that they‚Äôre not the same questions every time, math problems, vocabulary questions. If you need touch ups on your brain and maybe need to learn something new, this is the app for you!"
2,cakb777,"I got this app thinking that I could relax by doing some fun puzzles for free. I have never seen so many lengthy ads that force you to interact with them as I have in this app. Due to the annoyance of having to deal with the same lengthy ads after ever one or two free activities that I did in the game, a pop up came up saying that I could get the great deal of having ads blocked for $2.99. I went ahead and did it. Then I kept playing and ads kept popping up. When I contacted the app customer service about this they replied that the ad block was only for that one specific puzzle out of all of the activities in the app. They also said this was ‚Äúclearly stated‚Äù in the pop up, which with I disagree. All I saw was the words ‚Äúad block for 2.99.‚Äù If I had known, I would not have paid for that and I would just have probably deleted this app. There are other comparable apps that are interactive and good for different types of brain training, albeit in separate apps, but unless you pay for this app (which is actually a subscription either weekly or yearly) it is too frustrating to use."
1,AustinC96,"This application is partnering with algorithms that harvest user data such as Instagram and Tiktok in order to push fraudulent advertisements tailored to individuals that are more likely to click and buy a subscription. I have ADHD. My TikTok and Instagram algorithms know this. I recently started seeing Impulse ads on both platforms that states ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS YOUR ADHD TYPE? TAKE THE TEST‚Äù implying that, within the app, there was some sort of ADHD type test. I thought ‚Äúthat sounds interesting‚Äù and started a free trial. Interestingly, this test was nowhere to be found. I thought ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs a premium feature?‚Äù so I mistakenly subscribed for $6.99 (I will be getting my money back from Apple). Nope. No ‚ÄúADHD type test‚Äù anywhere. In fact, upon googling ‚Äúimpulse app ADHD test‚Äù I was shocked to find there are NO results except for the TikTok and Instagram ads themselves. Then it clicked, that this developer is utilizing apps with access to marketing and personal data to push fraudulent ads in a targeted manner. The brain-scan images that the company used in their advertisement, hilariously, have nothing to do with ADHD. They are stolen from an academic paper.  ADDON - THE APP KEEPS DOWNLOADING ITSELF AFTER YOU DELETE IT. This is absolutely malicious"
5,PC Ganger Gamer,"I am not the type of person to download games on my phone mainly a PC gamer Sometimes PS5 so never really understood why I would play games on my phone just takes up space. This is a great game to challenge yourself and keep your mind positively active, almost like a brain workout. Now For premium version being the price of $6.99/WEEKLY is really WILD just Utterly ridiculous. I know they probably do that so kids pay for it then their parents just continue to pay it not realizing what they re paying for, but a game on your phone for $364+ a year?!?!?! Things like this needs to stop. It‚Äôs just robbery people just want to take advantage of people. Smh to what the world has become. $364+ for a game on your phone that you might barely even use is crazy to me at least. They pray that most people will pay for it then just let that $7 slip by every week forever or until they are broke then they just don‚Äôt care after that. Smh it‚Äôs sad."
4,SpookyCatsandPJO,"This app is okay. I had it recommended to me by a friend, who said that she thought it was amazing. So I was disappointed when the game started giving me ads after pretty much every game. Not to mention these ads would always lag, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to close the ad or even participate in the playable portion, because the ad would be lagging or frozen to some degree.  Another issue with this app is the games and the way most of them judge wether or not you pass. They compare how well you did to how well you did compared to ‚Äúyour peers‚Äù what peers? There‚Äôs a thing people say, you shouldn‚Äôt compare yourself and your success to the success of others. This app directly goes against that saying! I don‚Äôt care if I did better than 2% of my peers, I‚Äôm just doing the best I can for myself, and it‚Äôs really challenging to have to keep doing it over and over just to reach some random number like 76%!!   I think it‚Äôs a pretty hood app overall, but could definitely cut back on some of the ads."
5,johnybeast1,"An amazing discovery for all those who search for self-improvement. I wanted to use my time in commute in an efficient and fun way and that's why I searched for brain games in the first place. Impulse absolutely lived up to my expectations! I love their workouts - a little bit of work every day gives me a sense of fulfillment, it's not that I just played some goofy game on the phone, I actually DID something to develop my memory and improve focus. One thing to consider there is the brain-boosting habits, maybe it's worth paying more attention to them? Very often they seem appropriate and cool, but since they're not explained or anything, I just ignore them. If the workout is not enough for me, I can always go to the games and spend as much time as I want playing whatever game I like. My favorite category is Focus, so I play it the most, and recently I noticed that it became easier for me to concentrate at work. Probably, I'll try to binge-play other categories as well, hope the results will be just as good!"
5,Lil Baby 41,I have been working in private home health every since I was a kid about 8 years old when I turned 18 years old I started working in the nursing homes and other medical facilities that involves the elderly it‚Äôs been over 10 years ago when I started working with Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia patients which I owe it all to my grandmother on my dad side of the family she was my first patient I was totally honored to take care of my grandmother she took me in at the age of 14 I wanted to make sure I was giving my grandmother the best of care any known to mankind we did card games board games word puzzles word search puzzles even coloring I wish this was out when my grandmother was still alive I know she would‚Äôve enjoyed it just as much as my patients I take care of now I got patients at the age of 60+ they look forward to playing these games so please keep up the great work just a positive reminder this is changing lives and we are all grateful üòá
5,Kar¬•n,"Must say impressive and actually pretty cool. Didn‚Äôt know if I would actually like it as much as I do. I haven‚Äôt tried all the options they have like the ‚ÄúIQ‚Äùand ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù type, right now I‚Äôm just training my memory along with keeping my brain & mind sharp. And the games provided for the level im on is pretty intense and exciting. The levels increase in difficulty as u pass each one. Which is where the intensity comes in for me. I only do it for 5 minutes a day. Bc I don‚Äôt want to get to addicted to it. I think it‚Äôs to late for that now.  I always read the reviews before downloading or putting my time into one much less leave my opinion on a review. But this one was actually worth it. So good job to the developers and everyone behind on the making of this which took some talent and time. Very satisfied!! ü§©ü§© will keep playing until it won‚Äôt let me play for free anymore."
4,username's taken.,"More of a support ticket but, certain question on the test such as, ‚ÄúDo you tend to think in more images or words?‚Äù Only has two responses. Though, while I‚Äôm sure that most people only can pick one or the other, I tend to think in both at the same time if possible. Answer choices such as images or words exclude those who think in both. It‚Äôs just a suggestion that you add more moderate answers for a couple of the questions, or all. The other tests I personally didn‚Äôt have too much problems with, yet I‚Äôm sure someone will complain anyways in the same way I am. It‚Äôs a great application that helps those who struggle with certain things, such as memory, strengthening your peripheral vision, focus, and more. The games are also engaging and easy to get into. So if you‚Äôre a person who is looking to acquire this application, get it, it‚Äôs worth it. To the developers, this is just a suggestion, you don‚Äôt have to follow through on it. Good job, keep it up!"
1,Mortal Fool,"Nope. Don‚Äôt go near this. I have never heard of this app and certainly didn‚Äôt agree to subscribe weekly (who pays $6.99 per WEEK???? ) but have been charged for more than 6 months until I finally noticed the small charges hiding among other charges on my credit card. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs intentional so that when someone accidentally subscribes (Again I do not think I did. I know not to press that button for a free trial and get sucked in) then they get $$$ out of you.  Apple won‚Äôt consider a refund except for the last week. Shame on them! And they threatened that if I take it up with my credit card, my whole Apple account will be deactivated. A quick google search tells me they will do so. So basically bullying me. I have NEVER disputed a subscription or  in-app purchase in many years as an Apple customer. Not once!  I am educated and technically literate (my degree is in computer science) so it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm an idiot and don‚Äôt know how this works. If I made some mistake that signed me up for this, it would only be because it is set up to trap people. Predatory practice!  I‚Äôve reached out to the app developers and no response."
2,Level743CandySorter,"I got some really misleading ads for this app over the summer, which claimed ‚Äúfind your ADHD type!‚Äù And I was really curious, so I downloaded it. Well‚Ä¶only the paid version will allow you to take quizzes and see results so I bit the bullet and paid for the year subscription, which was ultimately the best value. I‚Äôll use it all year for brain training I thought! Well I set it up and started taking available quizzes‚Ä¶ turns out there are only like 12 quizzes, and ‚Äúyour adhd type‚Äù is not really one of them. It was more of a ‚Äúdo you have adhd‚Äù quiz which you could easily find elsewhere onlkne, and I and my doctor could already tell you the answer to that! Other quizzes are basic personality or IQ tests. I fell out of routine with the brain games and fixated on the candy sorter game. Now it‚Äôs my doom-scrolling-anxious-compulsion-look-at-my-phone-forever game and it‚Äôs the only part of this app I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm just disappointed that I paid $50 for it. A bad investment for the habitually anxious or inattentive. But I‚Äôm at level 743 on the candy sorter game (which doesn‚Äôt get harder after level 100)"
4,UserNameUnknown84,"I am using the free trial right now (a bit disappointed that it is only for 3 days!). I have been searching for something to do to unwind at the end of a long crazy day and this is perfect as it keeps my mind active but I can also choose less of a challenge if I have been overstimulated all day and only want to relax. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt afford almost $7.00 a week on anything extra with being a single mom of 4 and barely scraping by. But maybe one day it won‚Äôt as expensive as it is and I will most definitely go for the full access. Awesome concept, just wish it was more affordable! The reason for the 4 stars is just the weekly cost. I am aware it‚Äôs the same price as someone may spend daily on a coffee but Im not in a financial place to do any spending at all outside of scraping to get by each day. Lord Willing my children and I will be in a much better financial situation sooner rather than later! So in the meantime, thanks for the 3 days!"
5,JKalegi,"Impulse brain training is something I look forward to doing everyday. There is a great selection of training sessions, with good instructions. I have the option to tell Impulse if I like a particular game or not and why. After each game I see my score and how it compares to my previous score. I recently had to re-install the Impulse app. My iPhone is a little older and locked up. Since January, 2024 I have been using Impulse and definitely know my memory has increased a lot!!! Too bad I had to loose all the work done previously. Oh well, Impulse is such an excellent brain training tool, starting over just means I will not run out of sessions for a long time. Give Impulse a try. You will love the variety of brain training ‚Äúgames‚Äù. Your memory recall will start to speed up! You will feel good knowing you are doing something important to keep your brain sharp. Use IMPULSE everyday!!!!"
1,Sergey Gutsko,"Happily was utilizing their free trial period that implied that all features and games would be unlocked, so I also took an IQ test which lasted for fifteen continuous minutes. First, notice that the tests have an almost hidden disclaimer at the very bottom of each test overview that states: ‚Äúfor entertainment purposes only.‚Äù I overlooked it so I took it anyway, and then at the very end they give you a sneak peak of your results and then ask you to PAY even if you‚Äôre already on a free trial. What a scam. I was excited so I paid for a weekly subscription anyway, but notice how they don‚Äôt mention this ‚Äúdisclaimer‚Äù on the purchase screen, they just do everything they can to minimize cutting you off the lead and take your money. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs really dumb, much wiser would be being more transparent with their customers to build long-term trust and reputation. But this‚Ä¶ this is no different from other mainstream ‚Äúbrain tests‚Äù and ‚Äúexercises‚Äù you find on the web‚Äîwhere all they want is just your cash. The test result wasn‚Äôt even comprehensive, no mention what scale they used or base for questions. But my money is already gone. Obnoxious."
4,ms_coach_wilson,"Hey yall! I love this game!!! Just wanted to let yall know there are some bugs I've found - hopefully can be fixed... When I got to somewhere around Level 1430 on the marble color sort game... It's messed up... whole game runs normally until the last marble. It sticks/freezes and won't let me put the last marble in the container... I've tried rearranging the marbles for diff. ones to be the ""last move"" but it doesn't fix. The last marble glitches sometimes to moving a few marbles before after 10-15 seconds giving a go ahead to the next level. Today I tried closing/locking my phone. So when it's down to the last move - I just lock my phone... when i sign back in my phone with face or password it does allow me to do the last move and continue. I've been playing and in love with this game FOR A WHILE now and would love if yall can fix before I beat the game (or add more levels LoL that'd be awesome too) Thanks for all you do and creating this awesome app!!!"
1,Jessica - mycurvystore.com,"When I saw this app it looked great(my sister has it) so I looked it up on App Store to try it out. It was pretty fun, cute mini games. I liked it okay. But WHY do you say that you can diagnose people with ADHD?!? Don‚Äôt even TRY to say that because I doubt that the developers have a medical degree and using a disability as your marketing plan is PATHETIC. Some people might stress if some ‚Äúapp‚Äù says that they are disabled!? Imagine a person who knows that they have ADHD saw this app and thought they couldn‚Äôt play/do any other apps because they had ADHD!! This ‚Äúapp‚Äù says that ONLY people with ADHD could play this game?! Like WHAT?! Who MADE this?! This is not a good app at ALL. I have deleted this ‚Äúapp‚Äù because it has claimed that they can ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù people like doctors. Say someone downloaded this and was ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with ADHD and then went to a doctor and wasn‚Äôt. Imagine what they would think of this ‚Äúapp‚Äù then! My sister deleted this too. To people reading this: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! It contains FAKE information and developers? You might think ADHD isn‚Äôt serious but it is!!! Using it as your marketing tool is SO stupid I am even ashamed for downloading it in the first place!!"
1,NevilleIsHott101,"I downloaded this app to check it out, so I started with a 3-day trial.  I immediately liked the games it took me through but upon exiting the game, I got an alert that my credit card was charged IMMEDIATELY for the trial I started today.   In addition (though this is often the case!), the quiz shown in the ad for the app is not even remotely what is offered in the app itself.   In addition, since even the three-day ‚ÄòPro‚Äô trial leaves many things behind a paywall, I went to buy a weekly subscription, with ‚Äúcancel anytime‚Äù clearly marked and highlighted, I got charged for an entire year at once.    I thought the quality is good, I appreciated the opening quiz, and I liked the sense that there‚Äôd be a path to follow‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt trust this game to be responsible with how it marks subscription fees, and I‚Äôll be uninstalling it and disputing the charges.   I think developers work hard and deserve to be paid for their work ‚Äî and I would have enjoyed keeping this app and paying for a subscription, but I don‚Äôt feel I can trust this particular app to not lead me down a rabbit hole of requiring more and more money to view content.  Bummer."
2,Wandering J,"These are some genuinely fun, challenging games. Some are even relaxing, like Candy Sort. The variety of games is great. The two star rating, however, is due to so many games running against a countdown timer. It is counterproductive for ‚Äúself improvement‚Äù for the player to have to race ‚Äî and fail ‚Äî against an arbitrary countdown timer. It should be a simple timer to allow the player to complete the task and see how long it took, which then creates a goal to improve upon without feeling frustrated at never finishing the game. Taking away points when one fails just compounds the detrimental effects. Doing well in one of the timed games also just means next time you have to do more rounds (or have a higher number of things to process) in the same amount of time, so essentially it goes back to making you fail. These are not games to improve brain function; they are just playing a win/lose, arbitrarily timed game. They would also be better as brain skill improvement if they provided tips based on one‚Äôs performance."
5,Iabes,"The games are pretty fun to play and it also tells you how well you did relative to other people in your age range which gently motivates you to do better (if you like competitive games) while also keeping you updated on your progress. Some of the games are similar to the sort of testing I had done during my neuropsyche. eval. for ADHD so I feel like that adds to its credibility of being a brain-stimulating app. I also like how they paced the increase in difficulty of each game. When you‚Äôre further along in a game you can give feedback on if the last level was too difficult or easy which adjusts the next level accordingly. The games definitely feel stimulating to say the least, plus there‚Äôs a bunch of em so you‚Äôll likely not get too bored or just good at one game if you play with the intention of bettering your brain.   P.S. the UI is very user friendly"
5,georgiablondy45,"I am a recoverinopen brain injury from about 10 years ago. My mind is not as sharp as it used to be and I have a very hard time remembering things, especially my short term memory. This game has helped me tremendously and I can actually feel the difference in parts of my head that haven‚Äôt been used, (if that makes any sense) in such a long time. Granted I‚Äôm not the fastest one to complete the task but I do get it done. I can tell a slight difference within my memory issues and Ive only been doing it a couple of weeks. It feel so rewarding to know that I can ‚Äúwake‚Äù my brain up in certain areas. My neurologist recommended a application just like this to try and get me healthy results and it makes me feel so much better  no more embarrassing moments when I can‚Äôt remember something mid sentence. Great app, I love it and would most definitely recommend it to neurological patients."
5,ashleyenicholson,"After going through chemo a few years at 30, my brain doesn‚Äôt function the way it used to. I love this bc it‚Äôs helping retrain my brain, improve memory and executive function skills. I had to do this with art too, to get my creative mind back. I always enjoy brain games for stimulation, I had it for one night, found myself playing it til 1A Ooops and decided to spend the $40 for the lifetime game. I like to invest in my health and this will be sooooo beneficial to get me back to my A game.   I was going to neuropsychologist and she gave me similar exercises. This is so much more cost effective than medical bills! They still don‚Äôt really know what causes chemo brain and there aren‚Äôt really therapies out there for it, so I‚Äôm all about trying anything that will help! It‚Äôs totally worth it, coming from someone who does not buy apps and uses free version of games‚Ä¶I made the exception for this one! ü§çü§çü§ç"
5,Bambalastri,"Impulse has been a great brain training app for me so far.  I felt a little discouraged with my results the first couple of times when I first started using this app, but the feedback I got from my results is complete enough that it indicated to me that, while my scores showed that I scored close to 100% accuracy in giving correct responses on almost every test, when compared to others in my age group, speed of in-putting the correct responses is also taken into consideration in comparison to others‚Äô scores in a similar age group.   By receiving this clear feedback, I could see that when the comparison percentages were shown, both accuracy and speed of the responses are the variables looked at when overall scores and comparisons are posted for my results.   Overall, a fun and challenging brain-game app.   Thank you for making this available in the App Store."
1,endjusbsisbsvsuwbwba,"While I know that essentially trying to lie to your customers to make a sale is the meta here: I‚Äôd really like to encourage the creators to stop. I‚Äôm now 10 times more suspicious and unlikely to download an app ESPECIALLY if they‚Äôre running ads on apps like tiktok because so many of yall just can‚Äôt be honest upfront. Offer the FREE assessment without needing my personal info and include some trial content. Tell me upfront what the premium is. If I like an app/product I‚Äôm likely to want to invest in it, and do all the time. I have zero issue with developers making money: I have an issue with using dishonest and manipulative tactics to make more sales. Take the ‚Äúfabulous‚Äù app for example. They disclose from the very beginning that a good part of their app is paid but offer enough of a trial and information for me to make an informed decision. I‚Äôve been subscribed for 4 years to them and as long as they remain honest and make a good app, I‚Äôll keep doing it. What I won‚Äôt be doing is giving money to a company who doesn‚Äôt think their app/product is good enough to stand on its own without manipulation of the consumer."
5,Awesome Spiritual Mentorship,"I am a Veteran and I have since developed different neurological disorders that prevent my brain from functioning ‚Äúnormally‚Äù. It has progressed to the point that I have to put things into my calendar in order for me to even remember the event at all. I played the trial version of this game and saw that it was challenging. It is Definitely Worth the money IF you have the budget for it. Sadly, most of us with brain issues have so much medical expenses that a helpful game like this, which I believe would help stabilize my brain functionality from deteriorating even further, is just not feasible in the budget.  In short, gift this game to someone in your life who is having issues with their memory and love to play daily play games to help with cognitive thinking, It is So Worth the fee!! Thank you for listening beautiful ppl! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,BAlexT,"Before I spend money on an app, I‚Äôd like to go read what kind of interaction the developer has with the reviews. this is just a bunch of canned responses sent from the developer. They don‚Äôt even read the critiques they just throw something out there that sounds like it might address it. So if you can‚Äôt bother to even look at the reviews are getting you‚Äôre not gonna pay attention when I have an actual complaint, so no money. Also, they like to say on all of their responses, you don‚Äôt have to pay to use this app, but you have to sign up for a paid subscription to get three days free trial and if you look at some of the reviews it‚Äôs very difficult to stop them from charging you anyway so I have no reason to trust them. What kind of response are you gonna give to this one? So the response is automatic, they don‚Äôt really care about what you have to say. They invite you to contact them directly but if they were actually reading the reviews, they would not have to ask you (the reviewer) to do more work, because they can‚Äôt be bothered."
4,#EatMyDust,"So this app is really great. As someone who worries about their mental health and if it is good or not, this app is important to me and is fun to do. The challenges are hard but fun and is over all good. But there is one thing I noticed. When you do the daily training program sometimes it will say ‚ÄúCompare to Others‚Äù when you finish it and a lot of times for things like the Math section and Problem Solving especially, just because I am slow at the topic it says I only beat like 1% or something low like that. So just because I am slow means I‚Äôm dumb? Because that is the vibe I am getting from you guys when it says that. And that is not fair, because my grades are really good in core subjects in school, but according to you all I am not smart because I‚Äôm slow. So please change this or at least do SOMETHING about this because I hope I am not the only one who feels this. Other than that this is a good app. üëçüèª"
3,Get it together BOSE!!!,"This is an interesting app. I have played a lot of mind training games. They are some of my favorite apps. This one is just ok on the brain training. One thing Indo not like about this app is the constant 99% score.  No matter how well I seem to do in different categories, the top score is 99. As an educator who specializes in success strategies, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Like the developers want me to keep coming back over and over to get that 100. I find this concept less motivating than beating a high score or something.  Sometimes some of the games do not set up correctly. I actually paid for a year of this app and then requested a refund for this very reason. This challenge added to the low motivation to create a less than ideal brain training app.  I would definitely compare this app to some of the others. If you want food archetype info this app will break that down for you. But the brain training is better found elsewhere."
5,Horse rider 10.0,"Ok first, I want to start off by saying‚Ä¶WOW! This app has helped me so much and I‚Äôve literally had it for 3 DAYS! I love it all. The games and tests are great. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about the tests is you can‚Äôt see the whole report. Like it‚Äôs ok if you have to buy it to see it lit up, but at least let us scroll down with the purchase thing on the screen so we can still see our report. Like, I found out I‚Äôm right-brained but I can‚Äôt see the results. Also, just a few suggestions, I‚Äôm only 11 so please make that an age group so I can see if I‚Äôm ahead of MY age group. Which also means I don‚Äôt understand all those huge words in the tests. You should also add more tests because I did all of them. Other than that great app and thank you so much for reading this, I do hope you consider these things. ‚Ñãùí∂ùìã‚ÑØ ùí∂ ‚Ñä‚Ñ¥‚Ñ¥ùíπ ùíπùí∂ùìé"
1,Taj72,"I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was a charge to use the features. After answering most general questions, app then informs you of weekly/monthly/annual charge or offers you a free 3 day trial that will auto renew if you don‚Äôt cancel. Because I hate those traps and can never easily find the cancelation I‚Äôve is started, I selected to quit the app and not sign up at all. Instead, the app continued and took me to the screen as though I‚Äôd accepted the free trial.  I immediately left the app and went to my subscriptions through Apple to try to cancel any subscription that it implemented without my consent. However, it didn‚Äôt show up in my subscriptions, but it did remain showing in my account as ‚Äúfree.‚Äù I have now wasted 30 minutes trying to figure this out. Ultimately, I deleted the app from my phone. Hopefully, that is sufficient to keep it off my subscription and account. I don‚Äôt know exactly what happened, but save yourself! If you don‚Äôt want to pay $6.99 a week for this app, don‚Äôt even open it!!! It‚Äôs a trap!!!"
5,moon@bookstore,"I fear brain doctors, for their worth of advice. That is all ‚Äú it is called a tooth‚Äù when first started legal tests. I was told I would have a different reflection other than what I am ,  I am here taking this review lightly! And I want to learn self inspiration out of the many things I had to learn and do. Thank you for the app! I will use it to the best of my conscious betterment to evolve a better connection through a history  that was commuted by war. And I value my life with most of all and a higher being does not bother me of just a shoulder shrug. HBO brain games since I was a kid. Was not a topic but today‚Äôs question. The brain doctors were part of my sympathetic life in hope of my pathetic being. I may feel a bit strange, but walking out from the light felt like a dead nail. Thanks for the app and please review my review with thumbs out!"
5,purehoetry,"I was hesitant to try because some ‚Äúbrain teaser‚Äù apps I don‚Äôt find useful enough for the price, but this one is well worth it. One of the only few educational apps I would put my money into. It is free to try, but to unlock access to all of the content does require a subscription of $7 weekly. However, you will find that these games are addicting, helpful, and aesthetically pleasing. They give you a very calming mindset and are lots of fun. I could play them for hours. I have noticed a great change in my day to day life since I started playing it daily. My awareness is sharper now. I find coming up with words in conversation is much easier than before. I am able to remember certain tasks and responsibilities that I would otherwise have trouble recalling. Such a wonderful app! Keep improving."
1,worst one-sided game,"Why would the app make you fast forward or attempt to exit an ad 3 times? Every time?  Because you care more about ad revenue and sacrifice customers happiness for the bottom line dollar.  It takes away anything slightly good this app had by switching over to the App Store cuz the tiny fast forward doesn‚Äôt actually exit the ad.  Only open a new page to fast forward that one? Which opens the App Store. And if you close it down, that does nothing but restart the countdown to wait more time to exit the ad for the 3rd time.  So you can go back to the menu to play another worthless game for 20 seconds.  It‚Äôs garbage, you don‚Äôt care.  You don‚Äôt care about my review. You don‚Äôt care about anything more than blood money from advertisements for more garbage games that do the exact same thing.  App Store will be better when Apple cleans out the trash.  Brain games.  Sure me knowing 5x3=15 really fast makes me higher than 99% of people my age.  Sure it does.  Ur ratings aren‚Äôt even legit.  Sure my IQ is 136.  I‚Äôm dumb just like this app."
5,Asha_88,"I‚Äôm New to this App, but so far I truly enjoy it!!! I‚Äôve been searching for an app that could rate my IQ & this is definitely the best app for that! Not only does it rate your IQ, it also helps train your brain. The games have levels, So you actually start out on an easy level & of course if you complete it with No problem it goes to the next level which is of course, more difficult. The only down side so far is the fact that you have to pay ($6.99) which isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôll be absolutely worth it when you‚Äôre literally getting smarter by using the App. I‚Äôm not sure how the (Free) version works, because I done the Free Trial, but I‚Äôll definitely do an UPDATE REVIEW at the end of my trial & give my Opinion of Everything. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing how much this App can ‚ÄúTrain This üß† of Mine‚Äù!!!"
1,tdogg2U,"Update: You need to stop trying to charge my Apple Pay. I cannot use it because I refuse to keep $ in there for you to steal. Your customer service refuses to help me and I can find zero subscriptions for this app. Someone please let me know how to stop you trying to take my money!  My fault for not reading the small print, but it appears I signed up for a monthly subscription at $30 a month and I don‚Äôt use the app. This was done via email, and terms of service say this type of subscription is handled by their customer service. The CS person that contacted me just stated to go into Apple subscriptions to cancel. When I explained there is no Apple subscription because it was via email the person refused to assist me and stated there is nothing anyone at the company can do. So I‚Äôm being charged $30 a month and zero people at this company can even talk to me about it. Now I will have to contact pay my bank to stop payment every month until this company gives up. The CS rep was extremely rude and totally not helpful."
5,Kanderson39,"I work nights at a factory. My time to do stuff is limited between work and spending time at home. I‚Äôve found that other apps like this tend to hardly work or feel to bland. These guys have found a way to make it feel fun and challenging while working with your schedule. It feels more convenient and easy to just pick up work on your daily tasks. The best part is that you can do so much more than just play cool little games. There are the games, puzzles, and tests that they offer and let you play on your own time and pace. It shows your growth in the different areas of your mind, and while also showing you where you scale in the group of people your age. I went ahead and bought the life time deal. It‚Äôs surprisingly a affordable and fun way to train your mind and work on where you lack."
5,CougClaws,"A few years ago I bled out. Shouldn‚Äôt be here. My brain showed little activity. My speech was a mess. Short term memory gone. Processing speed was horrible. Critical thinking skills lacked. Staying on task impossible. The Aphasia program was awesome, but dropped working with adults during the pandemic.   This App is pushing my brain in ways the Aphasia program used to. I‚Äôm an athletic person and am used to working up a sweat from physical activity‚Ä¶well this App can make me sweat. That‚Äôs how hard it‚Äôs making me work. It‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm scoring up 99% on tasks in comparison to other users. Considering what I‚Äôm recovering from - That. Is. Awesome!!!   Exercising the brain will provide improvements and give results beyond what the experts say is possible. All you have to do is work your brain off and anything is possible. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
5,#LovesToDance,"I absolutely LOVE this app! For a long time, I‚Äôve wanted an app with multiple bite sized brain challenges or puzzles to be able to solve. This app gave me just that! I love the Workout section (or at least the free workout so far), and although I haven‚Äôt had this app for long, I can definitely see myself using it for a while. I haven‚Äôt bought any of the subscriptions, but I still feel like I‚Äôm getting a lot out of this app. So, if you can‚Äôt afford the subscriptions but you still want an app like this, this is a great choice. I can understand that some people might get frustrated and or annoyed about the amount of ads, but compared to a lot of other games I think the amount of ads is worth it. Overall, I personally love this app and I would definitely recommend!"
3,Sutten M,"Frankly, this app is great for what it is. The games are fun, and the tracking is great. However, I was misled when I purchased a life time copy of this game. Perhaps I mis understood the nature of the sale, but this is a subscription service HOWEVER you can also purchase life time access to this app by paying a lump sum fee up front. I chose to do that during a sale they were having specifically for that deal. This was a few months ago.  After purchasing that life time access, I was STILL charged monthly for the subscription. I feel like I was mis led. Not accusing anyone of saying that it is a scam, but these guys 100% need to work on their wording when they say ‚Äúlife time access after paying this‚Äù but not explaining that you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee. To that end, buyer beware.   3 stars cause the actual content is great. -2 stars because the way they process their transactions are mis-leading at best."
5,Nmorris1776,"Fantastic Brain Training and Self-Discovery Tool!  This app is a hidden gem for anyone looking to boost their mental agility and gain insights into their own personality! Not only does it offer a diverse range of brain training games that are both fun and challenging, but it also includes quizzes, surveys, and psychological tests that help you dig deeper into who you are.  The games cover everything from memory and problem-solving to reaction time and pattern recognition. Each one is well-designed, engaging, and gives just the right level of challenge to make you feel accomplished without feeling overwhelmed. I‚Äôve found myself coming back to play these daily‚Äîit‚Äôs like a mental gym session that‚Äôs genuinely enjoyable!  The surveys and psychological tests are a great touch too. They don‚Äôt just give you cookie-cutter answers; the results are insightful and help paint a nuanced picture of different facets of your personality. You get to learn more about how you think, how you relate to others, and where your strengths lie. It‚Äôs an amazing blend of brain games and self-discovery that makes this app really stand out.  Highly recommend this app to anyone looking to stay sharp and curious about themselves. It‚Äôs not only useful but also so much fun! Five stars all the way!"
5,Unhappy User#X,"I have noticed my mental decline over the years and felt unsatisfied, so one day I realized I wanted to take action on it and do things to help me keep my mind sharp. That‚Äôs when I found Impulse and decided to give it a shot.   Ultimately, the results speak for themselves. I‚Äôve been slowly making progress and I‚Äôm able to play certain games at a speed and precision I didn‚Äôt even realize I was capable. I cannot speak as to how well using Impulse has actually benefited me, but my mind feels sharp and I continue to get better by the day.   In terms of features I‚Äôd like to see in the future, I think there‚Äôs potential to include more gamification concepts such as streak freezes, leadership boards, and learning material to learn what could I do outside the app to keep working on keeping my brain sharp."
5,lucentgem,"I love this app: it‚Äôs great for ADHD brain training and it‚Äôs one of the few apps I use regularly. The games are fun, but definitely help in the areas they‚Äôre meant to, and I‚Äôve noticed improvements in multiple areas.   The one major problem I‚Äôve had with it is the super bright background at launch. I have a disability which includes photophobia and I always use Dark Mode. I get migraines when I have to look at a very bright white background, bright lights, flashing lights, etc.. I‚Äôm also a night person and use this app most often before bed. This means that the bright background is jarring. The darker backgrounds for the games area awesome and I wish there was an option for system settings, or an active dark mode we can switch to to avoid the shock to our eyes."
5,pureboi92,"I‚Äôve been using the app for a couple weeks and really enjoy it. The games are pretty unique and helped me understand what skills I‚Äôm good at and which ones I need to train more. I like that the ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù section shows you the average score for each category and specific game. I think it would definitely be nice to see the average score based on training skill too. For example, I noticed that my ‚ÄúSelective Attention‚Äù was high based on the high scores I got in a few games. I also noticed my ‚ÄúWorking Memory‚Äù wasn‚Äôt as high based on some lower scoring games. I think it would definitely help seeing that in the ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù section so we can keep in mind what we need to work on. Maybe even some links to research articles or something for each training skill would be useful too"
5,Jessicaelise12345,"Love it! I bought this app for a healthy alternative to my nightly doom scrolling habit on social media with all those targeted ads that don‚Äôt add value to my life/only make me feel like I need to buy things. I‚Äôm on an 84 day streak on Impulse and my skill progress has increased substantially. So many great puzzles to choose from and they all get increasingly more challenging so I don‚Äôt get bored like other repetitive and pointless app games. My social media time has cut down significantly and I feel great exercising my brain instead. Also, Instead of opening my social apps when I first wake up, I play a few quick puzzles on Impulse and it helps me wake up and energize my mind through puzzle solving and has reduced my procrastination anxiety in the mornings before my work day or exercise routine. Highly recommend."
3,RebelMonkey,"I‚Äôve had this app (and paid for a subscription) for awhile and use it every day. I noticed that in the last update, they took away the 3 hints on Words Crosswords and now you can only get them by watching ads. üëéüèºüëéüèº Updates should add things not get rid of things. Also, the game doesn‚Äôt work properly now. Some words in the puzzle won‚Äôt fill in but register as already found so you have to find all the words without seeing that you found them to complete the puzzle.  Plus, I‚Äôve finished all the levels for several games with promises of new levels. Still waiting. They did swap out icons in the games for new ones. Yes, they‚Äôre nice-looking but my brain is used to the old ones so it feels like I‚Äôm starting all over again with memory exercises except I‚Äôm still on the harder levels.  Was excited about an update that was more than bug fixes and the app got worse."
5,HS technologist,"This game popped up when I was looking for word games. Then I discovered it was a brain-challenging game for various brain functions, some of which I felt were declining since COVID and aging. I found my strengths and weaknesses while having so much fun. I played for at least 4 or 5 hours the first day (though I had some obligations to finish). I ended up buying the year (for now) and set up my randomized daily challenges reminder. With each game, I have improved and learned ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù to get the right answers as well as completing them faster through practice. There are also other interesting ‚Äútests‚Äù that may give some insight to other brain concerns, like stress leveling and IQ, among others. Definitely worth the price. Looking forward to my daily challenges from Impulse and improving my brain plasticity!"
5,CharlieMahealani,"My entire life I have been considered a quite intelligent person by many standards but after experiencing a brain injury, memory loss due to ptsd and other mental health struggles and the general brain fog of motherhood twice over I often feel underwhelmed by my cognitive ability. I‚Äôm always subconsciously on the lookout for any way I can try to recover what I‚Äôve lost. On a whim I downloaded the app with no expectations, unsure if I would want to go beyond the three day trial. After just the first day, I knew I was going to be investing in a subscription. The games are actually fun (hubby thinks so too) and the assessment aspect makes it easy for me to get a bit competitive. There are insightful quizzes and helpful ‚Äúbrain workout‚Äù plans. I‚Äôm not sure if this will have any long term, measurable effects but I‚Äôm not disappointed at all!"
2,Will184858293,"If I recall I signed up with a trial. Very shady to have such a high price and list it weekly. There are some beneficial games but not worth it in my opinion. There are dozens of plan options but really I was surprised that I was subscribed on this plan, I don‚Äôt really remember doing it and I never would have intentionally signed up for something with such a high weekly price. If you get this app just make sure to really figure out how much you‚Äôre paying, what you get, and how often.  Also, for that price I still have to watch lengthy ads in between each round? I don‚Äôt understand how this app has such high reviews when there are plenty of other apps with similar or better games for an exponentially cheaper price or free, and this is the first one I have come across that charges you weekly.   To the developers, please don‚Äôt bother responding unless you significantly decrease your pricing to something reasonable, and fix this ad scheme."
5,Marshall Sr,"I just found out that I‚Äôm cognitively declining. My daughter thought that memory games could help with improving my mental cognition to bring it back into focus. I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I think these exercises will help me gain back the cognitive functions I once had or at least stop that disfunction in its tracks. I need to be engaged if I‚Äôm to start remembering things that I should‚Äôve never forgotten nor should‚Äôve never ever fumbling around to remember words and names. I believe after a few days I can gain some of my memory back with the support of these exercises but I‚Äôm also evaluating another mental exercise game and will see how it compare to this one. Based on what games best suits me, I will then purchase whatever game gives me the best challenge. Thanks!"
3,üëäBRO FISTüëä,"I never expect too much from apps like this these days because many of them promise things they don‚Äôt deliver on. $6.99 a week in my opinion is also asking too much when there are a lot of free (or at least inexpensive) online services that provide similar personality, IQ, ADHD and many more tests. At the very least, you should be allowed to explore all of the features of the app in the free trial (which is only 3 days). How else am I supposed to decide if I enjoy the app enough to pay for it? The free trial allows you to take tests and do puzzles, but withholds the results unless you purchase the full plan. All in all, if you have the money to spend and/or want the convenience of everything in one place, this app could be for you. But for someone who is genuinely interested in learning about more about myself and how my brain works, I‚Äôll be looking for other options."
4,Gumbymac,"There are several glitches in the app. I will mention two. The first is the number of days you playing a row. I play every day but it starts my streak over constantly. This is a little irritating. The second is the words crossword game, which has a major glitch. You can find a word but it doesn‚Äôt enter the word until you find all the other words, then it magically pops in. This is irritating because there is no way to tell when it is going to happen and which word you already had right until you guess all the other words. This didn‚Äôt happen at first but now that I have played this game a lot it happens more games than it doesn‚Äôt.   Also, the comparison of how you do against others seems like it is a random number picked by them and not based on a true algorithm."
5,NoahMGry,"I can‚Äôt attest to the legitimacy of the IQ test or to the accuracy of the metrics that are supposedly being improved but I can speak on the entertainment value. It is very fun being able to play these logic puzzles daily and there is a clear polished feel to it all which for some might justify a subscription to the premium. To be clear: this product is technically free and you are given a good amount of games/tests but you also have the option of paying for the premium service with which you can become as smart as Einstein probably. Overall, perhaps I am a skeptic but I believe the primary way we should view this is as an entertaining app where you can complete daily logic puzzles and not as brain food. Great app though so it gets a 5* review from me."
3,abby.?,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a day or two now. I like it, i like the concept but i feel like the app is pretty close to unusable due to all the ads. I feel like every time i click something or finish part of a game i‚Äôm hit with another ad. I don‚Äôt want to pay a fee to remove the ads, because over time paying for all of my apps subscriptions and removing ads, adds up lol. I would be more inclined to use this app if there were a tad less ads. I also feel like premium is a little problem. I did a test, and it said i needed premium to get my score. i wasted my time doing it with no warning i wouldn‚Äôt get anything from it? on top of that, most of the games you need premium to play. I just wish that you get a little bit more of the app without premium. it‚Äôs not a big deal though, i think the biggest issue is the excessive ads though."
1,Moonlighting86,"I signed up for the three day free trial, read the terms that you need to cancel 24 hours before the trial ends, and then found there was nowhere within the app or the App Store where I could cancel.  I contacted Apple support as the developers have suggested in previous negative reviews - Apple says they have no record of a subscription and therefore cannot cancel it. This makes me think that I will be charged once my trial has ended and the developers are running some kind of scam.  I have never seen an app where there is no ability to cancel before your trial ends.  I have emailed the company as well, but I‚Äôm not expecting that they will get back to me.  If this charge goes through I will be contacting my credit card company to fight the charge.  This is ridiculous.  I spent an hour chatting with Apple and they‚Äôve had to escalate it to a phone call because they couldn‚Äôt help me.  How can this company tell you to go to Apple to cancel your trial, but Apple has no record it of?"
5,Great for the brain,"This far(on a free version) I find this well structured, each game tells you what part of the skill you are working on, which is so valuable . Knowing and reading what part this does is actually reiteration for the brain to do just that . I do wish yall would create an image of the brain and highlight what area it‚Äôs working and the games you create should also be linked to various aspects of the brain so ppl have a better idea on what area they are strong in vs need improvements in. If there is a way to add a colored version of the brain showing which game targets what and naming that part of the brain, this will enhance your app.  Well done, it‚Äôs fun but also a great way to exercise your brain during any breaks you take ‚Ä¶ be it from work or studying‚Ä¶"
2,Fearedfablest,"This was my favorite app for a very long time, and one I‚Äôd convinced dozens of others to try did to the variety of options and features of games within. It truly does (did?) have something for everyone and quickly became the game that replaced all of my other apps. However, each time there is an update something new breaks‚Ä¶ and each subsequent update that arrives to ‚Äòfix‚Äô things seems to break something else. Its infuriating because this app truly became the top app for so many people for quick games and over more strategically soothing games, but after the last 2-3 updates I just can‚Äôt recommend it anymore. Developers - spend more time QC‚Äôing your product before release, you are already in a densely saturated market space and you have to know that once a consumer starts searching for other similar games on the App Store you‚Äôve already lost them."
5,Cyrusun,"Fun and lots of games that keep my brain a little sharper. I liked the IQ test, it was pretty fun and challenging. The personality test was okay but I didn‚Äôt really like the fact that it made you choose between only two options per question when some of the words or concepts are definitely situationally more complex than to just choose between the two extremes.. but I get the point and of course as it says it isn‚Äôt an administered test so I didn‚Äôt take it too seriously. But the games are great and I feel like they help get me in a sharp mood.. if you get an offer to buy the yearly package for like 16 bucks, it seems like a good deal considering a lot of the games might have their own app with advertisements and you of course get more than that with this app.."
3,kenn357,"I got this app a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve enjoyed it quite a bit but I‚Äôve found that there‚Äôs some issues with the app, at least on my end. I didn‚Äôt pay attention and ended up deleting the app and when I redownloaded, I had lost all my progress. I tried to see if I could get back my data but couldn‚Äôt. My fault, it‚Äôs cool, I get it. I tried to start again and see if I could maybe make an account to try and save progress should something like this happen again, but I‚Äôm not able to create an impulse account. I‚Äôve tried creating one on the app but it won‚Äôt let me, mainly because when I click that I don‚Äôt have a web account, it just takes me back to the app settings. I tried going on the web to see if I could make an account there and I wasn‚Äôt able to. The app is neat, but stuff like this is a serious turn off :/"
3,Dec78294,"I downloaded this app and really enjoyed it so I went to purchase the premium membership. When I click ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù the page shows a loading circle then after several minutes the circle goes away but I do not proceed to the next page to submit payment. I have tried to restart my phone, clear more space, update my settings, delete and re-download the app. Nothing works. It seems I must continue to use the ad based version of the app. I tried to contact the developer support team but no one has gotten back to me and the message on their website will not submit either. There also seems to be a way to create a login on a webpage however I cannot locate that webpage to try that way. Anyway, the games are beneficial and the tests interesting. I will continue using the free version."
5,whomahwhatsit,"I don‚Äôt play many Mobile games, but I like this one, just a few minutes of game play to train the brain, simple math problems part is I think a really good one to help keep you sharp especially if you have a job that constantly has you doing math problems like dealing with money or measurements. Another one I thought I‚Äôd be better at is the arrow game, I was mistaken üòÖ swipe the direction of the white arrow, no problem, swipe the opposite direction for the yellow arrows, no problem super easy, let‚Äôs just say I was a little overly confident especially when you start to speed up. Typical watch ads to play for free. Subscription for no ads or one time purchase. I‚Äôm probably gonna one time purchase once I get tired of dealing with the ads."
3,Paige2117,"I paid the yearly subscription, and am reconsidering after this recent update. Would love if there could be a future update that reverts the Candy Sort game back to the way it was. The new feature that automatically moves all colors in one tube to another tube is very frustrating, and ruining a lot of fun within the game. Also the power-up feature where you could add a whole new tube, has changed to where the extra tube only allows for two color balls to go inside it before sending an error message that the tube is full. Before the update, the extra tube allows you to add four balls, which usually allowed for much easier handling of the remaining unfinished stacks. I updated the app after long avoidance, and am disappointed. Wish I continued pressing ‚ÄúSkip This Version‚Äù."
5,Dynomite üß®,"I like this app so far! The idea that I can sharpen my ability is great.. I‚Äôm an older woman, I‚Äôve been out of school for a minute and even though I‚Äôm not interested in going back, I still enjoy learning new skills and retaining the knowledge so I can pass it on! The tests are interesting too. I‚Äôve been wondering if I have adhd which is something that has gotten worse as I got older, it turns out there‚Äôs two types and I have a combination of both.. I‚Äôm glad to know, however it‚Äôs still a frustration in my life until I get it addressed. This app is beneficial for adults and children alike. The games are fun to play. Some more than others. I haven‚Äôt experienced any problems with the app so far but I‚Äôll update if anything changes."
5,dont fall for the adds,"So I got this app a couple days ago and I really love it! A month ago I had made it my mission to make get stronger mentally, I did some research and found out that learning a new language is great for your mental health so I decided to download a app (Doulingo) that could help me learn Russian. About a month in I realized that when I started a language lesson in the morning my head was just not ready. So I got this app to, I use this app before my language app in the mornings and it‚Äôs working wonders!!! I am learning Russian so much more easier and faster then I was before and this app helped me a lot! So thanks developers!!!!!!! And if you are considering getting this app then I suggest you do, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt just to try it out for a day!"
1,SnowboardMan333,"This was a great app and I loved using it, when there were no ads you had to deal with. I‚Äôve had this app for a long time, when I first got the app it  used to be free and had no ads. But it has become ridiculous having to watch and go through ads to do literally anything or have to pay to not deal with ads. I loved this app when I could choose what I‚Äôd like to do without waiting for ads or paying. Now you have to wait longer for ads to finish than to actually play or do whatever you‚Äôre wanting on the app. I no longer like this app and am deleting it, it‚Äôs not with the time and effort to have when the majority of the time you have to wait to do anything. I hope an actual person will see this and not AI and have the sense to realize how idiotic this as gotten, and maybe decide to change it. I hate this app for giving in to being a billboard for other apps that do the exact same thing."
2,courtney<33,"Engaging and fun app but pay attention to which subscription you‚Äôre paying! You may pay anywhere from $9.99/week ($520/year!) to $9.99/month ($120/year) to $40/year for the exact same ImpulsePRO plan. I understand there is a difference in price with time commitment but that‚Äôs crazy. Also, when I went to manage my subscription in iPhone settings, I saw about 20 versions of the same package all with crazy price differences from $4.99 to $9.99 per week and I could pick whichever I wanted from that screen. Hope the team reads this and cleans up their public facing price book and also considers being more transparent with their customers about setting the right price for the value of the product, instead of hoping their users will pay $9.99/week if they don‚Äôt take the time to dig into the fact that they could pay $4.99 just by canceling and renewing."
5,Wordyme,"I had Covid multiple times and the brain fog was seriously debilitating. I was forgetful, unfocused and lacked acuity in ways that were unsettling. I began using the impulse app as a tool and initially it was challenging. I enjoyed that I was only achieving for myself, no competition with others. I‚Äôve been using it for almost two years now and I feel like I‚Äôve regained my brain back. I even fine tuned some math skills that maybe weren‚Äôt as sharp even before Covid. I love this App! There are games for every interest and I even play them when I cannot sleep and they are actually relaxing. I have recommended this app to my aging parents, my peers and friends of all ages simply because it‚Äôs become such an asset for me. I hope you enjoy it!"
5,Vicki 3835,"With the many different test I have learned a lot about myself already. Things are spelled out, they are very easy to understand and you‚Äôre like‚Ä¶wow that‚Äôs right on the money but I didn‚Äôt realize this or this. There are suggestions on how to improve your mood, communication with others, your life in so many ways. It‚Äôs just amazing. And as we age we need brain games to help keep us motivated & moving forward at a great & steady pace, this app does that. The game‚Äôs challenges you in all areas of your brain & helps you to push yourself further all while telling you how you performed against your peers. I suggest this app to everyone. It is really, really worth your time & a great investment in yourself!!"
1,npursell,"I was extremely interested in this app based on the reviews. However, I was also extremely disappointed. I wanted to try the trial version before committing to purchase. I didn‚Äôt make it past three days before I was fed up with it. For the free trial app, you have to watch an ad before each game. That is understandable and I have no problem with that. However, when you click the ‚Äúwatch ad‚Äù button, the app just brings up a spinning load icon without going to the ad. It will do this three or four times before actually taking you to an ad. More than once, I had to just completely close the app and start again. It did the same thing. It is almost like they are trying to make it so annoying they force you to purchase the upgrade. They have definitely lost a customer here. Before you ask, no I do not have WiFi or service issues. Every single other app on my phone works flawlessly and without interruption. This is definitely on Impulse‚Äôs end and it is very sad."
5,mika 273878,"I struggle with forgetting things a lot due to having fibromyalgia and something that comes with that is forgetfulness and concentration.  I downloaded this app because it was starting to become embarrassing how much I would lose things and just simply forget little tedious details to my daily life. Although, since I have been using impulse I‚Äôve actually noticed a huge improvement, and the people around me have also. I‚Äôm only 24 years old so this is a big deal for being my age. Also, this isn‚Äôt one of those reviews to get some extra ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù like other apps do, I legitimately have noticed this app helping me. So if your reading this review, I would definitely download it."
5,guythatlovestoreview,"Upon thorough reflection, I find myself compelled to bestow a rating of five stars on this particular offering, chiefly due to the profound affection I harbor for its intricate elements. The array of engaging games is a testament to the sophisticated design and intellectual stimulation provided, presenting challenges of considerable complexity. It is precisely the presence of such demanding elements that amplifies the overall enjoyment, transforming what could have been a mundane experience into an exhilarating journey of mental agility. Were these games to lack such depth and rigor, the experience would undoubtedly be rendered monotonous and devoid of any substantial intellectual enrichment. Thus, it is with unreserved enthusiasm that I affirm a perfect score of 10 out of 10, reflecting the exceptional caliber and enriching potential of this captivating oeuvre."
1,Bombdelicious,"Oh, I like this what I got to do with it except they tricked me into thinking I was going to get a three day trial. Which I signed up for because I didn‚Äôt have the money in my account to subscribe yet as I was playing, they offered me a discount of 92% off for a year by subscribing and it‚Äôs starting today which I wanted the 90% off for the year but I didn‚Äôt have the money in my account today so now my game has stopped on me and I‚Äôm not getting the three day trial. Like I was supposed to get because I was tricked into believing I would get it. Buy an offer you couldn‚Äôt refuse. They try to trick your brain. Lol but not funny so so much for this game I will be deleting it! Well I realized they gave me the game but the whole time I had no idea til now and it‚Äôs over may 18th so I missed the whole time I could of been using the  app so I like it so far but I only have it for 18 more days and I just started playing it what a bummer! It‚Äôs seems like a great app"
5,AmyNAlabama,"I love love love these brain teasing games so much it‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôm actually strengthening my brain at the same time!!! This app loaded full of helpful but FUN games that help strengthen your memory, focus, problem solving tactics, etc and that‚Äôs just to name a few.. but there‚Äôs so much more to these exciting impulse games and you will not regret giving it a try bc I promise you will not want to stop after your personalized test / games are active.  Even allows you to get notifications in case you forget which this app will help with everyday‚Ä¶  i promise you will never believe your actually helping your brain while having fun!!!  What have you got to lose??? Oh yeah.. your mind! ü§Ø"
5,AOT_TYTY,I‚Äôve only used the app for a couple hours now and the way it challenges your brain is superb and it only gets more challenging the better you get while still being enjoyable. In this modern day and age where people have become so distracted and can‚Äôt focus on anything that does stimulate pleasure and enjoyment for more than a few seconds before they swipe up to the next reel this app is really a good refresher. I purchased the one time payment because I‚Äôm my opinion I believe it‚Äôs completely worth it and training my mind in this modern age will help me and everyone else who also made the purchase have an advantage in todays society. Highly recommend this app and I‚Äôll be using it everyday!!!!!
5,Nyxphoenix,"Been playing for two days and so far I really enjoy the exercises . I love puzzles and games that challenge my wit and strategy . Helps to unwind and relax my mind or stimulate and inspire in a positive and beneficial way. It has features also to tailor to the intensity of what you are going for mood wise . I don‚Äôt like games that unnecessary stress me out , but I do appreciate a challenge that motivates my focus and observation as well as creativity. It serves it purpose, so far so good . I recommend it. I enjoy finding patterns, connections and visual /spatial aspects as well as language and reading comprehension. Looking forward to the math exercises since I know I could really use the practice and encouragement to strengthen those skills."
5,AsymmetricalAsexual,"My mother and I have both downloaded this app and it is phenomenal. You can take tests to see your ADHD type, trauma response type, etc. Unfortunately, the plans to help with gaining further insight in those areas are blocked unless you pay money, but everything else is available! Totally worth it. It has helped with my anxiety and procrastination, and it makes me mad that people are angry that the app charges ""so small an amount of money"" Like, what??? You want them to charge more???? If you don't want to pay for therapy, you can't complain about paying for an app that helped me more than any therapist I had did. Very good app. Definately recommending to everyone, especially w/ ADHD or even Autism. SO GOOD!"
5,AnitaMinet,"Who do I call or speak to about an unintentional charge? Before canceling my subscription today, ‚ÄúRestore Purchases‚Äù was pressed and I received a pop up saying I purchased the lifetime upgrade, which I don‚Äôt want at all! I made sure to go into the App Store to cancel the subscription immediately after. I want to make sure I wasn‚Äôt charged almost $40 for a game!  That being said, I enjoyed playing this game. As I‚Äôve grown, so has technology, so anything before high-tech computers and phones seems primitive. I can honestly say I still enjoy reading paper back books, but any old techniques for challenging my brain are so outdated now. Good game filled with good puzzles. If I could afford it, I‚Äôd love it even more."
5,allibraswell,"i haven‚Äôt played a game on an app since candy crush came out, but when i discovered this when scrolling on the app store out of curiosity i was intrigued. i‚Äôm 26 with an average intelligence (in my personal opinion anyway). after a 1.5 year hypomanic episode ended due to developing mono from overworking/burnout, a year long depression followed. ive always been spacey but it worsened tremendously to the point i couldn‚Äôt develop coherent sentences when my health crashed. additionally, it‚Äôs hard to keep my attention and interest with pretty much anything, but this game has captured both. it‚Äôs validated i still have potential and my brain isn‚Äôt complete mush forever. ive always been insecure about my intelligence and brain functionality, but i thoroughly enjoy playing these games because they make me feel intelligent while being challenged. i also refuse to pay for apps except for a music subscription but this is another exception to the rule. i highly recommend this app and the subscription! it has helped my confidence grow, my brain elevate, and gives me hope for my future self‚Äôs mental state!"
4,GirlyGojo,"I personally think this game is really fun and challenging! I would give this a 4.5 if I could. I like how you can keep track and have daily workouts. A suggestion is to maybe see like half of you report after a test for free instead of just barely showing partial of the test. However the tests have fun questions to answer. I don‚Äôt know for sure if they‚Äôre right or not but I know that the tests are just fun to take and to just see the final result. I also like how it says on the games what it works on so that you can work on your mental goals more easily. The ad rate isn‚Äôt that bad I think, it‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs not horrible. Overall it‚Äôs just an amazing game that can help you reach your mental goals, unwind to relax, and just have fun!"
5,dan the arborist,"I‚Äôve been living with anxiety and depression since I was 18 (mid 50‚Äôs now), and recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I‚Äôve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.    The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.  The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I‚Äôm fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.    Highly recommend the app, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing increased results as I progress."
5,sbhuihdd,"I love this app. I don‚Äôt normally pay for apps, but this one felt like it had everything I had been looking for all in one place so I immediately bought the lifelong package. Once I started using the app, I didn‚Äôt regret it. I love the games and how they‚Äôre organized so you can either challenge yourself or choose one that is a little more mindless and relaxing. Furthermore, the tests. I am obsessed with learning about my brain and mental healthy, psychology etc. tests like IQ tests, or specific areas about your current wellbeing. I‚Äôm only a few days in, but I don‚Äôt see myself turning on this app any time soon. I really do love it and think I will continue to use it."
1,üåª‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®,"I have a few things to say... I downloaded this app as I wanted to excessive my brain and knowledge, keep in mind I am still a minor so I use a family account... This scammed me and my family, as even if you delete the app it still charges you until you remove it from your subscription (I deleted it before the trial ended)  we did not realize till a month after! So now even after we removed it it still wants us to make the final purchase, this money could have gone to so much better, it could have gone to family time or donations but instead it goes to scammers like them! There is a rainforest burning and and kids dying of hunger...and instead of people who are privileged to even own a phone shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for something as useless as dumb brain activity...that you could probably do online for free! If I could rate this app I seriously would and I despise talking about things this way but I honestly hate this app! If I could give it a 0 I would..."
5,sbfumfrlpdidjd,I am so happy the developer responses to our comments for good and bad feedback! THAT IS A DEVELOPER that is serious and CARES!!!! I wrote a review Friday with the same title and got a response today not even a week later!!!! That‚Äôs truly amazing! I am so so happy I subscribed to this game yearly!!! Between elevate and impulse (impulse has way more options than Elevate) not gonna lie I play both of these everyday I spend more time on impulse than just the daily training! I absolutely love this and for the developer to give us an email for any suggestions changes etc THAT IS A COMPANY THAT CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! So I can only imagine their care for their employees as well i am so PROUD to be a member of this brain training!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!
1,corendurance,"I bought the premium access version of this app several months ago, and was enjoying it daily (was at level 600+ on candy sort).  Then suddenly the app began getting buggy - 15-second delays, blank panels, etc. I sent a message to customer support but apparently it‚Äôs only for one-way feedback. Never got a reply.   As a last resort I deleted the app from my phone & reinstalled, but now all my data is lost and it‚Äôs starting me from the beginning! The only way to check your account is if you originally set it up online. Since I purchased through the Apple App Store I have no login, and it doesn‚Äôt recognize my Apple ID email!   If I get some help with this I‚Äôll upgrade this review, but right now I‚Äôm saying DO NOT BUY IT! From my experience the app & it‚Äôs UX were not thoroughly tested before selling it, and no one is in charge of building updates or responding to customers."
5,WhiteBoyCarl69,"Since March of last year I was extremely depressed and lost in what I was doing with my life, I‚Äôve tried other therapy methods and apps but none prevailed and when I first saw Impulse being advertised I didn‚Äôt believe it (mainly on how they delivered the pitch) at first but I downloaded it.. took a couple test and every single test made sense and was 100% accurate and honestly.. I feel happier.. better.. I feel like I have energy again and I no longer have to force a smile.. I ask myself what would‚Äôve happened if I never found the help in this app.. I can tell you it wouldn‚Äôt be anything so right now I‚Äôm just thankful to have a self checkup everyday to make sure I‚Äôm ok"
1,SkyRay93,"Signed up for 3 day free trial ‚Äúunlimited pro membership‚Äù, after which app costs $7 a week to use.  Launched the app, immediately got a pop up giving me a ‚Äúone-time offer only available on this screen 92% off for the year!‚Äù for a $29/year membership, which would cancel out my free trial period. Wanting to get the opportunity to try the app first, I declined.  Went to take my first test, the advertised ‚Äúchildhood trauma‚Äù test on TikTok.   First, I want to note it was not the test advertised. On TikTok it‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúinterpret the picture‚Äù tests, in reality it is a ‚Äúselect from most likely to least likely on each of 40 questions‚Äù.   Second, when I got to the end of the 40 question test, I was not allowed to view my results without first paying $7 to start my weekly subscription now or $29 for the year - despite the fact that I was supposed to have an unlimited pro free trial, and the $29 was supposed to be some super deal that was only available once.  In short - they‚Äôre playing you with fake discounts and hiding behind the facade of a free trial just to throw pop ups and pay walls in your face. Anything they can do to work some money out of you. Deleted the app and canceled my trial less than 30 minutes after downloading and came straight here to write this review to warn others."
5,Jodi5868,"The games are quick and hold my interest. My short term memory issketchy. I frequently forget where I left my glasses. I‚Äôll go to get something from a room and  get distracted by something and forget to grab it when I leave the room.  So, the app allows you to choose how long you‚Äôd like to play.  I like puzzles so I find the games and the 5 or 10 minute sessions relaxing and engaging.    I just started playing and will edit my review if I find that it‚Äôs working for me.  I chose the trial membership.  I appreciate apps that allow you to try before subscribing. I am willing to pay for something if it works.  Very annoying to pay for an app that doesn‚Äôt live up to expectations."
5,THENETKA,"At first I was skeptical when I saw this Ad on Instagram but I told myself ‚Äúwhat do I got to lose? Just a little bit of space.‚Äù And ever since that moment I‚Äôve been having a blast and keeping up with my streaks.   The games aren‚Äôt that difficult when you first start and very easy to pick up, there‚Äôs also creative games you can play aside from the 3 brain training games a day.  There is a subscription you can acquire to unlock more features for the app but I can‚Äôt lie, the free version is just as good as the paid! I do see myself acquiring a subscription in the future! Looking for something to keep that brain active in a world of mush definitely give impulse a go!"
5,magillicus,"I‚Äôve only had it for 2-3 days, but it‚Äôs exactly the type app I was hoping for. I assume, as the app states, the games will continue to increase in difficulty as I progress. Even the initial games have an appropriate difficulty level, though. I also like that I get notifications during the day to play more‚Ä¶which, oddly enough, only seem to show up when I‚Äôm idle. Each game details its focuses before you begin, which the app determines based on the preferences you set when you sign up. I generally don‚Äôt have large amounts of time to dedicate to entertainment-based apps (outside of fantasy football), but this self-improvement app is one I look forward to opening each morning."
2,mysterioso7,"So I decided to give this app a try, and I love the variety of games and tests it has.   However, the ads are far too frequent to the point where the app is having the opposite effect to what it should.   I was trying to play the Draw One Line game, which I greatly enjoy. However, I kid you not, I‚Äôm getting an ad after every. single. level. At first it was every other level, but now it is every level - including one before I‚Äôm allowed to play my first level after opening the app. This is not an exaggeration. Some levels take me only a few seconds to complete, which means I‚Äôm getting barely any time to actually play the game between ads. I‚Äôm spending about three times as long watching ads as I am playing the game.   This completely defeats the purpose of the app. How am I supposed to develop focus when I‚Äôm constantly pulled out of what I‚Äôm doing? The ad frequency is, quite frankly, worse than any game I‚Äôve played, and that‚Äôs saying a lot.   I would enjoy it much more if the ad frequency was toned down. I have no problem with the ads existing at a less intrusive level. But as of now, I don‚Äôt even want to open the app because I know I‚Äôll barely be able to play without getting interrupted."
4,Skim8,"It‚Äôs good for what it is. I paid $15 for a 1 year subscription because the ads were non-stop. I enjoy most of the games/puzzles, but there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement.   Once you move up a level in any puzzle, you can‚Äôt play the lower level anymore. When you get to level 10, you can‚Äôt do much more with it and it becomes boring. Some of my favorite games are impossible for me on level 10, so now I can‚Äôt really play them at all.   I wish they would add new puzzles. I‚Äôve canceled my subscription, so it won‚Äôt renew, but I would have kept it if they made just a few simple changes. When you look at what you actually get for the price, it wasn‚Äôt worth it for me. There are better options available for the price."
5,northside ella,"This app is awesome to help keep you on top of things. Some people and up laying back watching videos all day and that doesn‚Äôt work your brain. I actually had to think in these Little games, I had to do math, I actually had to remember where things were in place, and I had to match items that. It may seem like and the games are games that we played when we were younger, but in all actuality when we were younger they were meant to help stimulate our brain and make it work at a point to. So if you think you‚Äôre slipping a little bit maybe forgetting too much or things to start coming to you fast enough give it a try and see if it works for you it‚Äôs working for me"
5,yvngvlone,When I play these brain games I focus better than I normally would. I think that stems from the fact that it‚Äôs right on my phone. Normally I would find my self anxiously checking my phone throughout the day not really focusing on anything for too long. But now whenever I feel bored or restless I‚Äôll open up the Impulse app and I‚Äôm able to just tune in and get some good metal workouts going while having the comfort of being right on my phone. Because let‚Äôs face it. Our phones are an extension of who we are now. So being able to use our phones to strengthen our brain is honestly the biggest benefit of this app. I‚Äôm no longer scrolling endlessly. Restlessly. Relentlessly.
4,Blonki13,"I really like this app as it tracks your progress over time. For many (not all) of the games, there‚Äôs an area when you select a game to begin that tells you where you are and how to progress to the next level and even a comparison to how well you did against your peers. All great. For the most part I like to play the word games, however there‚Äôs one game, Words Ninja, where I repeatedly get 100% and I don‚Äôt know how to progress. I feel pretty fast but I have no idea where I‚Äôm at or how to get better. Theres no stats like I described above for the other games on this one. I really wish the dev could update this because I‚Äôm consistently getting 100% and my highest score is only at 1862. Please fix this."
4,Musibird,Great news!!!! So when I first discovered this I seen that you could pay monthly yearly or one time payment I was just going to do the 3 day trial but then the app decided to give me a discount opportunity. I think it was 20% off 50% off or 92% off. It was three gift boxes and they mixed up after showing you what was in it and then you could choose. I was lucky enough to get to 92% off. It‚Äôs yearly tho but it‚Äôs cool!!  I love this app I‚Äôve had it for 2 days but still I love it! I have not ran into any complications so far and that is good! The only issue is I don‚Äôt like the way it compares you to others it‚Äôs ok I guess but for someone who has had trouble with inferior feelings I feel it might discourage them if they were to get a lower percentage
5,Jade‚ù§Ô∏è‚ôèÔ∏è,"When I had first started it I had thought that it was going to be awful. When I had started everything, I was happy because I could do a lot of things even without paying for anything. As a person who doesn‚Äôt have a job and is under the age of 18. I love this app. When I‚Äôm bored in class or need a mental update I go to this app. I‚Äôm a high school student so being able to be quiet in a class with ADHD and taking a test is super hard. I‚Äôm able to have my phone when I‚Äôm taking certain test but a teacher or administrator is with me just to make sure I don‚Äôt cheat. I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 days and I‚Äôm already seeing good things come out of this."
5,novaliseeeeeeeeezzzzzzcedezzzz,"It‚Äôs a nice game it definitely keeps your mind sharp and tests your focus the only downfall is they try to sell every little level up and continue to after you decline. I mean after it‚Äôs declined it should not be pushed on you the way it is. once in a while cool but it‚Äôs too frequent. A lot of games have it where you can play without purchase and make in app purchases if you choose. Again this one has that but it seems it‚Äôs there just to pressure you to buying more. Over all what it‚Äôs intended for is good fun and a challenging game, WITHOUT the purchases!! So five star for its design and reason for design but 3-4 stars for profit intentions and aggravation from pressing the issue  honestly‚Ä¶."
1,AngelaAretz,"The games are fun and the app is well-made but after my trial version expired, I discovered that I‚Äôm paying 8 dollars PER WEEK (and that‚Äôs with a 30% discount) and there is no easy way to end your subscription on the iPhone application. The company makes it all too easy to sign up and intentionally difficult to cancel your subscription. In the meantime, you‚Äôre paying 28 bucks a month‚Äî which if you keep it, ends up being almost 340 dollars per year! I‚Äôve used many brain trainings apps and none were even close to being this outrageously expensive! Even intensely involved video games (with very advanced graphics and complicated storylines) don‚Äôt cost even a tenth of this to own for life! I‚Äôm truly appalled at how much they‚Äôre charging and disgusted by their use of ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù to lure people into paying an exorbitant amount for something that isn‚Äôt even worth a fraction of what they charge.   Would NOT recommend, unless you have disposable income."
1,queenprey,So first off I had totally forgot I had this app in 2022 and I did the free trial period. I recently downloaded it again and it gave me the option to do the free trial so that‚Äôs what I did. I always make sure to cancel before it has me fully subscribe just incase I‚Äôm no longer interested in the app. I noticed that I couldn‚Äôt download anything because there was an unpaid amount on my account which happened to be from impulse. Impulse never notified me that they were going to charge me the full amount instead of giving me the free trial. (It allowed me to select free trial when I downloaded the app) so that really threw me off when I see a charge I wasn‚Äôt expected considering it was only suppose to be a free trial‚Ä¶ now I can‚Äôt download anything until the charge is paid which I think is unfair to me as a customer because impulse should have communicated that with me from the start.
5,Jenn.M.Campbell,"I absolutely loving Impulse! This brain training app has been a game-changer for me. After just two days of use, I feel like I've leveled up my mental agility! The games are engaging, challenging, and so much fun to play. I've noticed a significant improvement in my cognitive abilities, and I feel sharper, wittier, and quicker on my feet.  The variety of exercises and puzzles keeps me entertained and motivated to continue learning. Impulse has genuinely enhanced my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence. I'm hooked!  If you're looking to upgrade your brainpower and have a blast while doing it, look no further than Impulse. Five stars isn't enough - I'd give it ten stars if I could!"
1,backcountryfishnerd,"They way they designed the games really centers around focus and that‚Äôs nice and the games are fun and I actually enjoy being forcibly disengaged from my life via notification to play a game. However, they hit you with a price that is so high that you might as well purchase a console or handheld. But then, they hit you with 90-96% off and that is super shady. How are you going to offer people a price that relies on how willing they are to leave the app? Just make an honest price for the game. The notifications for the discounts and subscriptions are so irritating that I didn‚Äôt even want to run the trial. On top of it all, you can‚Äôt access the report things if you aren‚Äôt subscribing but you can take the test. Such a bait move. If you are more focused about tricking people into paying money than you are about the game and development of it, you are doing the wrong thing (or we are)."
3,Mayor MacDonough,"It‚Äôs not the most engaging, but it certainly does keep mental acuity sharp as promised. It‚Äôs greatly lacking in diversity among minigames however, and its quizzes and tests are spotty at best. Even still, I would recommend this for someone who wants to casually remind themselves about basic math or problem solving skills, or for educating younger audiences about simple mental tasks. The app becomes less useful for adults who wish to use it as a learning tool though, and its effect at preserving more complex mental abilities appears to be limited by the low minigame diversity. All in all, excellent tool for younger audiences and anyone struggling with maintaining their basic mental capabilities, but an adult looking to develop new skills would find better success searching for alternative resources."
5,Nikki (NeNe),"The reason I like impulse training is because it makes you think quick on your feet, makes your heart beat faster because it makes you get excited because your racing against the clock and trying to beat it without missing any. It‚Äôs also exciting because you want to be quick and get it right and as quick as you can but you don‚Äôt know if you can. So it‚Äôs like your trying to prove to yourself you can do it and at the same time not let yourself down. Then when you do beat the clock and you score good on each game; at the end your happy and it was satisfying!! Like a pat on your back to yourself, good job so to speak!"
5,SE√òN,So earlier today I was going through a deep in look inside my head and drowning in my own thoughts just scrolling through and came upon this app..now seeing things on TikTok I usually brush it off but I‚Äôll say giving this app a try and a chance in a desperate point walker I‚Äôve got to say from the moment using this app in the short span ..it‚Äôs made me feel happier with its nice sounds it has for you winning to the bubbly noises of clicking other items ..the whole theme is very comforting and maybe could be a bit more if given the opportunity of it it could be something so much more ..please give this app a try you won‚Äôt regret it ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Awesome Game!!! :D :D,"My father got me the app, Impulse to train my brain. At first, I was pretty confused why he gave us that app. I‚Äôve been playing it since though and it really my brain out. I loved the app! The way things were designed, the challenges, the brain-twisting, the fun‚Ä¶ I loved it.   Now, I am a Middle School beginner and I forgot about the game six months ago and randomly stopped playing it. I saw my brother playing it and I asked why he‚Äôs on his phone. He told me he‚Äôs plying Impulse so I remembered‚Ä¶ and I downloaded the game on my phone. It got better from six or ten months ago! Especially how challenging things are. I think the creators and developers have done an awesome job on this game!"
5,AppEdd10,"When getting an app that you hope will improve your quality of life and help you spend better time on your phone you want it to last without having to pay several dollars a month. This lifetime subscription is affordable and comes with everything I wanted and more. I wanted challenging and fun games. This app has that. I wanted daily notifications and a streak counter to hold me accountable. This app has that. The added bonus of self-improvement resources, IQ tests, and personality tests was something I didn‚Äôt know I wanted but you guessed it‚Ä¶ this app has it. Love the app, keep improving it and adding more challenge, you‚Äôve got a happy customer here. ü§ôüèΩ"
4,Tobias Flynn,"The candy stacking game is probably one of my absolute favorites in this app and I was ecstatic when it was announced that new levels were being released. This being said, some of the new levels aren‚Äôt being marked as completed even if I pass the level multiple times, particularly lvl 1516. Now I understand that sometimes a level will come up as grey even after passing it as a way of potentially solving it in a different way than previously but I‚Äôve completed this level (1516) at the very least 10-12 times and it still comes up as incomplete. Hopefully another update should fix that if it‚Äôs looked at~ otherwise this is one of my favorites apps :)"
2,xenotashin,"So, I mostly enjoyed my time with Impulse these last 38 days. However, because the information locked behind the premium version is your actual progress, you‚Äôre stuck seeing ‚Äòcomparison‚Äô ratings. This might be fine, but it feels awful when because you miss 1 ghost on the memory ghost game, even due to a misstap, it‚Äôll say you ‚ÄúYou did better than 0% of players, don‚Äôt feel bad this level is hard.‚Äù. Which not only comes off as condescending, but unfortunately apparently is something to feel bad about because apparently I did worse than literally everyone because I accidentally tapped one tile to the right.  I know, it‚Äôs a silly thing to gripe about, but that combined with how the game actively punishes you for last second guessing is just not fun. I hope it improves, but for now I‚Äôm done."
5,bfgerald,"I understand and embrace my ADHD combined type and how it has shaped my personality and daily functioning. I really like using this app because it makes me feel accomplished by presenting challenges that align with how my brain works. The informal testing and the results make me feel acknowledged and understood, without constantly having to explain myself to others or search for activities that suit my needs. It's all conveniently available in an app, and I can stop using it whenever I feel like I've gained what I need to get back to my daily life or when I need a little help focusing. It's definitely worth a try to see what works best for you."
1,IsaacH320,"So basically this is a $50 dollar app, you made a weekly subscription $7 and a yearly subscription $29, it‚Äôd be a waste to get either subscription and you know that is how people will think of it, predatory at best. If you choose to use it for free you‚Äôre going to be watching ads for roughly 35-50 percent of the time you‚Äôll be using the app, in some scenarios I would finish a game and have to watch an ad that lasted longer then the match did and that would happen back to back sometimes. If this app was a straight $10 (that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs worth let‚Äôs be real) I would have bought it. It‚Äôs a shame you guys chose these predatory marketing practices because the app is actually not bad otherwise but it surely isn‚Äôt worth $7 a week, $29 a year or $50 for a lifetime purchase. Also the app keeps freezing at the end of ads, I have to close the app and then watch another ad."
5,isa 8749,"My intentions when I first downloaded this app were to have something to do when I was bored, but something ""worthwhile."" Even though playing something on my phone isn't the best thing, I actually found myself being challenged mentally with this app. The games are in multiple categories, such as math, language, memory training, etc. Each game is unique and entertaining, while at the same time it really is training your brain. Throughout my time of using it, I've seen  improvement in simple everyday reflexes, or paying attention to what happens in my peripheral, as well as better memory."
3,JadeMurrSir,"I downloaded this app as a replacement for the mind numbing games filled with ads I was spending my free time playing, but now I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs much better. The games are engaging yes, however there is an ad before and after almost every game you play. I understand ads being in the app, but between every single game? It almost makes me not want to use it at all. I understand part of it is an incentive to get the subscription- but y‚Äôall I‚Äôm a broke college student, I don‚Äôt just get subscriptions casually (regardless of how cheap they are). Besides this the games are fun, they‚Äôre entertaining while also providing a little more brain work with each level. I‚Äôll see how I like it as time goes on, but for right now the ads are kind of ruining it for me."
1,everynicknameistaken369,You can‚Äôt access anything except the questionnaire on your personal demographics and interests. Right after that the app offers a free trial of three days with an auto subscription after that you must cancel 24 hours in advance.  I tried to click out of that and the app enrolled me instead. I tried a quiz just to see and I couldn‚Äôt even view my results without paying with either a subscription or one time fee. At one point a screen popped up and forced me to selected an prize offer. I couldn‚Äôt click out of the pop up until I did. Then it tried to charge me for a full year subscription with this ‚Äúfree offer‚Äù.  Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to cancel it and I have to go through the Apple ID settings but can‚Äôt find the selections that the app‚Äôs instructions gave me in my Apple ID profile.  Also had to really dig for those instructions.  This app is a scam.
5,javiera919,"Impulse is hands-down one of the best brain-training apps I‚Äôve used! It combines science-backed exercises with engaging, game-like challenges, making it fun and easy to stick to a daily routine. The variety of games covers memory, focus, problem-solving, and more, all designed to keep your mind sharp. Each session is short but impactful, perfect for fitting into a busy day. I also love the progress tracking and tailored exercises that adapt to my strengths and weaknesses, making it feel like a personalized experience. Impulse genuinely feels like it‚Äôs helping me stay mentally agile and focused. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to keep their brain active in a fun and effective way!"
5,D4vidplayz,"Impulse is an amazing app and I am here to explain why! 1. There is no shortage of games that help memory, thinking, and more! Theres even an IQ test! 2. There is always a daily training challenge that lets you experience multiple games at once, and gives you a quick challenge. 3. Its FUN. Sure ‚ÄúBrain Training‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like the funnest thing in the entire world, but with impulse you play games that give you mental benefits AND are just fun in general! I would say the only thing I dislike about this game is the ads. Yeah I know Most games have ads but this one seems like it wouldn‚Äôt, but they are pretty uncommon so it‚Äôs not much of a problem."
5,Lillith Flamingwolf,"It seems simple. It doesn‚Äôt take much time. It‚Äôs easy to understand. And I personally find it fun! Neuroplasticity is an imperative component to a healthy brain üß†. And like all muscles, it‚Äôs gets better, faster, stronger when it‚Äôs used. Numerous studies show that the brain can be rewired. Improved. And that using cognitive functions keeps both young and old engaged, builds confidence, and improves overall mental health.  This app is also affordable. If you have young children or elderly family, I highly recommend this app to keep them bright and sharp! Download and try it yourself! Let‚Äôs create a Smarter and  Brighter World! Be blessed, and don‚Äôt forget to excersize YOUR  HEAD!!"
5,Wbzine,"Engaging with a mind training application has proven instrumental in refining and augmenting my cognitive prowess. Through its meticulously designed exercises and tailored challenges, this app has become an indispensable tool in enhancing my mental acuity, bolstering my memory retention, and fostering sharper focus. The structured regimen provided by the app has not only optimized my problem-solving abilities but has also imbued me with a heightened sense of mindfulness, enabling me to approach tasks with greater clarity and efficacy. Furthermore, the app's adaptability to my individual progress ensures a dynamic and personalized learning experience, ultimately culminating in a discernible enhancement of my overall brain function."
5,AshBash325,"Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in my family on my maternal side and I‚Äôve found that as I age and near 40, regularly spending dedicated time working my brain muscles on activities unrelated to my personal life and/or work are what keep me feeling mentally strong and reduces the fear of developing dementia later.   Of course, there are also many benefits now, years before I have to be actively concerned about brain degeneration‚Äîimproved attention span, quicker processing, better memory. Impulse is great for those times you‚Äôd otherwise be mindlessly scrolling social media; the games are fun and the advantages are many. Highly recommended for those wanting to optimize their brain health!"
3,Angelface162891,"I‚Äôve been using it in my downtime rather than getting stuck in a scroll hole on ig. I‚Äôve seen lots of improvement and It‚Äôs really fun! However, recently I was in the middle of playing one of their mini games and I was notified that my account that I paid a year for had been deleted on another device. I do not own nor have I logged in on another device. All of my account history over the previous 3-4 months was deleted. I‚Äôm very confused and sad by this situation. I had taken almost all of the test and was making progress in all the games. I was enjoying seeing my improvement over the months. I‚Äôm hoping I can find a way to restore my account data but I‚Äôm having trouble finding a help line for the app. Very demotivating. :("
1,Bee Truthful,"Knowing that nobody reads the small print, they can‚Äôt stand behind their product enough to legitimately give a free trial period. You must decide at least 24 hours before your trial period expires to keep it free. If you decide and cancel on your third day they will charge you for whatever time period they have automatically set up. Everything is difficult to find. A trial period is supposed to be just that. If you only have 2 days to try and decide it is purposely misleading to call it a 3 day free trial. They knew this when they purposely set those rules so they could steal money from everyone willing to give them a try, but still try to legally protect themselves. Absolutely disgusting individuals! It‚Äôs not much money a month, but the principle boils my blood, especially with so many people really hurting financially right now in the extreme inflation of the economy."
4,Chico News and Review,"Fun stuff.. something to kinda look forward to. I couldn‚Äôt give it a 5 because I don‚Äôt know for certain if it‚Äôs actually helping my cognitive function on a day-to-day basis, and a lot of what I see is ripped off of Lumosity (which is another brain training app I used to use back when it first came out). Another reason I couldn‚Äôt leave it with 5 stars is because of the grammatical errors I keep randomly bumping into? They remind me of poorly written Chinese instructions, which now that I‚Äôm thinking about it is not a good thing to run into when you‚Äôre on an app that claims to help you engage and develop different parts of your brain‚Ä¶ BUT we‚Äôre all human, and nothing is perfect."
5,lisacroux,"I enjoy using Impulse because it‚Äôs different than all other ‚Äúbrain building‚Äù games out there. I personally love the information provided before each task, it explains which one of my goals will be met by completing the task. At the end I am also graded and my scores are compared to others my age, feeds into my competitive side and makes me want to train more üòÇ. There are a variety of game styles and trainings. The system used is easy to incorporate into anyone‚Äôs routine, I spend 5 minutes training everyday and find myself spending extra time playing mini games because it‚Äôs more rewarding than doom-scrolling."
5,KimMcDPT,"I downloaded thinking I‚Äôd try it because I‚Äôve been through several free apps with similar brain games. You really can‚Äôt even try it without subscribing. I kept hitting cancel or no payment plan and it kept taking me back to ‚Äúdouble click to subscribe‚Äù on my App Store page‚Ä¶.umm, no. Maybe a purposeful glitch so people get frustrated, can‚Äôt get off that page, and accidentally subscribe just to move on??? I shut down my App Store, deleted the app, and checked my subscriptions to be sure it didn‚Äôt sign itself up for me.  The app looks like it could be fun. But NOT for the price."
5,Qoebeth,"I love Impulse. I originally downloaded it because I‚Äôm getting older (63) and I felt like my memory and focus were slipping. Since I started playing the games my scores have gone up in all the categories and I‚Äôve noticed a difference in my ability to remember phone numbers and details at work, as well as a huge uptick in my ability to do math in my head. The variety of games and puzzles keeps things fresh and the tests are sometimes quite revealing. Definitely five stars. I do have a paid version, and it‚Äôs been worth every penny already. I‚Äôm trying to get my mom to get an iPhone so she can play too."
3,ssshhhh,"I have had the paid app for more than a month now. Overall, I enjoy the games but I have a few problems with the design.  First, I don‚Äôt feel like I am improving. The games get a little more complicated each day you play them, but if I didn‚Äôt do well today I feel a little discouraged the next time I see the game and it‚Äôs harder. I would like to ‚Äòwin‚Äô a couple times before I advance. Also, for some of the games you need to enter an answer but if you have crappy eye hand coordination like me and don‚Äôt hit the submit button squarely, you exit the game. I would love to see a single ‚Äòexit‚Äô button that is nowhere near any submit buttons to avoid this frustration!   Finally, please create a tablet version! I am an older adult who has a hard time seeing tiny yellow numbers on a white background or a white teapot on a white background, even with readers on its harder to see contrasts like I used to. Plus the eye hand coordination problem I mentioned makes hitting the right tiny button a bigger challenge than the puzzles!  Overall I enjoy the games, but I‚Äôm not sure if my brain is actually improving. ü´§"
3,diimo.,"It's a great brain app that strengthens your mind and can help you feel better. I personally liked it, but the bad thing is that there's so many ads. You can only go three levels on certain games without getting ads, and some only one. The price isn't very high for a year, but I just want to do something for free that helps my life. Putting so many ads in there along with an amazing app changed nothing, it more or less just left it the same. If you're willing to spend a little cash to get no ads and all that, then I would say this is an amazing app that provides you with pretty much everything, but if you don't want to spend it, then you're just gonna have to deal with all the ads and work arounds."
4,X0wolf0X,"I really think this app is great and a good way to understand yourself a bit more but as a child myself and other we can‚Äôt always pays for stuff just to see results, I feel like this is unfair and not a great way for people to want to use the app. I would like to be able to see my results so I know what to work on and what to do more research on, people have made it so you have to pay for everything just to use an app. Most people can‚Äôt afford stuff like that or their parents won‚Äôt let them because of the prices. I understand this is a way to get money from the app but there are better ways to do so."
4,bri maxwell,This is a great app to have in my opinion for me because i just  find the games calming but genuinely i hate the fact that almost EVERYTHING is premium. If i take the time out of my day to do one of these quizzes i expect results not just what it is and literally nothing else. If i want to play more than 8 games then i feel like i should because there is at least 30 games on there and just about only 8 are available that is just a little bit insane. And THE ADDS the adds just make me so angry even though this app is supposed to be calming. If im doing a word search i dont want an add halfway through . Other then these things it s a great app over all.
5,Isabelly hofman De Sozua,So cool and I really wanna play a lot of times and I hope this person that made this game do a lot of this versions and it looks so fun to play but it looks like it‚Äôs something for adults but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs for kids and every kind of age except except one through four can‚Äôt play this game because it‚Äôs really hard and I hope this person can all of this cause it looks really cool and yeah this game pretty much I gave it I will pretty much give it 100 cause stars because it is so cool and yeah I love it and I gave five because there wasn‚Äôt one 100 so yeah and I love this game and my mom has it and everybody. I hope that people love this game. ü©∑
1,mandy loves edward cullen,"It‚Äôs just another app that‚Äôs trying to get you to pay for a subscription. It seems like every single app these days is a subscription and I‚Äôm sure the games are really fun and it might help in the long run, but after having to fill out a five minute quiz to find out the only way you can play this game is by paying over $4.99 a month is ridiculous.   If I wanted to buy an app, I would just do that. Seriously, just tell people there‚Äôs a cost upfront. As soon as I found out there was a pay wall I immediately deleted the app. And frankly, I‚Äôm never gonna pay for this app out of spite. I would‚Äôve never downloaded it if I would‚Äôve known that there was a pay wall, and I guess that‚Äôs the point. Overall, it‚Äôs bad business and a bad business practice. If I could vote it 0 out of 5 stars I would. Save your time don‚Äôt download it."
5,HighlightedPencil,"This app is perfect, for a while I‚Äôve been questioning myself and my own iq. I trust this app as if it shows all my results. And makes me feel confident about my education. It‚Äôs super easy and there are so many fun educational games to stretch your head instead of those boring cross word puzzles. I suggest this app especially for ones who are interested into taking iq quizzes or seeing your growth in development.   There‚Äôs also hyped personality quizzes and more that you can learn about yourself to questions.   There are a lot of questions in most but short time. Which is how you know this app is advanced, to conclude download this app.. like now!"
5,ramoni666,"im 23, i have adhd and i smoke A LOT of marijuana so this app actually helps me a lot. even when im not consistent, i jump right where i left off. when im consistent, its even better bc i can keep a detailed track of my progress and even earn achievements. i bought the year membership the first week of using the app and i have zero regrets. i dont like notifications popping up on my phone so i have them all turned off, however i dont mind when impulse notifications pop up. its a reminder to exercise your brain. my favorite part about the app is the tests you can take to learn more about yourself."
3,Gayboydeluxe,"I genuinely just want to know what makes the developers think that what this app is offering is worth $28 a month. The games and exercises are good, but not particularly special. There is no lack of brain training websites available - the only thing special about this is its app format. I will say, the UI is very well done and easy to navigate, but seriously? $6.99 a WEEK? Does this truly deliver *more than double* the worth of something like netflix or curiosity that have huge libraries of content? I want the developers to get paid well for their work, but this feels excessive. If I continued paying for this for more than one week I'd feel like I got played for a fool, so I think I'll do my brain training elsewhere. Thanks anyways."
5,lunabrina,"I love this app, the games are fun and definitely exercise my brain. I use it everyday. Sometimes just for the puzzles or the relaxing games like candy sort. I just really need dark mode. I understand the games can‚Äôt be dark mode. But for any screens that are bright white, can you offer dark mode or night mode? Like the start screen or menu screens. I suffer from migraines and the bright light really bothers me, especially at night when I want to use the app to wind down for the day. Other than that, I love the app and will continue to be an active user and recommend to friends, thank you!"
2,ThiccXHarlet,"I got this app for the iq test the app it‚Äôs self is good if you want to spend $37 on it just  for games to test your skills, I did the free trial to do Just the iq test (something that should be free) I canceled my trial because I got in a work accident and am not getting a lot of medical leave check. And to be honest I didn‚Äôt want to keep the app anyways. Because I canceled my trial they are charging me $37 for no reason. It says they charge if you cancel on the 24hour mark but exactly 24hours before the trial ends it pays for the next subscription so You get like 2 hours to cancel or they will charge you. I don‚Äôt have money to pay for my broken foot let alone $37 for a game subscription cancellation fee. For that much money you should get the app for free until you feel you don‚Äôt need the app anymore. DONT GET THIS APP üò°"
2,maniac2xs,"No complaint as far as exercises & games, but that only goes so far when after every game you play &/or button you press either leads to  an add or them trying to upsell you on subscriptions. Usually when an app offers a free trial they won‚Äôt bother you until the trial ends; not impulse. The free trial doesn‚Äôt grant you access to anything, it‚Äôs as good as not subscribing at all. Once the trial ended & I decided to subscribe weekly, they had the audacity to upsell me again with a 39$ one time payment immediately after I paid 6$ for the week. I believe the upselling & adds are counterproductive to the apps purpose. It‚Äôs ironic that the app meant to help me focus is the same one distracting me. I understand adds & subscriptions fund development, but it‚Äôs never that serious‚Ä¶"
5,NANAPEEZY,"I accidentally came across this game and was regretting having to pay for it without a good sense of trial. However , this has changed my mind in a way. Whenever I need to refresh or reset or even calm down from overthinking , I do my daily exercise and I feel so much better. Example:- I attempted to declutter my room but it failed for months to a point I was sleeping on top of boxes. Used the game and I was ready to complete each task. 3 days after I found myself with a new looking home with less items and very much organized for the first time since I have been diagnosed with ADHD."
1,sayjoannA,"Day 1 no ads at all. They try to get you to upgrade to paid version which is fine/expected. I skipped it to see how I like the app before committing to that. Glad I did. Day 2 the ads start up. After the 1st minute long ad that I couldn‚Äôt skip a notification screen comes on and says ‚ÄòYou can skip ads after 5-15 seconds and they help fund further game development‚Äô. 5-15 seconds huh? Lies. There were 3 sections in todays game play. Before I could play section 1 there was a minute long ad, Section 1 game play lasted maybe 20 seconds, then another at least minute long ad.. at the 1 minute mark when the ad wasn‚Äôt finished yet I deleted the app. In the intro questions I said I wanted to braintrain for 10min a day.. at this rate that 10min will be 9min of ads and 1min of game play/brain training. This isn‚Äôt brain training this is clickbait."
5,ccrcmedic,I stumbled across this app while trying another as usual. Then I started with a couple questions and before I knew it I was hooked.  I have only had this app for <24 hours and half of those hours were playing!  I love the investigator/riddle mode! The scenarios ask a question and the answer is ‚ÄúFREE TEXT‚Äù and could be correct‚Ä¶ (Not sure if they read the answers and get back to me ‚Ä¶) I have PTSD and I try to find a method to ease my angst ‚Ä¶ the only thing that I don‚Äôt like is how expensive the app is for continued use (after 3-day trial)‚Ä¶ I know the App ‚ÄúHeadspace‚Äù gives an extended free use (1-Year) for people like me during a pandemic.
5,LilacMist04,"I was recently diagnosed with adhd and it is suspected I may also be on the autism spectrum.  I think my ONLY big complaint is that for the tests, many questions are too broad or too vague and it makes it difficult to answer. I think rewording or adding clarification would 100% help individuals, especially those who are neurodivergent, better understand how to answer as vague questions often confuse us or make us overthink something even if it‚Äôs meant to be simple. I think that another way to fix this is by instead of being 1-5 maybe have it be 1-7 or 1-10 for the strongly disagree to strongly agree scale. üòä"
5,OneLove317,"This is a great way to exercise our brains!  Also a great way to build good self esteem when you see your placement of % of your peers you did better than it‚Äôs almost like, I gotta give myself a pat on the back, it‚Äôs already taught me how to teach my kids their math homework, I wish I was taught that PEMDAS acronym for math order and I would‚Äôve done so much better, my worst subject is in math but it‚Äôs my children‚Äôs worst as well! So this has taught me some cool things about myself too. It‚Äôs nice that someone came up with a self motivated, self esteem lifting, attractive app! Thanks for the trial I think i may subscribe! Want the more difficult levels ! üòàü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂üèΩ"
5,Ndiacnocleer,"I‚Äôve been doing the brain training for a month or so and it was just kind of a thing I did to kill time in waiting rooms or to wind down at the end of the day. It tells you your progress but it‚Äôs easy to discard that kind of information. That is, until someone else saw me playing it and they commented on how fast I was able to complete the little games and how they could never have done that. Then, I realized how much progress I had already made. It doesn‚Äôt feel like work, they‚Äôre just games! But it exercises the parts of your brain that need worked! Love this! Thank you!"
5,App = Impulse,The app is  really good but my problem isnt the app its me i get almost all correct the only ones i got incorrect was the paper plastic sorting game and i think this can really improve you memory mental maths and more but most importantly i am 8 being able to get these puzzles right in pure seconds so this app right here i think will tell you if you are gifted or not depending on your age and skill on this great app and overall this app it's so good I give you a five star this app help you improve you're thinking skills and your brain will be able to calculate what is what in only a matter of seconds so thats why this app is a 5 STAR
5,Fradys,"You know what, I bought this a few months ago because I thought it would be good for me in the long term. Was I right? Heck yes. Even though I used to procrastinate doing it after seeing the little notifications each day, I‚Äôm starting to realize I actually enjoy doing it and I no longer see it as a task. The way they set up the games are enjoyable and I can already tell that they are helping me. I also like how there an IQ tests and self tests to help understand yourself greater. 5/5 star app as far as I am concerned. I think it‚Äôs healthy for the mind to do stuff like this. I recommend anyone to give it a shot!"
5,Grumpy Person üòíüòíüòí,"This game is awesome. However, I don‚Äôt thing paying for the game is necessary. This game is perfect for kids around 12-13, but accidentally paying for a game is not fun because anyone‚Äôs parents could get mad or something. Playing without paying is still really awesome. It‚Äôs not my decision to make you guys like not have that paying pop up thingy, but this game is still awesome. I forgot to mention at the beginning, but I would rate it a 5 and a half if I could because of the paying pop up thingy whatever. Overall, this game is a really fun one, and I wish you good luck continuing to create games/edit games :)"
5,kaylanye,"I played this game for the free trial because I looove brain workout games, but I never found one I cared for too much. As I played more and more, I enjoyed it more, and more. There is definitely so much to offer! This is by far the best brain app game I‚Äôve ever tried. I‚Äôll be 31 January 27‚Ä¶ I ended up forgetting to cancel after the trial. But I didn‚Äôt want to cancel just yet because it was THAT good.. I justified the lapse of the trial for a couple weeks because it‚Äôs my birthday lol. But I really do need to cancel because it‚Äôs too expensive sadly, unfortunatelyüòî If I wasn‚Äôt on a tight budget I would keep it for a while longer. ü§óüëäüëçüëçü´∂üèº"
5,yuhhhhboiii,"I have an attention deficit disorder so I generally get bored of apps very quickly. This is by far the best app I have purchased for the purpose of entertainment/ education/ mental training. Their are tons of different games which helps keep my attention and if I get bored of one type of game their is another I want to play. Also all the rewards and scores  that they keep track of for you really helps you enjoy the games! Getting a better score then you did last time is very satisfying, as well as seeing how well you compare to your peers. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!"
5,Hiyari chan,I‚Äôm in love with this game!üíù It is not boring like the other mental training games since the variety of small games it has is really large and each game is quite easy but at the same time it makes you think without feeling stuck or frustrated. üòÑüôåüèªThe paid version is also really cheap but even if you use the free version the ads aren‚Äôt too annoying and you have access to a lot of functions without having to pay. It takes me 5 to 10 mins a day and I already feel like I‚Äôm training my brain very well. 100% recommend. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüß†üßê
4,BobbyLws87,"So far, I am enjoying this app. I can feel my brain exercising and working in some of the trainings. I like how it‚Äôs tailored to you by answering a few questions in the beginning. You also have the ability to choose what you‚Äôd like to know about yourself, e.g. ADHD tests, personality types, IQ score, and more. You can also choose the path to improve certain skills such as your vocabulary, math skills, memory and a lot more. There are dozens of options to choose from.   This is the second night I‚Äôve used Impulse, and I‚Äôm starting by giving myself a realistic goal of training 10 minutes every day. So far, I am enjoying the games and tests.. I took and IQ test and was where I expected to be. All backed by science.   So far I have no negative feedback or criticisms to provide. I‚Äôll check back in in a couple of weeks with regards to any progress or improvements in my day to day.   So far, I do recommend giving Impulse a try if you‚Äôre serious about improving certain cognitive functions or learning more about yourself, or both."
5,peace bwithyu,"If you download this to see what type of ADHD you have, you‚Äôre wasting you‚Äôre time. I already have ADHD and it said ‚ÄúSevere Signs of ADHD‚Äù and seek medical help. YOU SHOULD STILL DOWNLOAD THIS APP!   There are so many helpful brain tests you can do daily that you can set between 5, 10, or 15 minutes a day (I only did 5 because I‚Äôm way to ADHD to remember and when I do it‚Äôs too much time in my day at that moment).   Also - there are tests to learn your IQ, what your emotional intelligence is, your Archetypes, take a quick IQ, left brain vs right brain test, etc - I learned so much about myself that nobody or counselor would have ever told me. You can find what career is best suited for you too!!  I have a 129 IQ when for the longest time I thought I was completely stupid. I knew I was right brained and was drawn to music, but for a career wise I never considered it as an option. You just have to try it to understand what I mean. Do the trial at least, take the tests, you‚Äôll be changed."
5,abkgatojab,"Although I have only just completed my second day with Impulse, I am already able to see that I will benefit from following this program. Both my physical and mental fitness suffered while undergoing the rigors of caring for my Dad in my home during his last seven years, while remotely working full-time. I have been slowly building back my physical strength, but at 65 I don‚Äôt want to neglect my mental fitness. So far I am finding the program both challenging and encouraging. As well, there seems to be great kindness built into the feedback, something I genuinely appreciate and need at this point in time."

I have noticed a change in the speed in which my brain ‚Äúfires‚Äù‚Ä¶ as if to compare it to a bulave compression engine. Like in an old V8 car. The timing of the engine. I‚Äôve run more less like a sputtering & untimely mess. But it‚Äôs be more accurate and runs better‚Ä¶ my brain that is‚Ä¶ Bottom line is, it‚Äôs helping and I‚Äôll keep using it. Your brain is like a muscle except it needs more than a stress workout. This is what it needs."
2,0112592,"I like the app, I did the free trial. The problem is: I use my payment info for the free 3 day trial but if after every test I only get to see the 1st line of my test result with the huge add to unlock full results,I can choose between yearly or weekly after my 3 day trial. I will already have weekly since I had to use my payment info so I don‚Äôt need to see the ad that covers 80% of my screen for an app that‚Äôs not a free trial. The marketing to get me to purchase the app is irritating. That‚Äôs a lot of sneaky marketing for 6.99 a week or 70 a year. 6.99 is not a big deal $70 a year is not a big deal but when the marketing is making it a big deal then that‚Äôs a No for me.  Honest reviews are hard to come by. Honesty in general from anything anymore is hard to come by."
5,kirbylynne,"I really enjoy using this app instead of my Solitaire app. I enjoy both equally, but I‚Äôm just a puzzle sort of girl and I like things that are a little bit more challenging and strategic than other games available. This is such a wonderful because it‚Äôs also going to help keep my brain strong, the brain has in mind or an organ, and we have to flex them in order to keep in tact and grow as we mature over the years. I can‚Äôt recommend this up enough. I absolutely am proud of myself for buying it and for the year and I look forward to seeing my progress over the year."
5,Zayn Sami,"As a psychology and neuroscience enthusiast, Impulse has blown my brain away!   I've spent many weeks reading about brain training & cognitive performance over the past year, and specifically about boosting memory, attention, and retention.  Let me tell you, this app is what was missing from my daily life. I couldn't always train my brain when at work or university; that always ended in mental burnout. However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind.   The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment.   I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability. I wish the premium version was free so that I'd make full use of this app.   With that being said, keep up Impulse!"
5,Rodo P,"I have been using this brain training app for a few days now and I have to say, I am impressed with the results. The app offers a variety of games that are designed to improve different cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.  I particularly enjoy the variety of games offered - from matching cards to solving puzzles, there is something for everyone. The app also has a progress tracking feature which is helpful for monitoring my progress over time.  I appreciate that the app encourages daily use, as it has become a habit for me to play the games every day. It's an enjoyable way to challenge my brain and I have noticed an improvement in my focus and concentration since I started using it.  The user interface is clean and easy to navigate, and the app runs smoothly on my device. The daily reminders are also helpful for keeping me on track.  Overall, I highly recommend this brain training app to anyone."
5,Ash Diamonds,"I have severe ADD and I have been feeling my brain functionality slipping away from me. I have been thinking that I need to do more brain training activities but didn‚Äôt take the initiative on doing crosswords, sudoku etc. I found Impulse and have felt that it helps me really use some knowledge that I once knew and used back in high school that I have sort of forgotten and I think remembering those methods and triggering the archives of my brain have made a huge difference! I feel like I am using more of my brain than I was before I started using Impusle. Even if it‚Äôs just a few minutes a day."
5,gingerüêàkit,"When I first had Impulse, I kind of already knew what it had in store for me. I knew that it would have stuff like water sort (it‚Äôs CANDY sort instead tho) and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kind of it. But I was wrong! It has an amazing variety of games that make me feel good about myself, especially that one time when it said I did 99% better than my peers at strange lights (I forgot the name), and other things. The only thing that I‚Äôd change is HOW MANY LEVELS THERE ARE. I mean, the candy sort puzzle has more than 1k levels, and it tells me someone did that all in 6 min??? No way I‚Äôm doing that.."
5,Lorena.thebest,"Hi my name is Lorena, and I think this is the best app for kids to teens. I‚Äôve been struggling to focus and concentrate in school and this app made me think ways that I never did. My life was filled with parent teacher conferences because of my strange behavior but I never really noticed why, until I downloaded this app. This app lead me to changes in my life and school, I thought this app was useless but it‚Äôs filled with games, puzzles, and quizzes. The games are filled with math questions, sorting, and memory. I love how this app lead me to possibilities in life that I thought I never will. So I rate this app 5 stars for that reason."
5,ulawr,"I‚Äôve been trying to get into some kind of morning routine, as mornings have always been difficult for me. Despite my best efforts, I end up snoozing my alarm at least thrice and once I wake up, I start looking at my phone. Instead of having an existential crisis over a spam email, I‚Äôve been trying the exercises and taking the quizzes on this app. I find myself with less cognitive grogginess in the morning the last few days, and I go back to the exercises when I pick up my phone rather than a known stressor. It is so good to have had and still be having."
5,Rezurektionist,"I had multiple heart attacks in 2004 & 2006. After that I was put on disability which was f course in that time frame was the opioid epidemic that still rages on beyond this steroidal cold & flu (China virus). After my heart started to straighten out in 2017, I got clean and I‚Äôm back to working full time. Something is foggy in my brain though. I‚Äôm startled very easily and my concentration is far from what it used to be. These tools are helping ease my mind, use it again like a muscle, and all around better my life. I appreciate apps like this and the minds that went into the process of thinking about healing a dysfunctional mindset. Thanks!"
5,kyliedyke,i think this is a really good game and it makes me happy that they ask for feedback because it feels like they actually care about the people playing the games. I like that i can play this for free with ads but also if i didn‚Äôt want ads i could pay for a subscription. i also like that if they do include ads they don‚Äôt bombard you. the games are challenging but not too challenging to the point where i can‚Äôt play. it makes me feel accomplished when i do play a game and get it right because i actually have to use my brain to figure it out. definitely one of my new favorite apps
5,Wickd Wendy,I‚Äôm 59 and I‚Äôm a college graduate and I found to my surprise that the app is fun and my brain can definitely use some training. My IQ has been tested at above average before college and then I took the IQ test in the app and I am only at the average level yet it only took me two days to get back to the point I was as a youngster but I can see where I can benefit from further training. I can see I slipped because since I‚Äôm disabled now and unable to work any longer and I‚Äôm not using my brain the way I used to I have lost the edge. Well this app makes it fun to see if I can get that edge back.
5,My Zen Life,"As someone with multiple sclerosis, I find it helpful to wake up and do the games. I feel proud of my brain, smart, and capable, instead of being afraid that my brain is struggling. This app proves to yourself that you are improving and that you are able. Thank you! (Also, it feels pretty awesome to see your excellent stats compared to the public, if you‚Äôre doing well. I felt very smart to be ‚Äú98‚Äù percent faster than most the first day. I do play 12 instruments and speak 5 languages. Maybe I‚Äôm in better shape than I thought. I‚Äôm grateful for this app! Thank you!"
5,MikeTashaHOH,"As an avid over thinker, someone who cares about my intelligence, my functions of my brain and my ability to process information at a rapid pace. I love this! Costs money but there is no price on how smart you are and can be! I look at worse possible situations in life and want to stay ahead of them incase a life or death issue occurs and I have to react, plus I want to be smart really smart for my kids. 125 IQ is pretty good enough for high school work or any grade below that but I want to show my kids what being smart can achieve for yourself. Must download and buy if you care about similar things."
5,Sablesai,"As someone who can be a little skeptical of simple games  improving your mental focus,  after playing it for a little while I can honestly say that I do feel like I‚Äôm being mentally stimulated while I play these games. I think with all the entertainment and distractions that occupy our brain space on a daily basis I would definitely encourage others to give this app a try if they want to do something that‚Äôs going to be proactive and keep their mind sharp. The prices also seem reasonable and doesn‚Äôt seem like it  would break to many peoples pocket and the trade of would be well worth it."
1,Valkyrie333,"Update - after using the App every day from the time I purchased the Lifetime Access option, I was suddenly blocked out of the App, and can no longer log in or even access at all. It‚Äôs like my purchase was never made, starting from square one. I did reach out to Impulse support, and received an E-mail Failure notification from G-mail. Since this doesn‚Äôt appear to be resolvable, I‚Äôm going to request a refund, through Apple and also PayPal, since they both protect buyers in this type of situation. Absolutely ridiculous.   I love this app, I thought it was great that they offered the Lifetime purchase option, which I chose to purchase. Since I‚Äôm nearing 60 years old, it definitely is important to me to stay sharp and strengthen any cognitive abilities I have and retain them. I love the different options."

Still there is doubt so you set out to challenge your wit. In my journey I debate with some fellers who may or may not be all that dim and no point gets proven.   But this game!!! I am getting scores 95% above my peers and proving to myself, and others, that I have been keeping up this whole time. It‚Äôs THEM who are pulling up the rear‚Ä¶"
5,itsyogurllilly,Heh-sorry for advertising in the top-but this games amazing!sure I sorta wish the free trial wasn‚Äôt their but it acctully let‚Äôs me play without one unlike other games!I would recommend buying it I can‚Äôt bc I‚Äôm a kid-anyway I recommend it if you have anxiety or want too unwind I have anxiety y and also want too unwind it works like a charm you really should download it I love this app whoever hates on it is either a hamster or a type of animal No offense bc I mean that littaraley :/ it‚Äôs true tho so please buy this creators thank you so much the daily games are amazing like I am playing right now so bye ima play ur app s‚Äômore! Bye!
4,Dishatto,"The only reason I gave this app a four star review is because it has a lifetime membership. Most apps do not! The lifetime membership makes it worth it because hopefully they will improve it overtime.  Right now the games are pretty boring and even doing your absolute best you get a very low score. I can‚Äôt beat more than 4% of the population on most games, and they don‚Äôt actually give you any tips or suggestions on what you are doing wrong or how to improve. So, not sure how this app is going to improve your brain. Instead it just shows you your limitations.  Yet, something still draws me to the app.  The graphics are fantastic."
5,FelonyMay,"This has really improved my math and memory within just a couple days, I didn‚Äôt graduate high school and I wanted to learn more and at least keep my mind active, especially being out of school for over 5 years now, this has helped me tremendously and it‚Äôs so fun to do instead of mind numbing equations with no praise. It even tells me how well I have done compared to my peers, I love this app so far. I have no complaints what so ever! It‚Äôs also very affordable and I thank the creators for making it super simple, fun, and reliable for learning and keeping my mind active. Thank you!"
1,Mortal Fool,An absolute scam! I don't even know what this app is. I have never tried it. If I downloaded it by mistake it is only because of some questionable practice where I accidentally clicked on an ad or something. I would NEVER have agreed to weekly charges.  I know what a free trial is and how you need to cancel. I did NOT knowingly try this app. But I have been charged for over 6 months. The charge is intentionally small ($6.99/week) so it blends in as an Apple charge amongst other charges on my credit card. I'm sure that is intentional so you don't notice it until too much time has passed. Apple will not even investigate a refund back past 60 days (Terrible support on Apple's part because they aren't ensuring the app developers follow their policies). I have emailed GMRD's app support. We shall see if they resolve the matter.
2,cowgirlbob,"I‚Äôm sorry I purchased this game. I‚Äôm aging, and interested in ‚Äúso-called‚Äù brain trainers to keep my mind sharp. This is not it. It offers the same games over and over with no feedback on how to improve. It only gives you a one line, ‚Äúyou did better than X % of your peers.‚Äù How is that helpful? There needs to be more variety. There is one game that I particularly hate, ‚ÄúArrows,‚Äù because I cannot get my touch on my phone to register and I always have to swipe several times on each arrow instead of once. It‚Äôs really frustrating.   The only reason I gave Impulse two stars instead of one is because the tests do offer some interesting and helpful information. It needs a much wider range of more interesting games and puzzles, though."
5,housty,"Seemed likes a very well thought out application with the science to back it up. I got interested in this because of a TBI after an assault. Many of the tests done by various therapists to gauge my cognitive abilities in order to pair with the proper PT coaches and therapists are similar to what they do in this App. It‚Äôs like having a coach or a PT leader in your phone. Day 1 was pretty painless. Low investment, high reward. By the end I could definitely feel my brain had been stimulated and was kicked into gear. Maybe only 1st gear for day one, but it was perfect and left me looking forward to what is in store tomorrow. Impressed. Excited!"
5,DaisyKellan,"I‚Äôm 24 and I have really bad ADHD and my attention span is that of a squirrel. When I downloaded this app, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much just because I‚Äôve tried these apps before and could never stick with them. When I tell you I love this app, I mean it with my whole heart. The reminders aren‚Äôt too frequent but frequent enough that I can see them and I‚Äôm not getting drowned in stupid notifications. I‚Äôm able to focus on the games because they aren‚Äôt too long and I even find myself playing more after my daily exercises. Thank you so much to the creator of this app!"
4,wzxvvm,Quick and easy games and challenges make you feel accomplished. I really enjoy seeing how I measure compared to others so it gives me a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses. I let my son play the color connecting game- and I was amazed at how quickly he was able to navigate the game to level 10! Made us both feel really awesome. Very excited to see this platform expand. It would be great if there was at least an option for a free version where you could only play a limited number/ limited game access for those who do not have the disposable income for games but still deserve a mental health break.
5,GleRu,"I began using this game after I having some memory and processing issues after an illness. I had to leave teaching after 28 years of loving my job. I began Impulse at a snail‚Äôs pace, and was extremely frustrated. The great thing is that the program would let me work until I finally got it down. I could repeat games and that helped me build confidence. Now, there‚Äôs rarely a day go by that I‚Äôm not using this app. When I get through all the exercises I begin again.  Please keep adding to these games, because it has truly been a healing tool for me.  Thank you!"
5,Mini.Mousse,"At work I have open space at random times while I wait for customers, so having a game to play in the meantime that‚Äôs got variety makes the day more enjoyable! The visuals are also very pleasing, it‚Äôs not the most funky app but the simplicity is nice, it‚Äôs different than what I‚Äôm normally around. It also keeps track of the days you‚Äôve done in a week, which I am not personally the biggest fan of but I‚Äôm sure someone would appreciate it. There is additional practices/games able to play for cash, but even then the free ones are enough to appreciate the app."
5,jbwillia,"It‚Äôs fun, challenging and you get to see how you‚Äôve stood up on each challenge to their user base as a whole. It‚Äôs much better than those meme quizzes you find on social media. It‚Äôs still new, so I don‚Äôt know this: it would be cool if it somehow integrated with social media such you could also be compared to people that you know. It would also be cool if your ongoing progress could be tracked to produce and show your iq based on your collective results over time.  Altogether it‚Äôs quick, it‚Äôs a quick easy and fun way to exercise your brain without any sweat‚Ä¶"
5,(^-^) smiling,I love this game it helps in a wide range of problem from as easy as Boredom. All the way to anxiety and stress relief. Which you can‚Äôt get everywhere I do like that it has fun mini-games too! I don‚Äôt have many down sides to this game. Although I would like if after the tests they would share some more ways to cope. Like if it was anxiety some easy ways to cope when you don‚Äôt have a phone or anything to entertain yourself with. But not including that one down side this game is one of the best I have downloaded and I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
5,NoPauseButton,"Using this app has made me become more intellectually aware of my own capabilities and my downfalls. This app is a good way to learn more about yourself and really round out your character, making you into a better person as a whole. Definitely recommend this app to anyone. Especially to those that may feel lost or in a rut. This app made me realize that I actually have an iq of 134, and I feel more motivated to learn more skills because of that. Hopefully this app will reach more people and give them the eye opening experience that I have acquired."
4,EllaBellaBoo12345678911,"This game is very fun and entertaining, but of course there's adds. Every time I finish a level there is an add. I think that's why I stopped playing last time, but this time I decided to give it a second chance. If there was no adds or even just a couple I would be satisfied, yet there is still millions of adds. Aside from that overall it is really fun and is really challenging my brain and making be healthier which is my goal. I think it's also really good for ADHD because you don't have to play the same game. There is also games for it, so you can work on your attention span."
2,Sbro1133,"Took the first few exercises, really enjoy it nominated to be in the free trial run of course not gonna spend 6.99 a week on something I don‚Äôt try first right! Anyway liked the first few exercises then the first 72 question test came up telling you what type of archetype you have and type of personalities that stuff got all the way threw the test and here come the results‚Ä¶ all right cool let‚Äôs see these results‚Ä¶. NOT how about you pay 6.99 a week for these results even though your in the trial mode‚Ä¶. ABSOLUTE TRASH AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD A PAYING CUSTOMER ON THE HOOK WAS GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR APP AND I DONT PAY FOR ANY APPS I MEAN NON!! Good job showing what‚Äôs to come in the future if I did pay for the app‚Ä¶. Y‚Äôall need to rethink what free trial means absolute garbage not cool!"
5,Calimilf78,"Keep your mental cognitive abilities sharp as you age couldn‚Äôt be more important! Keeping your mind actively engaged (watching TV doesn‚Äôt count) helps to keep dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs at bay and slows its progression. I work in senior home health care and have seen the difference of what happens and how fast it can between individuals who remain active and read and engage their brain in more than tv and those who don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs in your best interest to keep your mind active, engaged and challenged. There couldn‚Äôt be anything more important to do for yourself as you age except perhaps practicing balance! Lol"
5,LRK7717,Impulse has so many interesting games and exercises that challenge your mind in so many ways. It even reviews some math lessons if you need a refresher. It does cost a little money. In the registration process it makes it seem like your cheapest option is a 3-day free trial and then $6.99/week but then I clicked on the x and was able to start to play. Then a screen popped up in which you need to guess where the reward was and I found an 89% off coupon. I decided that $0.57/week was worth it. Good luck finding a good coupon! Try not to get addicted like I am!
1,Ginger_123,"This is by far one of the most greediest companies ever. I downloaded this app because I saw it on Facebook. I then deleted it because it costed money. (I did this forever ago and forgot I even downloaded it). I got a call from my bank telling me that someone in California was trying to charge money to my account on ITunes for 42 dollars. I thought someone stole my information and was trying to buy stuff with it. So I cancelled my card, and got a new one. Every time I try to download something on my App Store, it won‚Äôt let me because I owe money. I thought it was because of my card being cancelled until I got a new one that still didn‚Äôt work and called Apple. I‚Äôve been trying to get these people to delete the charge from my account and they aren‚Äôt replying to me. And I‚Äôm not going to pay the money for a subscription I never made."
5,are there no nicknames anymore,"I‚Äôve definitely noticed some improvements in my ability to focus and hold more information in my brain at once, which I struggle with. So this app works for sure. I purchased the lifetime subscription as I‚Äôm very fond of brain training apps/games and I‚Äôm definitely glad I did with this app. I hope the developers will cycle in new games so that mastering a brain skill continues to be fun. I‚Äôve nearly maxed out all the games and I‚Äôm not sure I would continue to reap the training benefits once I have because I will probably stop playing the games with no new levels to beat."
5,ELogical3@BandLabAPP,"This app really is very accurate and helps to not only improve our sensory and extra sensory perception but our basic senses all while keeping our brain functionality increasing and sharp (keeping you on your toes so to speak) that it carries over on your everyday life, thinking problem solving ability especially under pressure anyone who always is interested in pushing their full potential as a human being and pushing beyond your limits in real life then impulse is a must have app to keep your mind sharp in all ways."
5,BbDL4L,Impulse review keeps me busy and I also can practice and learn new things. I think everyone should have the impulse app because every now and than you need a little help. to remind yourself of how smart you actually are or how much smarter you can be. Practice makes perfect. You forget some things the older you get but impulse improves and helps remind me how much I not only miss school but how I wish I were young again. Teachers don‚Äôt stress enough how important school is and what learning can do and it also make a person who they are if not more.
3,Touchngo1976,"As a person with deutan color deficiency (very common among those who are color blind) I must tell you that your ‚Äúcolor blind‚Äù version of the Fans Count game where you count uniforms of different colors is not very color blind friendly. Using small shapes in a uniform is not distinctive enough to quickly count. I still try to rely on color however the blue and purple(?) uniforms (the ones with circle and a square) are very difficult for a color deficient person to tell apart quickly.  It would be better if you changed this game to not use a uniform, but instead use an entire shape colored differently and don‚Äôt use purple and blue. Use one or the other but not both."
5,megd4adhd,"Definitely worth it. I paid for the year and I use it consistently for periods of time when I remember. There are many many different choices for games and it does help improve speed for making connections quicker I have noticed. It also seems easy for a lot of them, but they have enough levels that it can get difficult enough so you don‚Äôt get bored from it being too easy. I have severe adhd and I am hoping it can help improve focus. I need routine so this is an extra thing I have added to help. Love it so far!"
5,6Iron6Megan6,"I have been enjoying this game SO MUCH. I have been personally dealing with some cognitive issues, this game has been my official go-to getaway. It is so hard to take time for yourself, and for me I tend to feel a bit guilty when I do. This helps me center myself and allows me to step back. It offers a healthy distraction, and I never feel drained post play. My ADHD completely swallows me up sometimes, and I‚Äôm trying to be less medication dependent and more productive with my day to day activities.  Thank you soooo much for creating such a wonderful app!"
3,Btrfly9,"UPDATE: I will give credit to the developer for reaching out. The app did not charge me a second time. I did cancel within the first day of having the app and it should not have charged me at all. So I will give this 3 stars instead of 1.   I downloaded the free trial and played for about an hour. It's not bad but I decided I did not want to pay for it. I cancelled after about an hour of play. Looking in my subscriptions it said it expired in the three days. HOWEVER on the third day (expiration day) it charged me $6.99 for 7 MORE DAYS OF PLAY! When I open the subscription now there is NO CANCEL option, only renewal options. You are ripping me off!!!! Reporting your app!!!"
4,MrFal$etto,"It‚Äôs a cool app, accurate test results and fun games.  I just thought it was funny that after I signed up for a 3 day free trial to premium then did a 20 min IQ test I would have access to the test results but they wanted me to upgrade from my 3 day premium trial to an actual premium subscription which is something I‚Äôv never seen an app do before lol.  I will continue to use this app because it is pretty cool but it would of been nice if they stuck to there word when they said ‚ÄúFree Trial‚Äù for all premium access.  I can‚Äôt afford a subscription I have too many cause all crap is now days is subscriptions, I‚Äôm broke because of it."
2,Lfree4,"When I looked at getting this app, it stated VERY clearly that there was a 3-day free trial, after which my iTunes account would be charged. It also stated very clearly that to cancel this, it would have to be more than 24 hours before the three days was up. Got it. Check and check.  I figured with so many positive ratings, it has to be legit and above board, so I proceeded.   Upon installation, it also stated very clearly that I could cancel in the settings of the app. Ummmm... there are precisely ZERO ways to cancel in the settings of the app. Zero. I‚Äôve ‚Äúleft feedback‚Äù through there, but there are no account settings to be found anywhere in this app. Highly disappointed at the intention deception here. I will be notifying Apple directly that I do not authorize any charges for this app."
5,Gabeh911,Epilepsy has caused me a tremendous amount of memory loss and I‚Äôm in the process of retraining my brain. This app has been amazing in aiding me during that process. There‚Äôs so many different learning games that are genuinely entertaining and the ones I use are nearly identical to the tasks I practice with my speech therapist(memory doctor). I paid for the app without much concern as one visit to my doctor is something like twice the cost of the lifetime subscription. It‚Äôs truly and excellent game and a go to of mine whenever I have downtime.
5,Burke Raleigh,"I‚Äôm always conscious of keeping up with my brain health. I‚Äôm 38 and I love the idea of technology helping us a few mins a day to stay more productive in the ol‚Äô noggin.  I had another brain game app that I did for 103 days straight! But eventually I got bored with is. This is similar but also a whole new set of games. And what I also love is it tells you what you need to accomplish to level up! *  * the other game I used would almost randomly level me up, it didn‚Äôt make any sense at times how it would be achieved. I like accomplishing goals but that‚Äôs just me"
3,TVeblen,"I paid $50+ for premium access which is worth it to me for life time access (is that true?) I would never tolerate the ads and the monthly subscription. I enjoy the puzzles and games. The testing I consider pseudo scientific and pretty pointless. The brain training overemphasizes speed. I‚Äôm 79 years old and fast thinking was a source of error even when I was younger. Speed kills. I don‚Äôt know how this compares to other ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù apps. I doubt any of them are of much benefit. My motto is ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt fun don‚Äôt do it.‚Äù I find this reasonably fun, but I only use it a few times a week and I ignore all the prompts to keep going and go faster."
2,XXhackssss,"Look, it does actually match the ads that promoted it, which was nice, unlike some games. However, paying to get your results seems kinda like a jerk move. You know you don‚Äôt HAVE to squeeze every dollar out of people that just want to take tests and puzzles to relax! I got this app thinking it was going to be playable (due to its 4.7 rating). Turns out those people who rated it are probably either really rich, really gullible, or complete liars. This game is not playable, I‚Äôm tired of being asked to pay yearly/weekly (I‚Äôve only played this game for 10 minutes now), and can we have the option to get our results by watching an ad? At least then this app might get 3 stars outta me."
1,Ikerus,"If you are going to charge for using your app, just put the cost up front, before you download it. Don‚Äôt try and see if you can catch people off by making it free and then right after your splash screen (before actually using your app) throw in a cost to use the app. There‚Äôs a difference between apps the cost money to download and in app purchases. This is the bastard of the two, trying to sneak in a app that cost money up front, but after you download it for free. You don‚Äôt do this as a marketing strategy, you do this because you know there‚Äôs a chance that some people won‚Äôt notice. Hoping that someone will see it‚Äôs free and miss the outrageous cost of $7 a week. You‚Äôre app isn‚Äôt worth $7 in total let alone weekly. This app should be flagged and taken down. For trying to take advantage of people."
5,Andrew Hopper,"This app is one of the few I‚Äôll take the time to write a review on. The yearly plan is incredibly worth while if you are serious about personal exploration and personal growth. This app is 100% something I believe in. After just one month of using it I can honestly say that I am more alert of myself and those around me. I have since departed from a unhealthy state of mind and sharpened my intellect. I highly recommend this app, not just to a select few, but everyone. This app is worth while in more than one way."
5,Stonefly88,After being traumatized in a life changing event PTSD has turned my world upside down. Fighting anxiety on a daily basis has changed my way of thinking and processing real life problems. This app has helped me reduce anxiety while retraining my thinking habits by focusing on the problems in front of me while building my condo in myself knowing that I am ok and that I still can solve problems like other people who don‚Äôt have PTSD! Thank you for creating this app it has saved my life! Thank you!
5,uhjiyyf.imimkil,"I‚Äôve been playing this for 2 years. I recommend it to everyone. A family member recently moved in with us and had suffered from mental abuse as well as little to no logical thinking. I bought this app for them and they have improved tremendously in just 2 weeks. They are almost addicted to it, because when they do good, or win a game it releases dopamine - improving their mental motivation in critical thinking as well as boosting their overall well-being of confidence. I can not recommend this app enough."
4,Vanillacocobean,"Yes it‚Äôs true! Trying this app was on an actual impulse for me. Pun intended lol! So far I‚Äôm liking the app. I‚Äôm not too far but I‚Äôm already giving a review, so what does that tell you?  I look forward to continuing the fun games it‚Äôs giving me. In hopes it helps my confidence even in the little things. Every little bit helps! Especially if it‚Äôs Made to help! Which it‚Äôs said this app impulse does help improve your thinking cognitively. And just your everyday living, focus and attention. I plan to continue playing. I‚Äôm not the type of person to continue in something if I feel it‚Äôs a waste of time. So enough said.üòå"
5,Lys Brooke,"Honestly, when I downloaded this game I thought I would be bored of it after a few minutes. But there are so many different games and puzzles you can do that you literally have so many options to play you just never really get bored. I downloaded this game yesterday and I play to at least level 25 on each game before I moved forward to try another one. This game is super fun and he‚Äôs there are some parts of it that are locked until you pay for it but you still have so many options to use for free! I really do love this game!"
5,Eva Ava queen eva,Bro I wanted to sleep more so I started playing this game when I supposed to go to sleep and it help me go to sleep right away and this also trained my mind for school aswell I just love these brain training and I love it so much I love it I love it I love it and I love it I love the way you are you know I love you and you have the same feelings and you have my feelings so you are the one who are you and you know that you have the brain training And I love it because you‚Äôre my best I have to go and I‚Äôm a really good teacher and you are you have you have to do
1,Wild turkey101,"I only wanted to evaluate the app but instead they signed me up for $6.99 a month!   App looked interesting and showed a 3day free trial. However, when I clicked ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù to the next screen to evaluate the rates and conditions, it automatically subscribes you for $6.99 a WEEK!!  Holy hell that‚Äôs a massive bait and switch.  App pops up a quick ‚Äúyou can cancel from settings‚Äù note after they fraudulently subscribed you. So,  I knew I was screwed so decided to cancel that minute. Nope!! It‚Äôs no where to be found in settings. Here is where you find it:  It‚Äôs in your subscriptions tab inside your ITunes and App Store section inside your Apple ID section. Wow! Blown away at how it subscribed me without showing me pricing, terms, condition or confirmation that I actually wanted to subscribe.  To developer: don‚Äôt even waste your time responding you fraudulent SOB!"
3,asher 7233,So far I like it just not the fact that the ads are so heavy or the pushing on about how I need to pay. As a person who struggles with mental health or just likes to take my mind off bad things I go to impulse but the heavy amount of ads distract me or the constant pressure to pay for this app is honestly to much for me. But I continue to use it because it does work well when I need it. So thank you impulse but it‚Äôs hard to use when mentally all you think about is if you need to be paying and if you don‚Äôt how much are you truly missing. It‚Äôs a great app but if you really want to help make it less pushing it‚Äôs a lot to take. Overall a great app tho üòÅüëçüèæ
5,Dana Doo roo,I am thoroughly enjoying impulse at this early start because my brain is sharp already but getting older and body is slowing down. So I need these exercises to help accommodate the body trying to keep up. The exercises are challenging yet fun. They keep you focused and do not leave room for distraction. It is easy to stay on point when so challenged on the game and exhibit discipline for yourself to stay on task for the exercise. I love it and most likely will continue after trial. I am also experimenting with having fewer headaches and handle stress more effectively.
5,ùîêùî¢ùî™,"Not only does it give you something to do if your bored, but also helps literally train your brain, you can also take an IQ test that I thought was really cool and everything is easy to follow and fun! Let‚Äôs ur brain wind down in a GREAT WAY cause it benefits you at the same time! There‚Äôs not many apps I end up keeping because they tend to bore me after a while or you find you just don‚Äôt use them but this one is definitely something special and worth keeping! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!!!ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèºüíØüíØüíØ"
1,Slou5,"I have never written a review for an app until now. My experience has been so frustrating that I feel obligated to comment and warn others. It was a great app for the first 3 days. I completed the daily games and was even spending an extra 30 minutes on the extra games. But Day 4 I was bombarded with repeated extended video game ads with no way to skip. Clicking on the arrow to skip just brought me to the purchase app sceeen. Closing and reopening app just opened the ad again or to the Home Screen but when I clicked on start playing the brain games, it went straight to the ads again in a maddening loop. I really enjoyed this app and am so disappointed I have to delete it, but this is ridiculous."
5,Brainwashed people,"I love this app!, I really feel like it provides great brain work outs & it helps you get a better understanding of yourself and the causes of your problems for example I did the anxiety test and it shows why I may be struggling with it and how I can help it. This app is great for road trips or even just laying in bed when you can‚Äôt sleep or you need something to do with you time, instead of doing meaningless time consuming things you can use this app to exercise your brain or take some fun tests and learn more about yourself."
2,wisp58,"Downloaded the game just over 2 months ago. Played daily and experienced good progress. Game algos appeared to be well written and fair as well as encouraging progress. I have played several ‚Äòbrain‚Äô games and this one seems likely to increase its set targets of memory, speed of thought, thinking agility etc. I‚Äôm also familiar with many of the psyche tests offered, took Al of them and they were consistent with previous results.    BUT ‚Ä¶. I ventured into 2 IQ tests ‚Ä¶ the 30 min 60 ques and the shorter 15 min 30 question and both tests contained questions in which the right answer was NOT one of the choices available. In the 60 ques test (which was a similar format of ques as the std Stanford Binet and Weschler tests) 6 questions I encountered did not contain the right answer in the options given. I‚Äôve taken the Stanford Binet and Weschler multiple times over the decades as a matter of curiosity to gage how my IQ might have changed. Neither of these tests proffer an accurate set of questions.   For what it‚Äôs worth.   For a very well written game for someone interested in brain work is Lumosity."
4,ndjdudjd,"I really like the app and enjoy taking the tests, I just wanna know if I NEED premium to see results, because I won‚Äôt lie, finishing a lengthy test just to be shown that I can‚Äôt see my results is kinda annoying. I get it, it‚Äôs a free app, you need to make money somehow, but wouldn‚Äôt adding a feature that allows you to see your results by watching adds be a good alternative to premium? I mean, many people use this app, and presumably use premium, so I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôd get enough money already. No shade, I really enjoy this app, I‚Äôm just not in the place to pay for premium y‚Äôknow?"
5,mo zone,"I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt sureI  would like this app , but I think it‚Äôs awesome. I love to time myself doing search a word puzzles and I think that this app will help me to learn how to focus more and become a better thinker in math, and everything else as well. I also like the way you mix up the subjects you are doing. I wasn‚Äôt a very good student but I believe that with your games and the fact that I have to pass the test before I can advance to the next test is really a driving force for me as well.        Sincerely, Maureen Chalk"
5,Lishaaleeanne,"I am pleasantly surprised with this app! It‚Äôs both fun and informative. I‚Äôm learning a lot about myself whilst challenging my brain in the games. I really like the tests. Not sure yet if I will pay for it afterwards because it‚Äôs a bit expensive for my liking so I am trying to do all that I can until my trial is up but if you want to challenge yourself, learn more about your performance, personality, trauma responses, etc. as well as play games to have fun while doing so, then you would definitely enjoy this app and should download it!‚ò∫Ô∏è"
3,Litany Against Fear,"I‚Äôve tried reporting the bug via Apple and via the Impulse app, maybe a review will help.   This is a great app. I was recently diagnosed with moderate inattentive-type ADHD (I‚Äôm 45 and it‚Äôs been undiagnosed since childhood) and have put the daily training into my morning routines. Then, throughout the day, I‚Äôll play the candy sort game to give my brain a different engaging activity, but I have a curious bug that will make me replay stages I‚Äôve already passed.  I can see no rhyme or reason to it. If I replay a stage, I‚Äôd like it to be because I want to, not because the app seems to think I haven‚Äôt even though the next stage is open."
4,Lady ‚ÄúT‚Äù,"Update:  appreciate the update.   Seems the math section was fixed with key boards/choices of numbers.    Unfortunately it seems Tasty fractions was overlooked.    Still enjoy the app but not being able to do tasty fractions is causing me not to have a steady streak.  This app was recommended to me and I truly enjoy until I get to fractions. I can not input my information. No drawing with pencil, finger , or even tapping on screen for keyboard. So, I never get to earn daily tasks. I am hoping there‚Äôs a glitch somewhere and the team is working on this so the app can be updated. I really do not want to delete this app."
2,üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüòòüòòüòòüòò,"This game is awesome in so many ways, except the biggest one.. customer service. I rated 2/5 stars because of the condescending and belittling customer service I received via email. I was concerned, and a little confused about a purchase I made within the app. So I emailed IMPULSE and requested assistance. Since IT/developing is not my forte, I was inquisitive on the issue. From the beginning of our conversation IMPULSE was surprisingly curt, discourteous, and not happy to help a confused customer. This is an awesome game if you never make a purchase mistake, and never need any of their help. I hope the developers will take a look at the poor correspondence I received from their company and take action so that it does not happen to another unsuspecting person."
2,FunButPayToWin,"Played a couple of games then they tried to force a subscription on me before knowing what it really was. I signed up for the free trial then instantly went into my subscriptions and cancelled the renew so I could try it for free without worrying about random fees in a few days.  I completed a couple of simple games and they tell me I did better than 90%, 92% & then 99%. Lol ok sure. After 3 mini games they offer me a yearly subscription for 92% off. (I‚Äôm 2 minutes in and this is the second time they try to ask for my money).  I reject that and try the archetype quiz (this was the main reason I checked the app out). I started filling out the 72 question personality ‚Äúquiz‚Äù, (which has multiple instances of incorrect grammar/spelling).  Once I finish guess what? I need to pay them to see the info on my ‚Äúarchetype‚Äù and get the full details. Lol I‚Äôll pass.  TLDR = If you don‚Äôt mind wasting a little money this app seems to have a decent interface, but also doesn‚Äôt seem to offer anything you couldn‚Äôt find online for free.   Save your money bc this app was just made to grab it."
5,Zack_Rose27,This app is really helpful. But you do have to pay to see your results but the games help you build concentration and other skills you are having problems with. I have a hard time concentrating on other stuff and the concentration games do help. I do recommend this app. Even though i got it 4/16. I do want to have it to where you can check on your results daily. Like you can check on of your results and you can‚Äôt check any other results for the day. That‚Äôs what i would want to see. üòÖ
5,Muhamad Raqib Argoshi,"Impulse is a dynamic app designed to enhance cognitive abilities through engaging exercises. With its diverse range of challenges targeting memory, attention, problem-solving, and processing speed, users of all ages can benefit. The app's adaptive learning system adjusts difficulty levels based on individual progress, ensuring a personalized experience. Gamification elements such as points, achievements, and leaderboards add a fun and motivating dimension to the learning process. Overall, Impulse offers a sleek, intuitive platform for anyone looking to sharpen their mind and boost their mental agility."
5,Indigo Vice,So first off the App is easy to use and gives you valuable insights on how your brain works. Doing theses exercises does help so try to test out how you feel/react throughout the day. In terms of challenges once you reach the max level you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù restart to see if you can speed through the course. Which is a bummer because it would‚Äôve been neat to try again from level one. Other thank that this app is Amazing in helping my ADHD and to pass the time while on work breaks. Keeps you sharp and witty.
4,Youllcallitfate,"I love this game, however when I subscribed I was under the impression there would be a minimum of 200 puzzles, I only have access to 180. As well as one of the badges being for completing 250 puzzles, which again caps at 180. I also submitted a help ticket at least a week ago because my training streak was resetting often when it shouldn‚Äôt have been, and received no response at all. I won‚Äôt continue my subscription until these issues are at least acknowledged but will continue playing in hopes that customer service is important to the developers ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,Coley1222,"As title suggests, I decided to go with the one year plan. 6.99 a week sounded too steep. I was going to go with free trial at first but I remembered the good reviews. I have adhd combined typed. When my brain is idle, I become depressed. With this app, I don‚Äôt have to feel like that. There are daily routines to do but also there are games just for fun that also help build skills such as problem solving, memory retention, and MATH! I hate math but this app makes it fun and has refresher tips and solutions to help you solve and get better. Best purchase this year!!"
1,Ephemera Fae,One thing that really bothers me is this slippery way apps get us in and then make it ridiculous to climb out. This app is exceptional at that from what I‚Äôve seen. It literally told me to ‚Äúcancel any time in the App Store‚Äù here I am on the App Store with no clear place to go.   I look into apps like this to help in my life long recovery from multiple concussions.  I was drawn to this one because it brings in information about Teauma responses which is of particular interest to me since my trauma responses trigger seizures since my last head injury.   That last thing I need is another to do on my list threatening to hit me with a bill or overdraft me because I tried to cancel OUT of the screen and instead it signed me into a free trail.
1,Lockwood5poet,"I am sad to leave this review, because I was enjoying checking out your content, and would‚Äôve been happy to pay for it when I had the money. I literally don‚Äôt right now, which turned out to be a good thing, because the app made no less than three unauthorized charge attempts. üò≥  The only thing I authorized was the free trial. I know because there was even text on that screen that said ‚ÄúYou will not be charged at this time.‚Äù It would certainly be easy for someone to accidentally authorize a payment to you with all the different offers and popups offering the paid version, but I was very careful to X out of all those or tap the ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äú button. Those were mildly annoying, but I wouldn‚Äôt have even minded that too much.  I DO, however, mind that you tried to charge me without my permission. Your multiple attempts (rightly) triggered my bank‚Äôs fraud alert, and I had to make several calls to get my check card unfrozen. I could‚Äôve done without that annoyance too.   Fix your app so this sort of thing doesn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôve seen apps removed from the App Store for this kind of thing."
5,Brochacho1494,I‚Äôve multiple apps to sharpen up my math and problem solving skills and finally found one that actually feels fun but also challenging. I also enjoy that they have relaxing and calming games to stimulate and tone you down. I tested it out before bed and definitely started to feel sleepy after getting past a few levels of multiple games. Give this a shot if you‚Äôre looking for that extra thing to really test where you are in certain problem solving challenges.
1,Amzles,"I paid something like $20 to buy this app so it wouldn‚Äôt have ads and had unlimited helps. I played it all the time and quickly completed all the levels of my favorite game. Then, I waited for months for more levels of that game to be developed. I was stoked they finally uploaded more! But I updated the app yesterday and I HAD ADS ADDED BACK IN! That was infuriating. I played one level with the ads and it said I could pay $4.99 more to get rid of the ads. So, begrudgingly, I paid it because I liked the game and wanted to keep playing. Then I found out that I STILL HAVE TO WATCH ADS TO GET HELPS!! Only 3 ‚Äúfree‚Äù helps unless I subscribe. Absolutely terrible business practices. Lost me as a customer. Don‚Äôt get swindled like I did. You can‚Äôt trust this developer."
5,knowswords,"Just two days using this app. The games are good and can maintain the attention levels well enough. I am in 62 years old and the exercises I am being offered to train with feel like a remediate level. Stats as compared to others doing same training exercises an extra that some might like to see in order to motivate to keep up with brain training. The IQ test is a bonus, too! Give Impulse app a try. You feel as though it is worth it to spend ten minutes a day or more helping to keep your brain active."
2,iamiiirb,"I was loving the impulse app until the most recent updated version almost burnt out my phone literally. I don‚Äôt know why or how‚Ä¶ but every time I would open the app and start playing, within 5 minutes my iphone would get extremely hot. It got so hot, the game would lag, and eventually froze my phone and I could not close out the app or turn off my phone. It just kept getting hotter and hotter. I rushed into the kitchen and pulled out a bag of frozen blueberries to cool it down and ran my phone under cold water. Then my iPhone restarted. I just ended up deleting the app because I know for a fact it was the app. It is unfortunate because I finally passed level 88 on the color ball sort. :("
1,DataBro,"To preface, I am not one to normally write reviews but this company is an absolute cash-grab nightmare.   I am sure many of you will find this app via targeted advertising on various social media platforms as I did myself. When you first download the app, you have to answer 6 questions before you‚Äôre asked to immediately purchase a plan. Feel free to do the 3 day free trial, which immediately launches a ‚Äúprize‚Äù where you magically get 92% off a yearly subscription ‚Äúon this screen only‚Äù.   Perhaps you‚Äôre still unsure, as you literally haven‚Äôt been able to use the app yet - so like myself you skip the screen instead of paying $30 for a 90% DISCOUNTED subscription. Then you take a test, which lasts 72 questions. When you finish you‚Äôd think with your 3 day free trial you‚Äôd get to see your results right? WRONG. Instead you get a message saying results are only available for those with a subscription, which does not include a the 3-day trial apparently.  Meaning, that unless you are willing to pay $30 upfront for tests that are largely available online for free, then this is an absolutely useless application."
4,R.LeeShelton,"I have ADHD as well as being a night owl in a early bird society, so it takes a lot to kickstart my brain in the morning. This is a good way to spend 10 minutes before I have to begin my day that wakes me up a bit before my morning caffeine kicks in. I knock off a star because some of the games ‚Äútutorials‚Äù do not translate really on the goal + you cannot repeat the same type of game, they will give you different games each time you log in. So if I wanted to redo a game after figuring out what the tutorial actually meant half way through the game, I am unable to do so"
2,Nirettzy,"Downloaded the app to check it out. Of course they wanted money up front before anything but I elected the free 3 day trial (a joke I know). Did a couple games that turned out well, another pop up for money dangling 92% off. Declined that offer and moved to the archetype test. You wants results? Pay! Either sign up for the subscription or pay $5 to get the report.   While I have no problem paying for a quality product or service, I have to know it‚Äôs quality first. By not providing the results, how am I to know whether I‚Äôd be satisfied? With no refund recourse, I‚Äôll pass. Developers must learn to earn trust before demanding money like every other business out there."
5,ginbin01746,"I love to procrastinate on my phone so this app gives me a reason to play games that are actually benefiting me instead of doing things that are non productive. I‚Äôm super ADHD so mini breaks are super important so maximizing my productivity. That being said, the impulsiveness that comes with my ADHD gets me sucked into whatever app I open during those breaks. With this one, I know I‚Äôm benefiting myself and it‚Äôs easier to get off the app rather than scrolling through TikTok where every different video is supposed to grab my attention and keep me drawn in. Great app idea!"
3,XxtouhouxX,"Good enough for me to play it. Solid variety of games and puzzles for your enjoyment. But I‚Äôm here more to give constructive criticism for the app. The app needs more math games and an actual ranking system, not one that I feel like is fictional. How convenient that beating lvl 10 at any game means I‚Äôm better than 99% of everyone else, every time. That‚Äôs just silly. You can continue to fool most people or you can do right and actually implement a ranking system. Additionally, there‚Äôs a lot of pseudoscience. The worst offender being the personality tests. Next you‚Äôre going to be doing horoscopes (sarcasm). I‚Äôm only being critical because I want this app to be better and more legitimate."
5,Nea b,"I really love this app! I have ADHD, anxiety and depression and I need something to help me quiet my mind and focus on just one thing at a time, but with other things like Tetris (which i love) is that it bores me fast because it becomes the same. What I love of this one is that it's not ""one"" game, but each level or game is different, so I don't get bored and I feel excited to get the next one right but it's something new, so my brain stays focused because it's interesting. I don't really mind the ads although it would be nice to not have so many cuts."
5,i‚ù§Ô∏èmac,The whole setup impulse has is cool. Us choose a goal and then they calculate how many games/time u need to put in to reach that goal. Im almost 40 and want to stay sharp for my lil one...also I like how straight forward the directions and explanations are. Compared to other similar apps... Directions were quick to pick up and start practicing/playing brain games... The refresher on math lessons I thought was cool and haven't seen that before.. Will def need to spend some time doing that lol... All in all cool app... Ads r quick n skippable. Kudos nice job on the app!
2,festatichiama,"I really enjoy the brain teasers but the score they get you at the end of each side of games is completely completely all over the map and I don't think there is anyway that it is accurate. I range between 99% in comparison to my peers to 7% in comparison to my peers, playing with similar speed andaccuracy. when you are not consistently getting an accurate score it takes all of the fun and motivation out of playing. Because you cannot tell how well you were doing. If they would fix this one thing I would give them five stars. I enjoyed all of the tests and there is even an IQ test but I doubt that it's very accurate. I have faith that any of their scoring is accurate"
1,Reviewer2597,"Impulse - Brain Training is a scam. This application should be banned and is not worth even downloading. The app is incredibly basic but before you can even try it out, you are forced to choose a paid subscription with a shortened 3 day trial. I‚Äôm not unfamiliar to these trials charging you even if you cancel but what is particularly scummy about these developers is they do not have an email or phone number you can contact them at. On every attempt to get in touch you are referred to the subscription page in your settings. I will continue to find out how I can get a refund or simply file a report through my bank and encourage you to do the same. Please leave a like or comment if you had canceled during your trial and are looking to do the same."
5,**_SCAMMERS__!!,"I‚Äôve noticed since my diagnosis in the last 30 years of my life by memory and being able to place things like I used to multitask, has gotten less efficient as I started playing Impulse to see if it would help retrain or remind my brain how to function properly. Impulse app is making me think quickly efficiently so far so it‚Äôs great I dont have any complaints if you‚Äôre dealing with some of the things the same things you might want to do a trial period and see if it helps you the same"
5,ShadowHawk245,"Impulse is very good, It has fun games, it helps your mental mind, and it‚Äôs just a good resource over all. In the beginning it personalizes everything for you. Just a couple of questions, then your account is personalized for you! It gives you games and questions to help your brain. In the beginning it asks why you chose impulse, and off of your answers it gives you personalized games to help your mental brain. It has helped me a lot with mental math, focusing, and just helping my brain over all. 5 star, I totally recommend! ‚≠ê‚≠ê"
2,ImBigPapasWife,"I did the free trial to see if I liked it and to do the tests to see my results. It keeps trying to get to to purchase the subscription and it blocks out your test results until you pay a weekly, monthly, or yearly membership. No thanks. I went ahead and canceled my free trial. Honestly what‚Äôs the point of a free trial if you‚Äôre not even giving me the full experience? I can find other game teaser games to play for free. I‚Äôm all about supporting a company and paying a subscription fee, but, I‚Äôm not about doing that and they constantly try to get extra money. That usually means they want the money quickly because there‚Äôs only so much you can do in the app. No thanks! I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere."
5,Jambykowski,"I am 41 years old and I have noticed a decline in my cognitive ability more and more lately. I saw an ad for this app and wanted to give it a try. I did one round and decided to pay for it yearly at a highly discounted price. I am trying to remember lines for an upcoming play and I was having a lot of issues with it. Once I started doing daily training, I immediately realized that it was working. I recommend this app for anyone who wants to stay mentally sharp or just have a nice cool down at the end of a long day."
5,Queen-Chief,I don‚Äôt usually have much time to play or be entertained so having not just any game but ‚ÄúIMPULSE‚Äù captivates my brain activities in multiple ways like I‚Äôm working out in a gym. Just 5-10 minutes/daily helps increases my ability to think quickly and accurately. It a brain gym. Note I don‚Äôt know the makers and this is not a promotion I‚Äôm a real person and as a matter of fact a nurse. I use it to get my brain off the floor and to help me solve problems on impulse. You can try it too but remember it‚Äôs not like any other games.
1,Kviktorovskaya,"I signed up to try this because it looked interesting, but only because it offered a free trial. I planned to try it and see if it‚Äôs worth paying for, but my trial disappeared and I was charged for this within about 3 hours of downloading and starting it. This is just a scam to charge an expensive subscription under the illusion that you can trial it first. Don‚Äôt do it. They are just making a ton of money probably off poor folks like me who are used to apps that actually honor the trial period. EDIT: I definitely did not sign up for the subscription as the developer response indicated. I am a developer myself and I know how trials work and I was definitely on the trial because it did try to upsell me in the app while I was using it."
5,Tomato Chips,After being evaluated for ADHD and ASD my psychiatric team recommended I take preventative action to delay cognitive decline. One of the recommendations given to me was to play games like the ones in Impulse to keep my mind sharp. I‚Äôve found this app to be very enjoyable and a nice way to relax for a few minutes in the evening. Many of the games in this app resemble the tasks I had to complete during my neuropsychological assessments. The graphics are pleasant. I can tell a lot of thought and care was put into creating this app.
5,Lucky_girl_329,"I am SO glad that I downloaded this app and turned on the notifications because it would've ended up in the second page in my app folder in my phone. Which means that I would never use it again and I would delete the app. (if all that made sense) But luckily I turned on the notifications and it motivated me to work my brain out. However, I am a tiny bit upset about the ads. But, that one little problem still made it to the ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ. (5 stars) Thank you for your time.  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î"
5,JmanGuajardo,This app is amazing! I absolutely love brain games and this app has so many different ones to hit all the aspects of day to day intelligence. This helps me stay super sharp. I often find myself playing more games than is included in my daily training. Great user interface and runs very smoothly. They‚Äôve nailed all the gamification aspects too to keep me coming back. My favorite aspect is to see how well I stack up against others in my age group within each level of each training game.
2,webtoon_fan123,I was watching tick tock and I saw an ad for this saying that it shows your iq gives you test to see what you‚Äôre iq is and it can even compare it it famous genius‚Äôs but when I downloaded the app it did not do any of the things listed but despite the ads lies what is does it help you exercise your brain and make you smarter (not tell you how smart you are though) and the app is good but they need to have better ads also another thing is that on one of the games (the memory game with cards) it was a little buggy and the cards change images from when I saw it to when I was guessing (hope that made sense) so it is a mostly good app but the ads lie
5,Mentally EEL,"I am really enjoying this app! i‚Äôm a recovering addict, so I have burned through most of my brain cells in life. I was also in a coma for an amount of time and have a brain injury as well.  In addition, I have a history of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs on both sides of my family. I can already see the improvement in my thinking, and the ability to remember things accurately or at all. I shared what I have been doing on this impulse app just this morning in my substance use disorder class. I recommend to anyone of all ages and health conditions."
5,Mooshoolina21,"Haven‚Äôt been playing too long but I really enjoy the games. I‚Äôve been in a mental health journey to be better for my kids, so I‚Äôve been exploring all kinds of apps and things to help me be accountable for myself and help me in different ways. As a single mom with 2 kids taking care of everything to make sure the world doesn‚Äôt stop turning, I forget a lot of things and this app so far has helped me be more mindful I‚Äôm still using the free version and I don‚Äôt mind the pop up"
5,dmichels79,I am loving the app so far. The only problem I am having is that I would like to have the progress made on my iPhone sync with my iPad. I see the option to log in with a web account but I purchased it from the App Store and never registered credentials with the app. Am I missing something? Some of the games are getting tough to see on the iPhone screen and it would be nice to play in the iPad instead. The iPhone and iPad and signed in with the same Apple ID.
4,CelesteM01,"I really like the game so far. BUT, like anything health care, and YES, mental wellness is health care, they demand that you pay a premium to have your God given right to be healthy and happy. I can‚Äôt afford, and I seriously doubt anyone who really needs this type of help can.  However, if you can afford it, I would highly recommend you that you do! It‚Äôs designed to keep improving your skills. You can compete with others or ignore the leader board and compete with yourself. (Which I highly recommend).  Overall I think it‚Äôs a good app, I just deducted the one star because of the pricing."
5,Treetop67z,I‚Äôm loving this game but I can‚Äôt afford to pay for it and that makes me sad because lord knows I need it. 56 years old and I already can see my mental capacity is dwindling fast and I‚Äôm seriously scared of what will come next. I already spend way too much time looking for keys and purse and can‚Äôt remember what I have to do and get lost in places I have been all my life. So if this game can help I would love it but I‚Äôm just not financially prepared to spend any money my house payment takes my entire check every month
4,Cvyfjfgkjgt242435,"I gave four star because not all of them are free and it‚Äôs so much fun but they should make all of them free so we can concentrate and make our brain sharp. This game is so concentrating and it helps me pay more attention in school and work and it also helps me concentrate on my work. It also calms down my stress a little bit so you should try this game too if you have stress, anxiety, or if you don‚Äôt pay attention or any other kind of things even ADHD so if you wanna calm your brain down and make your brain smart, you better download this game."
4,First Skirt,"The instructions can be insufficient. When I first started playing, there were examples; I don't get those anymore, but maybe that's supposed to make it harder. I just played a game that had the instructions as ""tap the numbers in assending order.""  Once I saw the numbers available, I started to tap. As I tapped the second number, the tiles went blank. No where in the instructions did it mention that the tiles would go blank before I should start. I lost points, because it registered my second tap as the first."
4,Darcyheathcliff,"Not sure if it‚Äôs brain training or just games disguised as education, but it‚Äôs addictive so keep that in mind. The latest update has it loading blank screens, frozen end-round moves that delay you from moving on to the next level (previously seamless), and I have to open another app and come back to trigger it to switch to show ‚Äúnext level‚Äù screen (these are all for the candy sort game). I wish I hadn‚Äôt updated; the frustration is the inconvenience that may make me finally not care about my ‚Äútraining streak‚Äù and quit."
2,CurieShakes,"I got this entirely because it‚Äôs advertised on Instagram (and the App Store) as an app to aid in understanding your ADHD type. First off the app offered a free week trial - I selected the lifetime payment option and it charged me immediately, did not give me any free trial. Downhill from there. There is a test for if you have ADHD or not, but the test advertised on Instagram and on the App Store ‚ÄúWhat is your ADHD type‚Äù with archetypes like ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù, ‚Äúinattentive‚Äù, ‚Äúlimbic‚Äù, etc doesn‚Äôt exist in the app. So the whole reason I got the app, to understand my ADHD better, isn‚Äôt part of the app at all. There are some games and such to keep your mind sharp, but if you‚Äôre looking to use this as an ADHD tool this is NOT tailored to you."
1,best use of my screen time,"Dissappointed. Cant see test results without paying. Think this should be explained prior to taking the test as its then a waste of time if you choose not to purchase. Wont be keeping app. Have no idea if the information provided/results are something I would value so no reason to subscribe. Should be better at allowing people to experience the app prior to purchasing to see if they like or not. Makes me think limited materials available/scam. Then, won‚Äôt allow you to send feedback without adding email. Also, if you play a couple games they offer subscriptions at up to 92% off weekly - like 56% a week. Don‚Äôt pay that up front price!"
5,nsnzt snsusvjd,"Impulse is a great game! The app has fun games challenging games and gives you games depending on what you need help with. For and example if you want to make your memory stronger, impulse gives you fun games to help you complete your goal. If you also wanna learn about math they have mini lesson on multiplication, decimals, order of operations, ect. The game also has quizzes to see what type of person you are based on the answers you pick. Great game overall I totally recommend downloading it. And you can play for free!"
1,try me bio u mean1222222268,"First, there are so many ads I can hardly play one game. Second, most of the ads I‚Äôve received are UNSKIPABLE. I have to continuously close the tab and reopen the app to actually play. The games really would be fun if they wouldn‚Äôt advertise other games and their own free trial every time I load into the app. It‚Äôs very irritating not for just me but for others. A lot of the good reviews are covering up the flaws about this app. It‚Äôs very upsetting because I was hoping for a game that actually kept its word. The ad I‚Äôd seen that made me want to play this wasn‚Äôt even an activity present in the app. Be real, this game needs a lot of work. Stop trying to steal peoples money and maybe people would download it and keep playing."
5,cmd 989898,"I‚Äôve just started using this app. Normally I would wait to give a review until I got to know it a little bit more but you really wanted me to review you, so here goes,  so far I am impressed.  I‚Äôve played some game I‚Äôve taken a couple of test I‚Äôve done two days of workouts. I love the explanations the math one was really good at explaining how to work through problems. The games are fun. The test were insightful. I‚Äôve signed up for a year and I think it is a app that I will use every day."
2,The report- NOW,"I know you  people out there need a way to make money. But if you made this app to help people, I don‚Äôt think you should have made it so only the ones with money could ‚Äúaccess‚Äù you‚Äôre app. You see not everybody has money to put into apps like this, but they still wanna follow as the apps intended to do. But like I said, it doesn‚Äôt help having a ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù to actually ‚Äúaccess‚Äù you‚Äôre app. Make an app that can help people without shoving a ‚Äúmoney-grab‚Äù in their face. And I‚Äôm not asking for apologies, I‚Äôm asking for improvement. So please do something about it. Like more access to more games or something like that; the app is very limited without the subscription. I know it says that it‚Äôs limited but it‚Äôs a little TOO limited."
5,Prttony,"Was skeptical of another ‚Äúmental training app‚Äù but find this to be a great alternative to blowing things up and chasing zombies games.   This app makes you feel like your actually exercising your mind through the mini activities (games) but still challenges what you think should be easy activities (matching pairs no problem! Basic math no problem!) which turn out to be interestingly challenging.  I play before bed or while drinking coffee in the AM or if just passing time waiting somewhere to get to the next level.   Interesting stats, tips and ranking against your age group make it even more involved so you see where you are against your age group.   If you‚Äôre looking for something to stimulate your mid (because you think you‚Äôre always forgetting things or worries about your mental fitness I.e. always a forgetting things :) ) then give a go!"
3,TheBrock24,I really enjoy this game because it helps work my brain but the ads in this are full screen ads of mobile games. This can get pretty annoying because impulse doesn‚Äôt advertise itself as a mobile game but treats users like it is. I also did a personality test but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to view my full results because I need ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and it would have just been better to block that 72 question quiz for f2p people than limit my results. Overall if you ignore the ads (they come between every game or between every few levels) it is a great game and I might recommend.
2,LKO~*,"After having this app for only three or four days, I mistakenly signed up for the year long subscription , which led me to believe it was going to give me the accelerated intro trial with no obligation . Well, they‚Äôre keeping my $29. Even though I canceled it on day four or five..and now they are charging me for the whole year & it will not refund my trial money, as it had promised. I gave my credit card information in good faith and got burned. it‚Äôs basically just a candy crush game with a few other memory games mixed in. they‚Äôre way too easy. They should‚Äôve given me my trial money back, but that‚Äôs the clincher for me, they‚Äôre keeping it for a year! So don‚Äôt bother with this app!"
1,2soon2review,"As someone who is truly trying to exercise their brain and grow, I am very disappointed with my purchase. I am about two weeks in and I‚Äôm frustrated that their is a time limit. I payed for this, I should get a fair chance to do all of the puzzles without being cut short because it takes me a little longer than you think it should. I‚Äôm very upset and I recommend that if you have anxiety or have a hard time with time limits or being ripped from you concentration state with a big red bell telling you that you‚Äôre too slow to finish when you have two puzzles left. If this was advertised as a race against the clock joke I would have saved my hard earned money. Save your money and read a book"
5,Silviaung18,"Not only is the app affordable, it hosts quality games that are interesting and challenging, and you can tailor / explore the games to your needs /liking. I love that they share results w/ you after each game and explain your aptitude after each test, and where you place among others who have played. Overall, I think these are great brain exercises when you need them and doesn‚Äôt waste your brain cells unlike other apps that you might use on your phone. ;P"
5,ru ke√Øn,"I‚Äôve incorporated doing the daily puzzles into my morning routine as I‚Äôm waking up and having coffee - it‚Äôs a fun way to get my brain into gear for the day, similar to how it‚Äôs helpful to stretch and warm-up the muscles before a more intense exercise. Keeping with the sports analogy, playing the games at the end of the day is a great way to ‚Äúcool-down‚Äù, i.e. relax and unwind. If doing this stuff is supposed to improve my mental sharpness, that‚Äôs an added benefit, but mainly I enjoy the reward of solving puzzles and challenging myself for its own sake."
5,36withoneontheway,I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I downloaded this app I‚Äôve tried different versions of these apps before and wasn‚Äôt impressed. I do seem to be enjoying this one since I keep coming back to it. The brain games are great they get more difficult as you level up and I‚Äôm often surprised at what I can accomplish or what I can‚Äôt for that matter. Sometimes I think a game will be easy and it‚Äôs not but most of the time I find that with practice and focus everyone can improve in time.
5,Missy2C,"This app I thought was just a cool way to just find random things and do cool little games, but it actually really is helpful. I‚Äôve noticed right away that the certain brain games it has, either to help your memory or stimulate your brain or relax your brain, that it actually does! After long days of work or just random stress or feeling overwhelmed I got from üõë to ‚úÖ. It‚Äôs so worth it, and you get to find out cool things about yourself!! Hope you try it out!"
4,mccallea,"I have ADHD and Impulse has been a huge help in a very small amount of time. I love the app, I love the stats, the tests. So awesome. That being said‚Ä¶  Why is family sharing not supported? I paid for a lifetime membership because I played a quick trial on my sister‚Äôs phone. Now I would love to share it with my significant other, who really enjoys it and plays it from my phone.  I would love to share the app without sharing stats and scores. Paying for a lifetime membership should support family sharing. Thank you for the amazing app. But c‚Äômon. You got my money, now let me share it, puh-puh-please. üôè"
3,Witch Ouija,"I actually liked the various brain games they have available, I spent the majority of the time doing word finder and the color separate game. Only complaint would be how many ads there are! I have no problem watching a couple seconds worth of ads, but I only could get through one game before I got something popping up on my screen. Most of the time, you can just turn the wifi off and remove them that way - but these guys are so stingy they won‚Äôt let you use the app without wifi/data üôÑ I won‚Äôt be spending my money on this, but if you like it maybe it‚Äôs worth the investment."
4,Sarito o Sary,"I believe this app is entertaining and educational in a sense that it will activate your learning capabilities. For example, memory, critical thinking, consistency, and it will even help you do math without having the calculator as your slave. The game about tracing the figure it my absolute favorite. It‚Äôs challenging but entertaining and helps you figure out different ways to solve a puzzle which in life concludes to figuring out different solutions to a problem. I would give a try and if you see improvement in yourself or your child I would consider purchasing it. Thank you."
5,Lilly beltz,I have seen this app advertised and I just sorta blew it off but recently I decided what the heck I‚Äôll see what it‚Äôs about and can always delete it if I don‚Äôt like it and unbeknownst to me i actually really enjoy it and I have noticed the improvement I‚Äôm getting better and better each day and I love how it has the daily challenge to show the improvement from day one to day 7 so on and so forth so yes I love this app and recommend it to all thoes who have seen it but haven‚Äôt downloaded it .
5,I‚Äôm.A.Tomboy,Impulse is the best brain game I have ever played. It‚Äôs not frustrating and filled with adds. It‚Äôs not trying to get us to buy something all the time. It also really helps me with what I‚Äôm trying to overcome. I haven‚Äôt spent even an hour on Impulse and I can already see the biggest change in me. Even with playing for hours with other games I have not seen even half of my change. I hope all of you agree and will continue to use it and tell others as soon as you see them!
5,ColonelSchizo,"I‚Äôve been looking for an app that focuses only on little games that keep my attention and help critical thinking. I have severe ADHD and the short games that are always changing really keep my attention. Not the same thing over and over.   It‚Äôs also affordable and worth it to get rid of the ridiculous ads that make you want to never touch whatever they are advertising.   I‚Äôm always wanting to improve myself and this app helps me do that, if only by a little at a time."
5,üòä‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòçüôÉüñ§üôÉüòùü§çüôÉ,I‚Äôve quite enjoyed the memory games and the math games. I‚Äôve only used it for two days so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs improving anything but I think it‚Äôs really fun to do and challenges me to think about how to respond in these games. I also enjoy the tests that they offer I thought that was a fun addition to the app. I wish the test that‚Äôs you take would adjust your game recommendations and I wish they had a game recommendation section. Overall I think the app is great graphics and color pallet and all.
5,JashaDB,"This is actually a really good game, when I first downloaded this game I expected it to be like one of those fake apps, y‚Äôknow like the ones that put out fake game ads but then when you download the app the game is nothing like what the ad says it is; luckily this app is nothing like that and honestly the TikTok ad (which is where I found this app) doesn‚Äôt do you enough justice to what the game really is, the actually app provides so much more than what the ad says and I love that. Thanks for making this! My new favorite game?!"
5,Hamez566,"Impulse is a really nice app that helps in just overall brain function. Its a really nice thing to do when you‚Äôre bored and feel like monotony. Its a very nice test for your brain that includes a lot of fun games and things to do. I only use the free version, however I still really enjoy it. It still allows you to do a lot with it. I would definitely recommend if you are hoping to improve some overall areas of brain function in your life or are ever just bored and feel like testing your mind."
5,KBCLN,"I like this app a lot. The games get more difficult the longer you play but it really does stimulate parts of your brain you‚Äôre not really using otherwise, or at least I wasn‚Äôt as a SAHM. I feel like I notice an improvement in my memory, and just overall makes me feel better mentally throughout the day. Makes focusing easier as you‚Äôre more mindful of staying on task when you do these daily. At the least, the IQ and personality tests are always fun. Definitely worth a try."
1,Robnish,"Wish I could refund my subscription! It's like the developers look through the comments about all the bugs and complaints and then double down to make it even more buggy and less efficient.  I.e. the Candy Sort has been freezing after completing a level for many months now. Instead of fixing and accommodating the many users who took time to mention this bug, they added more useless features that make the game annoying including putting a level reset right where the undo button used to be! And adding warnings that slow the game down. I've already cancelled my renewal and I'm sure many loyal subscribers will do the same."
2,Nachosbestfriend,"I got this app thinking it would be fun to know my IQ score and maybe even improve it by playing puzzle games. The puzzle games were fun and engaging (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but the tests were a complete waste of my time. Instead of saying beforehand that you had to pay to get the reports, they had me go though all the questions only to tell me afterward that I‚Äôm order to see ANY of the results I had to pay. All you got was just a tiny glimpse of what it was at the top of the screen, without any explanation. I mean, come on guys. You have three different IQ tests at different depths, you could have at least offered the basic one for free, or gave a small explanation of the basic results then have to pay for the more in depth information. Premium isn‚Äôt expensive, per se, but I just have better uses for the twenty bucks or so that it costs.  With the games and puzzles that are unlocked in the free version, this app just isn‚Äôt worth downloading. Only download if you are willing to pay."
1,Asyanurcinar,"The first time you download the app it gives you an option for 3 days free trial, however, if you do a test the results are not showing, they require you pay right that time to see the result. Excuse me but before I subscribe your app I do need to see if you are worth it but you are clearly not giving that option to people which is ridiculous. I immediately unsubscribed from 3 days trial as I‚Äôm not even able to see my test result even though free trail was provided and I deleted the app right after. Do not waste your time if you don‚Äôt wanna pay right when you download the app but if you like to try couple days. As 3 days trial apparently just to stare at the app for free and play the stupid games that available."
5,Charles_A34,"This app has actually connected a lot of dots and answered a lot of questions I‚Äôve had for years. The best part is the references they give you just Incase you feel the need to find more help. Mental health is very important, yet it seems so hard to find the right help. This is very affordable compared to others, and you get a lot more than a quiz. Learning yourself, in my opinion, is the first step. I‚Äôve already shared the app with two people and it hasn‚Äôt been 24hrs yet."
5,Mrrrrt,"I‚Äôve noticed some memory and focusing loss over the last few years. This is an easy way to keep my brain active as an adult, and I feel much better about applying myself cognitively, as opposed to just looking at social media. The games are short, fun and sometimes challenging. I feel that this app does a great job with variety, to keep your entire brain stimulated. A little pricey, but the sale helped make the decision to give it a chance much easier. All in all, great thus far."
1,Kumo MNK,"How could something free be a scam? How about they are currently trying to charge me a premium subscription when I cancelled before the free trial was over by a day. I don‚Äôt have enough money on that card so the 5 charges in 2 days have all been declined.  For me, my free trial was going to renew into a premium subscription on July 28 but I cancelled the free trial on July 27 at 11:00pm because I wasn‚Äôt sure if cancellation would lock me out or not. Now, my subscriptions say that it actually expired August 4th and they are only trying to charge me now on August 6th-7th every few hours. I don‚Äôt have money, leave me alone and correct this please. I thought someone scraped my card before I found the charge I didn‚Äôt even know existed beforehand."
3,Kg000,"I really like the app but it glitches. Especially candy sort. It worked fine until I reached a certain level then the very last move would take forever to register and move onto the next level. Currently at level 1344 and when I select to play, the screen is blank. Every other game is able to be played except this one. I‚Äôd like a refund but my message in regards to the glitch seems to have gone unanswered so not sure how to get a refund. I really would have loved to give this 5 stars but the glitches and unresponsiveness in regards to such warrants 3 stars."
3,skelly doggo,"Hello, so this app is fun. It‚Äôs great very simple. Keeps me engaged and has challenging but simple games.  I think it could be so much better if it  A stopped shoving the subscription in my face after I do anything. I take a test and can‚Äôt see the results because I need to pay to see it.  and B stopped having so many ads.  Now I do understand that the people who make this app need to be paid and I‚Äôm thankful for that but I think the fact it‚Äôs a subscription is terrible. Weekly none the less and I understand it‚Äôs 7 dollars a week so you want to buy a whole year for only 28 dollars but why not make it a one time payment. Make your app for actual money.   No one wants to pay a subscription along with their a million other subscripts.   It‚Äôs just very annoying. Either push the ads after I don‚Äôt want to pay for the subscription and just make me watch an ad for results or make your app worth money up front.  Very annoying not worth it."
5,Dilllyyy,"This is an awesome app for anybody who likes to test their mental speed and intelligence. It comes with many games that cater to any weaknesses you may have. It also has multiple IQ and personality tests as a bonus to see where you rank. Although the IQ test isn‚Äôt clinical standard, it‚Äôs a good benchmark and shows you where you rank amongst other people your age who have taken it. I like the fact that the games are fun and interactive but you can tell that they‚Äôre testing specific skills that are useful in day to day life!"
5,nathanrosas18,"I realized I‚Äôve have always been attracted to more intelligent apps. I‚Äôve always been a nerd and will most likely always be one. Impulse helps to ground my mind in the wake of my busy schedule not including my 2 kids under 5. Impulse reminds me when I‚Äôm doing well and when I‚Äôm not doing well. And I look at the days Im doing well very closely to find out why I‚Äôm not doing well. This way I can be more consistent and flourish to new heights I could only dream of. Thank you, for creating a very well rounded app for people like me."
5,drmcmur,"Just did the update July 1. Game of Candy Sort won‚Äôt even open.  I love playing your games but the glitch prior to this one where the Candy Sort wouldn‚Äôt close out for 30 seconds after attempting to place the last ball was an issue. I was hoping it was getting fixed in this new update. I‚Äôll continue to wait because I really like your product but I am paying for the Premium service and the games I like, I can‚Äôt play adequately."
5,Hutchweez,"I have Multiple Sclerosis & one of the symptoms is a decline in cognition.  I‚Äôve tried several apps with ‚Äúgames‚Äù to try to help alleviate the decline, but none kept me interested (& usually just made me feel more frustrated than accomplished).  But I *look FORWARD* to the daily training on the Impulse app!  It switches up the tests randomly every day, so I‚Äôm not just playing the same games I already KNOW I‚Äôm ‚Äúgood at‚Äù!  And I love that I can play ANY of the games whenever I want (not just in the daily).  This is MY FAVORITE app!!! üëçüèªüëçüèª"
5,MissMalachite,"I enjoy this app so far. I like the different games they offer to not only challenge your brain and keep you sharp, but also to help unwind your mind. I personally love that I can shut down all my thoughts and overwhelms of the day and just focus on the games they provide you. I also like the personality quizzes and different types of tests they give you. A fun way to get some insight into your mind and personality, why you are the way you are, and how to work on personal growth."
5,Tommiegirl75,I have been on a learning journey for a few years well honestly my whole life. But very recently I‚Äôve been feeling mental fog even amidst my my learning endeavors. I‚Äôm new to Impulse and right from the beginning these games have started to let me navigate through the fog to my eventual goal of stars and moonlight (I‚Äôm a night person). The app does this in clever ways to wake my foggy brain up and improve my cognitive abilities. Try it out for yourself; I think it‚Äôs worth the price of admission so to speak.
5,Jazsmal,"I like impulse because when I use the app it opens my mind, especially when my mind is just thinking of or stuck on one subject in school. When I go to a math class I try to play for at least 20mins before math, it helps to pay attention to things out of the norm (when everyone sees black and white, I see it to but in color so I can see in depth differences) one of the best apps to expand mental thoughts. Look for differences and make a difference to identify what‚Äôs different to make a difference."
2,wasabipea13,"First off, I have no problem paying for an app that I‚Äôll use. With that said, I downloaded the Impulse app and was still experimenting during my 3-day trial period when I was sent a discounted rate offer. Figured the rate would be applied after my 3-day trial ended (so I‚Äôd have some time to figure out if I‚Äôd use it) so I accepted the offer and was charged immediately. Didn‚Äôt feel like groveling to Apple for a refund so I‚Äôm out 29 bucks for something I‚Äôm not using. I might contact Apple anyway because yea I‚Äôm annoyed. Just buyer beware on that.  Gave it two stars because I guess it‚Äôs a decent time waster if you have the time, which I don‚Äôt."
4,pamelilla816,I have no issue it was just the sort by color one I didn‚Äôt like at first and got one wrong because I thought I had to drag it into the right trash not click on the trash so that‚Äôs why I got it wrong but other to that I have no issue with it. I do like it. And look  I understand the creator charges because they need money but if this is to improve someone‚Äôs memory and help them thru what they‚Äôve been through it should be free because you never know if what they‚Äôve been through has caused them to not be able to work.
5,SlayqueenHGCüëëüíÖ,"Hey! So if ur seeing this you should know this app is pretty good üíØ if you have some mental math problems like me then you should this app and I lik how it pushes you to not lose your streak so you can remember so if you think your not smart or want to get your memory better you should try this app there's:  math audit, sort trash, candy sort, general IQ test, and more so you should try this app and if you don't like it you can always delete it so yeah! Thx for reading!"
5,Bamcar1,"I have been enjoying Impuse game which is a fun way to keep my brain active and was disappointed that it logged me out recently when I went into the game.  I sent a request for help to see if there was a way to log back in and get my progress restored so that I was not starting over at level 1. I was very pleased to receive a quick response to help me restore my progress. Today I was successfully able to restore my progress. Great game, great support!"
1,bubbaj9,"I really enjoy playing the candy sort game along with my daily training. The candy sort game would pause/lock up at a certain point during the game, it would eventually start working again after maybe 30 seconds. Every time I download an update I think great they finally fixed the problem. Nope, the same game just freezes up at a different point each time.   I‚Äôm fully expecting the developers response to be the same response they always give. Thank you for your feedback we are committed to continuing to improve the app. Please just fix the problem, I don‚Äôt need your carbon copy response that is always given. I am very, very close to deleting this app‚Ä¶.."
5,treevillage,"For one: I will press on something and it will not register that I pressed it. Two: the levels get insanely difficult and near impossible to do. Why isn‚Äôt there a colorblind option for sort the trash? How are people supposed to sort them so quickly if they can‚Äôt see the color difference as well and can‚Äôt tell what material it is? Match the pair, treasure hunt, and the other focus and working memory games are the bane of my existence"
1,Ed 4568928400,"I impulsively downloaded this after being clickbaited by their own ad on IG. It was an info graph showing different ADHD subtypes based on taking their test. It‚Äôs an expensive app subscription, so I signed up for the free trial. Then I spent my valuable time and energy taking the test. At the end they REQUIRE YOU TO PAY to see the test result.  The company boasts about how many millions of users they have, yet are so profit oriented (aka greedy) that they try to pull every trick to get your money. Now I‚Äôm spending even more of my time and energy writing this in hopes to save you from wasting your time and money with this ironically named Impulse app. There are plenty of free and/or better resources for people who want to improve their brains or ADHD."
5,kayne carlson,"I‚Äôve enjoyed every little game that this app has as ‚Äútraining‚Äù. It‚Äôs severely great training for the brain because as you train your brain, you get to keep it more so stress free because the ‚Äútraining‚Äù is just calm and relatively easy games. Highly recommend this app.   All of this coming from a man who died twice in under 6 months was put in a coma and started over from the mental age of zero. My brain is back workin as it should and that‚Äôs because of games like this."
5,designhomeexplayer,"I have been struggling with post partum anxiety and found a big difference since using this app‚Ä¶ I feel so much better, I sleep better, and starting to feel like myself again. I also play these games instead of doom scrolling on social media which I think was contributing to my anxiety. Love the puzzles and bonus levels! Only feedback I have is would like more bonus levels and the option to only play the bonus levels in the puzzle section."
5,hollyvrobinson,I really enjoy this app. I immediately downloaded after reading reviews. I ended up subscribing after playing a couple games. I work in a high pace environment and sometimes just need a distraction that causes me to focus on something else and this app is just the right thing! I‚Äôve given myself a goal to complete 5 minutes worth of games each day and it‚Äôs already helped me center myself during stressful days by allowing me to focus on the game. I‚Äôm really happy I gave it a try.
5,Furrybooger,"I don‚Äôt usually review apps, but this one is different. Recently, I haven‚Äôt been able to read or stimulate my brain as much as I‚Äôd like to. I clicked on the ad for this app by accident and I ended up enjoying the games. The games are really fun and they allow me to think harder as I progress. Not only does this provide enjoyment, but it‚Äôs sharpening my ability to think and recall what task I‚Äôm in the process of doing. For any of you who want an enjoyable and stimulating game, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this one to anyone."
5,Tipstein,"Exactly the kind of exercises I was looking for!  After reading the reviews, I‚Äôm glad I dove right in and skipped having to manage through the ads.  Being able to fly though all kinds of activities that help improve focus, attention, memory, while minimizing distraction is exactly why I got the app.  Even more, I love how each game/puzzle/activity highlights what I‚Äôm working on/improving.  Overall, this is such a fun productive time killer‚Ä¶.rare to find one with this much variety and challenge."
5,ghfgrbbgbv,"Love this it‚Äôs one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. It gives you three different games to help your brain It‚Äôs so good. It took me so short of a time to learn how to work this app and it took me about like 14 seconds to learn how to do this app and it was so good that I would recommend it to anyone in the world like I would, I can‚Äôt even say anything I would recommend it to anyone in this world right now. I can‚Äôt say anything bad about it because it‚Äôs one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever use to shop in my brain."
1,dgreg2256,Could be a great app and help with life but the entire first 15min I used it all it did was try to get me to pay rather then let me enjoy the free 3 days. I can tell you in that 15 min I liked what it offered but the fact they don‚Äôt hold true to the offer and allow you to see why their app maybe great tells me they don‚Äôt believe in the product they are offering and they would rather you spend the $6.99 so they get your money knowing you‚Äôll be cancelling it soon after. Although I contemplated serval times on taking the offer the pressure of the sale made this app less and less attractive. So I cancelled my subscription within 15 min and decided not to even finish the 3 free days and deleted it.
1,BrooksJRN,I have reached out multiple times because there is one game that I like to play and it will NOT LOAD. I have received zero response after reaching out via email and also thru the website. Very frustrated - I would love a refund but no one will respond.  They have responded and the fix will be in the next update.  I still stand by the awful response and service.  This took well over a month for them to respond.  I fixed my issue by deleting the app - therefore deleting all of the work I had saved including the tests.  The game did work after this work around.  I am left to think they are backlogged because they don‚Äôt have enough manpower to keep up with reviews.  Hire some more help.
3,Mel-batoast77,"Ok so maybe the app deserves a bit more than 3 stars. But I have a complaint. The crossword puzzle game is not challenging enough. They give very elementary words, and it happens over and over again, 3 and 4 letter words all the way up to Level 61, and many repeated each game. How does that help my brain? No, most of the larger words I think of are not on the puzzle, so even though I get points for them, it‚Äôs just frustrating to have an app that is mostly catered more to adults (and/or teens) to be using such low-level vocabulary 60 levels in. Come on guys. You can do better."
3,Dvall027,"Once you've made it past the pay walls, the app is pretty decent, and games are entertaining. But after a while you begin to notice lots a bugs and issue that could be fixed. I've reported several bugs and issues in the apps like finishing levels and not receiving credit for them, or games that tell you are are out of moves being incorrect, it actually not leading you to a dead end. All things I've left as feedback but honestly don't expect the developers to ever look at. They made a cash cow, and likely don't care to fix anything."
5,HappySunflower1!,"I have only been using this app for a few days, but it really has allowed me to get to my own knowledge better. The games are really fun, yet effective.    I did have some trouble with a few of the games, but I probably just didn‚Äôt understand the directions correctly.    The quiz‚Äôs that are available are awesome, as well. They had helped me gain a better understanding of what goes on in my head.    Other than that, this app is amazing and had me starting my day feeling good.    Now take in mind I have the free version of this app, yet it still allows you just as much availability than the yearly/weekly version does. There is a free trial which I think is great for those who want to try out the app without having to pay if they don‚Äôt like it.    I strongly recommend this app if you are looking for something to stretch your knowledge!!!"
3,ShanaDF,"I am on 110 day streak with the daily training. So safe to say I‚Äôve been at it long enough to give this feedback. While most of the training games are good and even fun, there are some boring ones (pass the ball, arrows direction). While an app having a few boring games is to be expected, there aren‚Äôt enough total games in rotation to keep me wanting to come back.    Would love to see at least 2-3x more games added for the daily workouts. Otherwise this isn‚Äôt worth paying for a year subscription because you‚Äôll be bored within a couple of months."
5,Yoni Rae,"Dementia runs in my family - both on the maternal and paternal side - so I‚Äôm always looking for ways to keep my mind sharp. I heard about Impulse and decided to give it a try. I‚Äôm so very glad I did! The games (exercises) are fun to play, more challenging the further you go along and short enough to where you‚Äôre not easily bored. I‚Äôve recommended this app to several friends and family members. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and engaging way to test your cognitive skills on a daily basis, download Impulse!"
3,irosnhdfjjjdm,"The games are fun and I feel like they are good for brain exercise but you will literally be asked to buy a subscription dozens of times as there are paywalls everywhere. The worst is that if you take a test, they will not tell you you have to pay for the results until you are done. That to me is downright cruel. Also, you will watch tons of ads. I wish they would make free membership more enjoyable as I am fine it‚Äôs limited use and watching ads, but I don‚Äôt understand why the don‚Äôt just make you pay from the start if they want your money so bad."
5,shears1234,"It is worth every penny! The games are fun and challenging. It is definitely sharpened my brain, even lowering anxiety. This review actually sounds like a paid review or a bit review, I know. But it‚Äôs not. This app is actually, truly that helpful. If you have brain fog, anxiety, or trouble remembering things, USE THIS APP. Your brain will absolutely improve. I especially love the encouragement it gives if I don‚Äôt do well on a challenge. The better you get at challenges, the harder they get, keeping you sharp! Five stars."
1,ThisGuyThatEats,"The app offers you a free trial that will convert to a paid subscription at the end of 3 days. However, during this ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù you are able to take tests, but not read the results of the tests WITHOUT PAYING. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense, since I‚Äôm already subscribed. Yes, my payment is deferred, but the app forced me to subscribe to take the tests‚Ä¶ a subscription that will auto-charge me at the end of my ‚Äúfree trial.‚Äù So, essentially, they lure you into a subscription you must cancel with 0 benefit. You can take the tests, but not see the results. Cool. Kind of scummy if you ask me. Now I have to take time out of my day cancelling the useless trial subscription (that will charge me if I don‚Äôt) without ever having gotten to try the app."
5,iProjectSaturn,"Impulsive is a pretty fun brain training game that most of the time I don‚Äôt realize is a brain training game. Most of the mini games are pretty challenging but make you really think(my personal favorite being the 1 line game.) mini flex, but I took an iq test and it said it was 125 which I'm pretty happy about seeing as I‚Äôm still relatively young compared to others with that iq. Overall, I really like the game and I recommend it to anyone who has too much free time and wastes it on social media."
5,1Matthew2,"I was looking to distract my inward ego from rambling on stressing me out over quite literally nothing.   These games allow me to move past thoughts and allow them time to cool down while distracting me.   I‚Äôve also been reading, journaling, going to therapy, working out, and trying to be more in touch with how the mind works and being present. There‚Äôs not always time to sit down and meditate so this app is my next level of simple distraction but also allowing me to continually stretch my brain."
3,The.rapist.Shane,"Look, it‚Äôs actually one of the better or best brain training apps. Fun, user friendly, extremely informative, content other apps lack. This would be 5 stars but I was under the impression that this was free, NOPE! Too bad though I like it. Especially how in-depth the information provided is, such as how the specific parts of the brain & their function. Also enjoyed how I was shown the % of ‚Äúmy peers‚Äù which I scored higher than after each activity/game.  Again too bad I was tricked into downloading it. Though it may be worth purchasing, if it were as one time fee, NOT A DANG SUBSCRIPTION!!!!"
5,Edana-4476,I‚Äôm one of those people that rarely leaves reviews and I never ever purchase anything. But I bought this game and I‚Äôm glad I did. My father died from dementia and keeping my brain as sharp as possible is important. This is the most detailed and professional app I‚Äôve ever seen. You‚Äôll never get bored! They update it to keep it going with more added games.  P.s please bring back the original colors for candy sort. The colorblind option was a lifesaver but the new colors are very hard to recognize
5,ChiefKatyKat,"I just started using this app a couple days ago and has been great so far!   Trying to work in a simple and attainable way to work my brain out a bit more.    The games are fun and I love the way you can customize your goals.   I have been doing 10 minutes a day which I find to be achieve able but there are others options with 20 minutes a day or even 5.   I like the additional puzzles, tests and games also.   Super cool and I‚Äôm trying to convince my husband to get it."
5,Mary_Kate1,"I love this app. It has been a very good experience so far and it helps me challenge and exercise my brain and excel in levels and items that seem very simple about having a meaningful hit in your brain. It‚Äôs been very amazing so far and I really would like if it was like show one thing for free like my IQ or if I have like the tests but like overall, it is better than great and I hope everyone who sees it might wanna get it cause whenever I see it oh my God this looks so cool."
5,nadiiamiller,"It‚Äôs an awesome app with regular updates and you can do a one time forever purchase it‚Äôs incredible how well they keep up their product. Just excellent.  I love the games, they are not just good for your brain, they are fun and entertaining, I tried a few apps and this one is best, been using it for more than a year now. I have 0 complaints. This app is one of my valued possessions that is absolutely totally worth the money."
1,bricrv,"The app is a wonderful addition for those who want to grow in mental capacity, focus, and intellect. It features fun features and games to work with. My only issue with the app has been the charge for a membership I cancelled prior to the membership trial ending and the lack of assistance regarding it. I had selected to end the membership early and had even doublechecked it again after to ensure further issues. Unfortunately, following the renewal date, it did charge me anyways. After reaching out to both Apple and the app regarding the charge, I haven‚Äôt received further assistance. With the lack of support or of any response, I prefer and recommend to utilize another app option instead."
4,jackrules1,"So far the exercises appear to target the brain centers responsible for the integration of higher level functions unique to humans. Language skills accomplish the full utilization of all brain segments. These exercises are empirically based science research proven to stimulate and practice skills helpful to an active mind. I am not sure yet how the working memory, focus, and anxiety reduction exercises will mimic the more complex language arts performance improvement approach. I do look forward to practicing the building block skills towards making strides in the mind longevity process."
4,just a teen gal,"I love this app i bought a year subscription because I use it so much. Only complaint is on the candy sort game if you add a tube to solve, it shows up as grey or not completed. Then when you reopen the app, it will take you to the grey levels even if you‚Äôre hundreds of levels past. And if you go to complete that grey level, it doesn‚Äôt take you to the next grey level, it will just take you to the next level even if you completed it and it‚Äôs too much scrolling"
5,krisha1974,this is a fine game or to put it more bluntly games. I am believing that there are more than one game due to the fact that our mind needs several different ideas at bedtime for your mind to have several different items or ideas to think so your mind does not get stuck on just one thing so that idea does not get stuck and keeps us up at night. I believe that is the excellence of this app. Really Wise Even if at first you do not understand this.
5,unique brim,these games are fun to play easy to get sucked into and there‚Äôs is a variety of games to choose from the word guess game was soooo difficult but I was persistent and ended up getting the hang of it ! I recommend this app bc it‚Äôs a great way to get that daily brain exercise! The game will even give u a personalized set of daily brain teasers‚Ä¶(I am not consistent enough to actually make it apart of my schedule)  but there is a reminder option u can customize to any set time to remind you !
5,Southern Texas Carolina,"I added Impulse to my daily schedule to keep my brain sharp. The brain is a muscle and like our bodies we need to exercise it. The way I do it is by the practice techniques provided in this app. Try drinking more water as well so you can keep your muscle hydrated. In doing so, you‚Äôll notice the change and you‚Äôll feel the power and potential you have by trying this app and drinking a little more water. üí™üèªüéì‚ú®üôåüèª. Download the app. You won‚Äôt regret it. -SouthernTexasCarolina"
3,Bdnsnsns,I like the app and the games. I really just likes the games and haven‚Äôt bothered with anything else. Soooo many ads. For the pop-up to pay $4.99 to remove ads and thought it was a good deal. Only to find out it was just for that one group. I wouldn‚Äôt have paid if I knew that. Thought it was for the whole app. There are a lot of levels but I would have at minimum chosen a different game to pay for. Now I have to play Connect the dots (which is only 300 levels). I would have chosen at least one with more levels and that I enjoyed more.
5,DrBones3345 (roblox name),"When I first got the game, it ask you questions about your goals you want to chose and mind set. They have games you can play that will keep you sharp, my favorite in my opinion is the marble sort. There also test to find your personality test, ADHD test, IQ, and more.  I‚Äôm always trying to beat my highest streak and it‚Äôs really fun to play while keeping your mind sharp with puzzles that get challenging as you level, I definitely recommend this"
4,Nidhikalaria,"I was feeling focused and less distracted from my day to day thoughts due to this game so I am grateful to have come across this and it was quite fun to play but it can be free for users instead of having it paid for fun, as I sensed the free version was purposely made very easy to force the users to buy the paid version to enjoy the real fun of this game.  Thought of sharing my personal insight on this experience but at the end I am no one to tell you how to run your app so thanks for giving me the little fun I had in the free version üôèüèº‚úåüèª"
3,CareBear05021988,"YOU GUYS... you cannot just delete an app that you have subscribed to and think it goes away... you have to actually go to subscriptions and cancel the subscription before the free trial period ends if that‚Äôs what you choose to do.   Anyway I downloaded this for the tower of Hanoi game. My complaint is that at level 14, it doesn‚Äôt move quickly when you tap it and instead it auto moves and you have to wait almost a minute to move the ring from one spot to another. This doesn‚Äôt make sense with a timed game. I would like to get to level 30 but can‚Äôt if it‚Äôs gonna be this slow. Is it a glitch?"
4,Miss Mari elle,"I love this game. It has a great selection of games and they are fun to play. My only gripe is that it does freeze sometimes and the game Words Crossword cheats. I‚Äôll add a correct word and it will not add it to the crossword part, which messes up how to figure out other words. It‚Äôs not until you complete the second to last word it adds the word you already did and says you won. It‚Äôs very frustrating. But other than that the game is worth every penny. The glitch needs to be fixed that‚Äôs why I only gave 5 stars."
5,CooperZajac,"I‚Äôve only had this for a couple days now but I like it enough to leave a review. You do have to pay for it but I found it was cheap enough to be worth it especially if you really want to improve your mental health. I have access to games, quizzes, and reports to track my progress which I find super helpful. I just do around 5 minutes of activities per day which has helped me stay consistent so far. Recommend forsure!"
5,Baby kams mama09,"I‚Äôve been using Impulse for a few weeks, and it‚Äôs quickly become a favorite. The variety of brain-training games and exercises are engaging and challenging, making it easy to stay consistent with daily practice. The app‚Äôs progress tracking is a great motivator, showing how my cognitive skills are improving over time. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to keep their mind sharp with just a few minutes a day. Highly recommend!"
5,Jcowen0912,"Not only has it improved some of my executive functioning skills, including my working memory and attention, but I also find it to be extremely addictive, and I look forward to it every day. there‚Äôs one game called fresh item I believe, in which they add a new item of clothing and you have to decide if it‚Äôs new or not and I‚Äôve literally gone from horrible to 100% every time. So that skill has completely improved. it‚Äôs worth your time."
5,Enzerubebitakkun,I like how straightforward these games are! They don‚Äôt feel as stressful as other brain training games - I think it might be because there isn‚Äôt an intense timer countdown like others have.  It‚Äôs super fun and I can feel my brain muscles getting stretched!  If you do the free route - there are little ads that play but they‚Äôre SHORT so it‚Äôs not too disrupting and I‚Äôm happy to support the devs that way :) I like these games much better than the Lumosity games I used to pay for.
5,recmond,"I have recently been trying to improve the function and health of my brain. After years of trauma and drug/alcohol abuse, I‚Äôve been having a hard time having mental clarity. My mind doesn‚Äôt work the way it used to but this app has already been helping a lot! I can physically feel my brain feel better as I do the exorcises. Using this app along with therapy, reading, eating healthy, being physically active and living a sober life has been changing my life for the best!"
1,Morganikara,"I downloaded this app thinking it would be pretty cool to train my brain, but alas the free 3-day trial doesn‚Äôt allow you to access any of the really cool features. Are you so unsure of the value of this app that you must hook people into giving you money before allowing access? That perspective isn‚Äôt for me. Deleting.  UPDATE:  Received a response from developer asking for suggestions to improve this app.   I would think my suggestion was more than obvious in my original review.   As usual, the response isn‚Äôt helpful, rather it is merely lip service so they can show they do respond to feedback in a timely manner.   Some response is good, but responses should be evaluated for relevance and quality as well as timeliness!"
5,lisamaxout,The fact that I won a discounted rate to continue the services for a year for only $.99 cents was AMAZING! I thank God for this Mental Game because it truly helped me during a time where I needed it the most! It helps me to stay focused and pay great attention to detail. It helps with your math skills and really improved my speech. I can take the things I learned from this game and use it in real life situations without even realizing it. So thank you to the creators of this fun and fulfilling game.
2,Dc?,"I did the trial, games were fun so I paid for a week subscription.  I didn‚Äôt play enough to warrant continuing the subscription so I cancelled after the week. OMG the ads were nonstop.  Some of the ads have very adult themes which is odd for an app with a 4+ age rating (parents beware).  You can play a game that takes 15 seconds then have to wait through a 30 second ad for the next game.  Most sessions are 3 games long, so you have about 90 seconds of ads for 45 seconds to a minute of gameplay.  It became so frustrating I finally gave up.  Not worth the overall cost in my opinion for a phone game."
2,notdyeana,I‚Äôve only had the app for a few days and only got it because I had a gift card. I bought the year membership but I‚Äôve yet to see if it‚Äôll be worth it to pay for that long since I‚Äôve only had it for about 5 days. So far though it‚Äôs been good and I think I may redeem next year (we‚Äôll see). There‚Äôs a variety of tests and apps that seem worth it enough.  Update: the touch sensitivity is weird and unresponsive sometimes. I‚Äôll be dragging my finger across the screen and the touch won‚Äôt register. It‚Äôs frustrating because it‚Äôll make me restart sometimes. I‚Äôm going to check my phone settings but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what it is.
5,THANKS PJ,"I like this app vm, the more you do the more you unlock, spending time on your phone in this way takes away the guilt of brain rot hours you‚Äôd usually spend just scrolling. It‚Äôs a cool setup, i just honestly wish the streak was more forgiving bc i might miss a day and have to start all the way over but i guess that‚Äôs the point In the end Good for adhd just have to give it a try after day 1 bc you have to unlock stuff at first and then you have a bunch of games all of a sudden"
1,Olsotm0813,It‚Äôs such a scam. I love puzzle games and saw an add for this so I figured I‚Äôd give it a try.  It says 3 days free trial. It locked up in a day and started charging me. Not only does it automatically charge the $9.99 but there‚Äôs nothing in app to stop it. I deleted the app and it kept trying to charge me. It also charges on a weekly basis. $9.99 but there‚Äôs an option for $9.99 a month also. It defaults to charging you every week for the same amount it would be a month. It‚Äôs very deceptive and a scam. I can‚Äôt believe Apple would let this happen. Thankfully I had this on a reloadable card. If not they would of easily gotten the $9.99 a week for a few weeks before I noticed. Don‚Äôt trust them with your info and don‚Äôt waste your time on this.
5,XerionFire,"As someone who sometimes wonders where they‚Äôre at with their Mind itself, this really helps you get a deeper understanding of what you need help with, wether it be as simple as mental math, or as deep and complex to what kind of Trauma Response you are, this Makes it Super Fun to Challenge Your Brain and keep you on your Toes! Challenging your Brain is something people these days aren‚Äôt doing anymore, Lets stop being comfortable with where we are and Challenge Ourselves! Great Job Developers!"
5,J. Simpleton,"I have spent at least 5 minutes a day on impulse every day for the last 6 months, and I can honestly say the short games have helped to keep my mind sharp and quick. The games are simple exercises and not very difficult at all, but when done consistently over a period of time the results will show. Definitely worth it and I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to improve their thinking and mental processing speed."
2,TaurusMoon91,"I absolutely love this app, these are the types of games I most enjoy. However, ever since I upgraded to the pro version I have to play some levels of candy sort multiple times for it to truly save it as being done. There seems to be no reasoning behind it either as it has nothing to do with if I use a power up or not. So if I play and beat multiple levels in a session, next time I go to play random levels throughout that previous session will be undone and I will have to do them again. You can‚Äôt skip levels so I‚Äôm not even sure how this glitch is possible but it‚Äôs certainly frustrating."
4,andooley,"As with most brain training apps that charge for a subscription, this one is ad-filled without payment. I will say though...that the app's ""guide"" WILL let you know how to fast forward thru the ad to make it as time efficient as possible. Personally, still running app for free, I appreciate the stats offered after each game- telling you how well you do in comparison to peers. Other tests/quizzes are also offered; however, you don't get an official report or analysis of your scores unless you opt in for payment"
3,Romper2.0,"Excellent games that were very enjoyable to play! Fun for my brain and good for so many reasons. But I deleted the app. Every 30 seconds an add would play. After I finished one round of a game or exercise, an add would show up. I found myself getting extremely frustrated and very little benefit from the game/exercise. I was spending more time watching adds than participating in the app.   I get the app needs to make money‚Ä¶but there are plenty of other free versions that allow for longer play inbetween adds. I‚Äôve never used an app that played so many adds!"
4,BAJDJEBXBSJSJX,"It was good but it killed my braincell from trying to figure out how to put the blocks in number order. My head was smoking like Patrick‚Äôs head when he thinks. I recommend this app if yu want to slowly kill your braincells and then rebuild them bigger, better, and stronger but have a head the size of a melon. I really liked how good this app kills braincells. Also my super happy grandma died trying to help. And since I was highly addicted to the game I did not eat for 4 days but I did get a good grade on one of my tests. I feel like this is one of those mind control apps tbh."
5,Chicks That Print,"When you hear the word IQ, you can‚Äôt help but wonder right? I was impressed with the variety of tests, the levels of accomplishments, and the ease of choosing what appeals to you. My husband and I actually were competing which was good for some laughs and bragging rights. I am also going to share with a family member that uses mental games to help keep her mind active as she ages. I‚Äôm impressed and highly recommend you give it a try - they offer a 3 day trial free too!"
5,Angel_10213819001456!,"So I am very terrible at math and have tried different apps to help me improve but nothing really worked and I‚Äôm the type of person when I am not interested in something I‚Äôm NOT into it like there is no effort I basically don‚Äôt give a crap. This app has different games that helps you improve your thinking, math, memory skills and the games that it proves is fun and something‚Äôs frustrating but I am willing to accept the challenge. Download this app now!"
5,crazycaeüçì,In class I used to not be able to focus on a single thing and would always be lost because of ongoing conversations or noises from the class next door or walking/running down the hall we have this kid that always runs around screaming and running into classrooms I‚Äôve been able to ignore that better in just two days I enjoy the impulse games I have many puzzle games to help after impulse makes changes.
5,The Bynum,"I really like this app. I like that explains the games and why they created them. They are simultaneously simultaneously challenging. After each game it shows how you did in conjunction with others who played the same game.  Set up is super easy and very customizable to the user. I‚Äôm going to purchase it for my phone for life instead of a monthly subscription. And having a brain injury myself, this is exactly what I need to help train my brain and keep it strong."
1,Mehdi.Y,"They let you download it for free, but implicitly activate the subscription option. If you do not explicitly turn it off in a short time they will charge you without any further notification. In their terms of service, they mention an unsubscribe button in their website which I could never found (perhaps it doesn‚Äôt exist), so the only possible option is to send an email to unsubscribe you! I did send an email requesting to be unsubscribed and refund a few hours after I realized they have charged me without my consent, but no response yet!  Please report this to Apple Support, every app must keep it clear and clean otherwise it is a scam!"
5,UfzmGkgGkvkslhxzlhzlzlzzhlb,"l just downloaded and I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied. The cost is like $20 for a whole year worth of training, personalized tests, and puzzles. It‚Äôs definitely worth the money because it‚Äôs interactive, kid friendly, has in tests which has been my favorite so far. the only things i‚Äôm worried about is after finishing the thousands upon thousands of puzzles i hope i‚Äôm still able to find other things to do in the app but that would take years"
5,Brittsta143,"Very fun and intriguing games to sharpen your mind. Have honestly been looking for something like this for years just couldn‚Äôt think of a way to word exactly what I was looking for aside from ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù lol. Seriously contemplating on doing the yearly version if it happens to pop up again as an offer lol DOWNLOAD IT & do the 3 day trial :) you won‚Äôt be disappointed, wish trial was longer but I know that‚Äôs exactly how they get ya to go premium haha it‚Äôs Awesome just get it !"
2,Dorksterrr,"The free trial is far from free. In the ten minutes I used the app I was bombarded with three different attempts to get me to ‚Äúpay now.‚Äù You get a sneak peak of your results, with a lengthy scheme to get you to fork over a one-time payment of $28. Don‚Äôt worry, though. This is a .92% (92%??) discount. The archetype test has some grammatical errors, repeat questions, and is for entertainment purposes only (I‚Äôm fine with that). I didn‚Äôt expect it to be standardized, norm-referenced caliber tests. But for 7 bucks A WEEK I‚Äôd want better than click bait with ads and other nonsense. Bottom line: it‚Äôs a free trial that‚Äôs not free and purely click bait. Thankfully, Apple makes subscription canceling easy."
5,Kkwil,Saw an ad for this app on Facebook. I enjoy puzzles and I like that there is so much you can chose from. You‚Äôre not forced to do one or two things until you unlock something or pay something. The price per year is very reasonable too in my opinion. The games are not overwhelming. Just the right amount of time and challenge to make you feel satisfied when you beat a level. Looking forward to using this app more.
5,Skyylarr94,"I downloaded this app when I was having really bad anxiety. Nothing I could do would help my anxiety so I knew I needed a distraction. I downloaded this app and it immediately became one of my favorite apps. It‚Äôs fun, it has SO MANY LEVELS!!! And it has a variety of games, tests, puzzles, etc. and I have never left a review on an app before, but this one is legit so good that I knew I had to leave a review. I love it! As someone who deals with ADHD & anxiety, this is the perfect app and it‚Äôs beneficial in a way as well!"
2,LILLLLLLLLLYYYYY,"I‚Äôve had this app for a little while, and the games are fun, but the things like quizzes and other features seem really fun until you try to get your results. It won‚Äôt tell you your results until you pay them a given amount. I wish they would just lock the quizzes and other features so you don‚Äôt go through all the effort of going through the quiz just to have it ask you to pay. I know they have to make money somehow but it seems a bit deceptive. I know not many people may see this, but I hope it helps someone not to waste their time with this feature like I did."
1,Kennjayyy,"I really hate companies who try to trick people and will never use any app that does that. I see this on instagram and get it for the ADHD type quiz. I sign up for a 3 day free trial to see if I like the app and I take the quiz. After completing the quiz I find out I can pay now to see the results. If they were up front about pricing this would be different but I‚Äôm not okay with this business model. It‚Äôs sketchy and bad business. They would get a lot further with honesty than trying to trick people. I went ahead and canceled my free trial and I‚Äôm deleting this app, when they could have been straight forward and it might have been something I would have liked. Very disappointing."
1,Dhothaka,"I updated the app and when I tried to open it, it got stuck in the loading screen (logo). I‚Äôm using iPhone 15 Pro Max on iOS 17.4.1. Tried quitting the app and restating and restarting the phone. Could fix the issue. Since the app didn‚Äôt load after trying several times I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Once I did that, my purchases got restored, however, all my progress was gone and now I have to start from the beginning. I had completed most of the levels in many games in the past few months. This is extremely annoying and I have to repeat everything from the beginning again. Is there a way to restore my progress??"
5,DMW9283,"Impulse has countless number of different games that challenge your eyesight, mental acuity, innovation thinking, and it challenges the brain which I believe will help with mental disease prevention. One of the best features is that you don‚Äôt need to be connected to the internet. You can play a quick game literally anywhere you are. I highly recommend Impulse if you don‚Äôt have patience to sit for long games or that drag you into some deep story."
5,Xky3,I‚Äôve tried other brain games and they either focus too much on academic topics like math or they don‚Äôt give you the flexibility to keep progressing in areas you prefer. Impulse runs smooth and feels great playing. It makes me want to improve by balancing the feeling of enjoyment while still challenging your brain. Other programs like this eventually make you feel like your working too hard without enough reward.
5,JchsNathan,"Game is awesome and I‚Äôd like to purchase the lifetime offer. But it only appears once during the the initial setup, before I had a chance to try the game out. I‚Äôm not going to drop that kinda money prior to trying it. Now that I have I‚Äôm unable to find the offer anywhere. It‚Äôs not available under iPhone subscriptions menu. Nor can I access it through the app. Please advise how I can purchase the special offer."
5,wast your battery,"In my opinion, I think you should definitely get this app. When I played it I thought I was going to play it for about 2 days and then just quit, but I‚Äôve been playing for a long time now. The games are fun to me, and I feel accomplished once I finish the games. One thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that they don‚Äôt have a lot of free games, that‚Äôs what I just only go on there to do my daily training, but overall this game is a good game. Definitely recommend."
1,AlexMarie522,"Update after developer response: As I indicated in my original review, I was charged immediately after selecting the free trial. This was not a case of me not cancelling in time. I also already contacted the developer at the email address given. I emailed them on the day I was charged for the free trial and have never received a response. If I could give zero stars, I would!    Original Review: I downloaded the app and selected a free trial because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like it or not. I immediately got a confirmation of purchase and a receipt for $6.99 from the App Store‚Ä¶ so much for a free trial! Cancelled and am attempting to get a refund. This is ridiculous and I certainly won‚Äôt be a subscriber after this."
4,New!! Twist on Ancient Game,I am new to Impulse.  It is humbling in some respects.  I thought I would be better with some things but once results are explained the results make sense. I am 62 years old and have Alzheimer‚Äôs in my family so I am concerned about my future. I know training my brain can only be beneficial. I know it‚Äôs recommended to use your brain or lose. This program certainly is tapping into areas I haven‚Äôt used in a while. I can tell the math isn‚Äôt as fast to me as it used to be so I am eager to continue and see how I improve. Thank you!
5,jdujhdhju,They advertise is really good and it helps you a lot. I really think they make you feel good that you accomplished something and your getting better at it each day you do it. You should at least check it out if you don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine but I do. They also give you some lessons if you need help with it and it‚Äôs just fun getting to do games but still learning. This is a really good app yes you may have to pay but I don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs still very fun.
5,Chibitoru-san,"I‚Äôve been struggling with mental arithmetic and processing since leaving college, and have needed to practice to be more effective at my job. This app is both fun, engaging and challenging. The puzzles are unique, and the math challenges are varied in style to use different styles of learning and practicing. I don‚Äôt really like subscriptions, so I just decided to buy the game wholesale at the full price, which is a bit expensive. But to me, worth it because I intend to keep it to practice loving to learn again."
5,5ndyy,"Impulse is a game-changer for personal growth. The app feels like a supportive friend, guiding you through life‚Äôs ups and downs with its well-designed features. It helps you build better habits, stay motivated, and track your progress in a way that feels personal and empowering. The user experience is seamless, making it easy to stay consistent. If you're looking to improve yourself and maintain a positive mindset, Impulse is a must-have on your phone."
1,faith.scholz,"I downloaded the app as I came across it on an ad, wanted to try the FREE trial that popped up as soon as I downloaded it to see if it was worth it. Cancelled the subscription under Apple immediately so that I could make the choice to renew it later if I liked the app. I ended up not feeling the app was necessary so I deleted it off my phone yesterday. Came across a $7 charge for what was supposed to be the free trial today. The free trial wasn‚Äôt supposed to end according to their ad and my subscriptions until November 2nd. So they charged me before the free trial even ended. First app that I‚Äôve come across where the free trial is actually not free. Don‚Äôt recommend. Already put in a request for a refund from Apple."
4,Sarah2377,"I find this to be a nice little app to use at the end of my day, but I have to confess to finding the ‚Äúrankings‚Äù confusing on the progress page. I also can‚Äôt find anywhere that explains them. The game will tell me I‚Äôm in the 99th percentile on a result but then the progress page says I‚Äôm 10%? Is that bottom 10% or top? And if it‚Äôs top, why do they flip it from how they tell you the after the individual games ? Like I said- Confusing.   Otherwise enjoyable games and not a bad deal."
4,AZ|PRO,"This is a great game and all, there are multiple things you can do, to improve your brain skills, and getting premium makes it much better. However I took away one star because of the drawing level. It‚Äôs impossible to get five stars on the rank Artist, since there is only 235 levels I remember there used to be 300. Developers, if you are reading please do something. And some on the riddles are too easy And some of the IQ tests questions are too hard what‚Äôs the highest score you can get"
5,Roblox lover 23 ü•∞,I love it because it‚Äôs fun and it helped me concentrate more and it‚Äôs so fun that I played it for 2 hours straight and the fact that it‚Äôs a game full of learning but it‚Äôs so fun that I just can‚Äôt stop playing it and if you want a membership you can have it but if y or don‚Äôt want it that‚Äôs also fine you can still play the game without and thing saying this is membership that why I totally recommend this game for adults and kids.
5,toongsup,"I can't say this app is affecting my brain on such level or transforming it, but I can say that these games help break or interrupt my patterns. Whether that is doomscrolling or that one addictive game that consumes all of my time (and oftentimes energy because I'm getting worked up over the poor online behavior), this is a nice break from my daily phone routine and habits that no longer serve. I think that in addition to all the brain benefits makes this app top notch."
3,Sofiahahaaa,"I like all the parts of the app that I have access to as a free user, but holy cow there are SO many ads. It‚Äôs really frustrating, and on top of that, I can‚Äôt use the game offline (ie on a plane). I would pay to get rid of ads, but instead of charging 2-5 bucks like most apps, it‚Äôs a subscription service, and I do not want to sign up for another subscription. I‚Äôd much prefer to just be charged once to forever be rid of all of the ads. Sincerely, great game, but the ads make it almost unplayable for me. Maybe Apple Arcade could pick it up?"
5,miss keva,I took a course from the creator in Mindvalley and it changed my life! I couldn‚Äôt afford the app before I‚Äôm so excited it‚Äôs on sale. I‚Äôm so excited about this. I‚Äôm recovering from a severe traumatic brain injury. I was run over by a truck in November 2020 lucky me I survived with no broken bones and only a severe traumatic brain injury. I am recovering well and have refused drugs and listening to the creator of this programs. Wisdom has changed my life sending you love and gratitude.
3,locallapdog,"As the title says i believe this app has a lot of things going for it, i loved the way it was set up and i enjoyed most of the tests. i felt like i was learning a decent amount of myself. however, as most of the world now at days, i saw an ad for this app on tiktok and the test that was shown wasn‚Äôt even on the app. i ended up getting a subscription in a means to attempt to see if new tests would be unlocked and maybe i could take the one that peaked my interest, which was in the ad, but to no avail. i do enjoy the app, but i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be keeping it."
5,Rick-Raft,"""I'm not one to like an app after seeing it is through a payed service"" were my first thoughts, but seeing my spending and that what I usually buy serves me no purpose, I had to give a game that promised improvement for my mind a try! I was not disappointed at all! I've introduced people who could benefit from this type of activity and seeing their smiles as they solve the puzzles and how they become alive as they solve it moves my heart!"
5,DreamGiantEnterprises,"I‚Äôve had a blast adding this app into my daily routine. I always seem to struggle finding something that I can get engaged in and not lose focus, while still keeping my mind sharp. I tried it for free to start, and have since purchased the pro version after a month‚Äôs use. I definitely think it‚Äôs worth the value, and you should give it a try if you want a good brain trainer that you look forward to playing each day!"
1,Charleygrl,"Im not sure how this has so many high reviews. They want you to pay üí∞ for everything from a subscription to paying a one time fee to view my test results. Within 5 minutes they asked for my money in 5 different times for various reasons! Only download if you want to pay money. Even with a 3 day free trial you can take tests or games but must still pay to view results. How can I get on the list of people they bribe for a 5‚≠êÔ∏è review??  It‚Äôs misleading marketing to advertise a 3-day free trial where you think you‚Äôre getting a trail of the paid features, when really it‚Äôs a trial of the free features (so why call it a trial at all?).   Completely Misleading."
5,Scarlet1979,"I‚Äôm shamelessly starting off with a ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said joke,‚Äù but really, there are so many different games, challenges, & self-exploration tests such as IQ and personality, it‚Äôs a little mind boggling. I‚Äôve been using it several times a day for about a week and I haven‚Äôt tried everything within it yet. I feel like I can probably delete all my other puzzle games without regret.   I paid $40 for a lifetime subscription, and I feel it was totally worth it."
5,CookieMonZsteR,I love the test it‚Äôs encouraging to see and test your speed and ability to find out your score in each category. I strive to improve on my own time and that‚Äôs wonderful to feel not pressured to hurry up and get done with the one your doing to straight away do the next ‚Ä¶ you can finish the one your own leave the app and come back to see if it‚Äôs helping AND IT DOES!‚Ä¶ although you do get gentle nudges every now n then to remind you to come play !! Thanks Mary
5,Lolo333$,This is the most interesting game that I‚Äôve ever played! The archetype tests they give are so accurate and the brain training is starting to show in my everyday life. I‚Äôm much more sharp mentally in addition to the adjustment of my psychological and social interaction. I recommend this game to any and everyone who wants to sharpen their mind.  Impulse is truly a jumper cable and accelerator of the brain.  Excellent job to the creators and everyone that had input in making this intellectual game possible.
5,Kaybreanne98,"I try to do this every night before bed, I spend endless hour of scrolling on social media platforms and in reality I would be neglecting myself by not dedicating a couple minutes of my time towards my brain health. This app gives me the confidence that I needed, it keeps me young and intuitive.  The brain exercises this app offers isn‚Äôt just good for the brain but it‚Äôs fun as well! I was asked to do this review but I genuinely feel the way I say I do"
5,10000000 out of 10000000,"As a high school who struggles to focus in class, I‚Äôve found that after using this app I‚Äôve been able to focus better, my memory has improved and I‚Äôve also had reduced head aches. Not only does the app improve only take a couple minutes a day with incredible outcome, they‚Äôve also got fun brain games and puzzles that I‚Äôve struggled with and also find fun and challenging. I strongly suggest downloading for anyone it‚Äôs fun and relaxing."
5,Pixie platinum,"As I have gotten older and having had children, my memory and mental awareness has began to decline. I have tried other apps to keep my mind sharpe but none have kept my interest like impulse. And for the price it‚Äôs hard to say no to. It‚Äôs only a few minutes a day and you can pick the level of commitment. So far so good and I actually enjoy doing the tests and puzzles. Plus it‚Äôs very informative. I have already recommended this app to friends."
5,LadyPooh2018,"I highly recommend this app for brain exercises. It not only helps in retaining information, improving memory, and enhancing logical order but also provides a report of your strengths and weaknesses. This feature allows you to concentrate and practice on areas that need development and improvement. This app is suitable for both adults and teens alike. I would highly recommend this app because of its simplicity and effectiveness."
5,waltuhwite,"I started playing this game about a week ago, and I‚Äôm Already noticing differences. When I woke up today I saw multiple complex math equations floating around my head. Paying no attention to it went down stairs and subconscious made a very well balanced breakfast. Finally when went to the bathroom I looked into the mirror and realized my cranium had grown too twice its original size. I fear that if I continue to play this game I may become to smart for the world to handle."
5,mikepm84,I‚Äôm 39 and have a 4th grade education level on paper and I feel like it‚Äôs true after downloading and using this app it has helped me figure out just where my education level is at and also helps me to understand what I need to try to learn more of and as far as I‚Äôm adhd on paper and very much so it‚Äôs true it has helped me learn to focus and stop and think while I‚Äôm working on the things that they provide for me to learn and focus on in this app
5,Rebecca Joyner,"I am a first time impulse user and I have to say it is the most AMAZING app so far!!! it has really helped me discover some things about myself that I didn‚Äôt even know. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and taking these tests and doing these exercises, strengthen my brain to a level I never knew existed, and knowing which personality you are, your intellectual type, and how to help with your ADHD, anxiety and depression have been some amazing tools! Thank you Impulse, and keep up the good work!"
5,Reignbare,Just another app trying to make a buck with poor content. I downloaded the app for the free trial within a week and they charge my card seven dollars still on the free trial. Trying to cancel subscription is impossible unless you uninstall the app. I‚Äôve reached out to Apple. Hopefully they can stop this grifter sooner rather than later. As this is a app geared towards older people this is basically praying on the elderly shame on you.
5,kaelaconorseanroxx,"in my however many years as an apple user this is the second app i‚Äôve ever paid for (behind minecraft, but 2013 was a strange time) and I LOVE IT!!!!!! upon opening the app for my free trial i was introduced to Candy Sort, otherwise known as the best game i have ever played in all of my life. i haven‚Äôt actually done much on impulse with the other games and quizzes, but candy sort has consumed my life. i was born to sort candy into little test tubes. THIS APP IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
5,i am just mad,"I‚Äôm  60 yr. Old woman. I have noticed my thinking, problem solving and recall have gotten  a lot  slower. I used the APP a while back and in a short time I was able to see improvement. The only problem is I thought everything was OK so I stopped using it and all my brain activities or deficiencies slowly came back. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to keep their minds and brains sharp  try this APP for a week and see for yourself."
5,HP desktop (Ag),"I am 72 and am experiencing some memory lapses. Its scary since my memory used to be almost photographic when learning new things. I can see some improvement after only 2 lessons!üôèüèΩ I am so excited about this app. Please just give it a try, you wont be disappointed. I used to be a professional trainer. I went back to my part time job where things change from hour to hour, literally. This is a godsend. Good lucküëçüèΩ"
3,Kmae888888,"The games are enjoyable and seem truly valuable. However many of them are games you can play in other places for far less the cost. I tried the free trial and felt a little sheepish that I ended up paying for it. What bothers me is that I‚Äôve continued to see advertisements for it, and it advertises games and self tests that aren‚Äôt actually available? Sometimes when I see them I go back to look, but it really seems like they don‚Äôt exist. That feels manipulative in a way that makes me feel worse about getting it for a year."
5,RMG82883,"Impulse is a really good learning game. It helps me learn in a good way. How it helps me learn is by the IQ test, math test, sort the candys and many other test. The people who created this learning game put in time and made it a fun way to make your brain grow. One thing that I don‚Äôt like is how many questions it has, but the questions are what say the results so I can‚Äôt argue with that. So in my opinion Impulse doesn‚Äôt really have any down, there are only ups.üëèüëçüòäüß†!!!"
5,Action lover 1054,"The app obviously contains ads that you have to watch if you don‚Äôt pay a certain subscription or price, but that‚Äôs about every single app nowadays. But you know what, that‚Äôs ok with me. I actually look forward to playing the games that they give me, i‚Äôve only had it for a few days, but i genuinely think it will help overtime. You should download it, because life is short and it‚Äôs just an app haha. You will probably enjoy it   Best of luck to all"
3,smontano,"I was obsessed with this app. I use it to keep memory and mind more sharp. One of my favorite games I reached all the levels, but I was excited because it said new levels coming soon. That was over 3 months ago. I decided to just replay the ones I already did but the screen goes blank and I can't do anything. Hopefully it's a glitch. I tried reaching out to app support and it took me to a page that said, ""The page you are looking for can not be found."" Hopefully it all gets reaolved soon cause it used to be my favorite app."
3,Jessicaleerose,"I purchased the pro version. As someone with ADHD I wanted to see if it could help as advertised. I took all the tests, did the daily challenges for a couple weeks, and enjoyed some of the games.   What was really frustrating was seeing the advertisements and seeing tests only to go into the app and find that they weren‚Äôt there or results weren‚Äôt what showed on the ads. This was especially true in archetype tests.   It is a decent app, but the puzzles and games I played a lot didn‚Äôt really get more challenging and this test issue seems misleading."
5,shaka890,"I bought the 3 month subscription for $25 and have really been enjoying the mini games as well as the test they administer. I was looking for an app/game that works out my brain, this is perfect. Small 5-10 min breaks and I can play a few games. My head ‚Äúhurts‚Äù after some of these games, been a week and I can tell It‚Äôs working. Plus they track your progress and shows how you‚Äôre improving. If you have the spare $ I recommend it."
5,Ricky1027561,"I don‚Äôt like to spend money on apps, but I went ahead and purchased the lifetime membership for Impusle.  A few summers ago I had played this app and I loved it, and I know it helped with my memory and cognitive ability.  When I finally got my new IPad I decided that it was time to do something for myself, and I am so happy that I have.   Instead of watching TV for hours I will exercise my brain and have a sense of accomplishment! :-)"
1,cmgbanana,"Signed up through an offer I saw on Instagram. Tons of upselling and what they don‚Äôt say is how you‚Äôre paying for an auto subscription and not just a one time payment for a block of time.  After 2 days of playing I was more stressed and found it did not help in any advertised ways. What I did find were a bunch of assessments that were eager to diagnose me without providing actual help.  When I went to cancel my expensive subscription: $10/week O.O  I had to jump through so many hoops. It was hard to even find the web url. In fact the sign on process through the web client doesn‚Äôt actually work; I had to use the forgot password flow to get to a email/password login screen so I could cancel my subscription. Please update your app to allow cancellations.  This company is clearly making it difficult to cancel. This product may help some people but I am not seeing it.  At $40 a month, which is apparently a discounted rate, I would recommend a coach, mentor, or therapist, not this app."
3,Girl2035,"Super fun, time consuming, helps a lot the only thing I dislike is how to see your tests you have to pay money monthly or weekly just to see the score you got that manly the only thing I would change but otherwise it‚Äôs a super fun experience for sure and I think it‚Äôs worth the time to play if you could even play with all the ads every time I get to a next level I always end up getting a ad it‚Äôs every 1min I get one and yeah it‚Äôs fun and a good game but please get rid of the ads and the money their sooo annoyingüôÑ"
4,HULAHUKAGURL,"I did not even know there was a game out here like this.. the game surprised me!! Kind of, it was like poof‚Äôin HEY YOU!! And the game itself picked me and I downloaded or added it?? I am happy about it though.  Atleast, it reminds me to stay on track and work that mind when I have been offline for awhile, just showered, dealing with a lot of stuff at once where I truely do not know how to feel. ATLEAST, THE GAME STAYS ON TRACK WITH ME AND ALWAYS CHECKS IN ON ME AND REMINDS ME THAT I AM IMPORTANT and THAT MY MIND AND THE ACTIVITY AND ACTIVATION GOING ON IN MY MIND IS STILL THERE.   #NOWAYIAMGIVINGUP #ONMYMIND #truemeaningofimportant #TRAININGMYMINDWITHGAMES"
5,panda queen üêº,"I‚Äôve been going through a lot of things in my life and now it kinda feels like when I‚Äôm playing this game it keeps me focused and relaxed. I know this sound so dramatic but I‚Äôm being serious, with every time I‚Äôve been downgraded by others I find peace in listening to music and playing this game. It also really challenges you when you‚Äôre at a harder level. I recommend this game if you just ever want to relax or challenge yourself"
5,V Gilbert,"I‚Äôve only had this app for 2 days and already I‚Äôm enjoying the trainings. I thought it would be fairly boring and repetitive and I would loose interest in it right away, that‚Äôs not what happened though. The challenges are unique enough to keep me engaged making the daily training a pleasure not a chore. If you want to strengthen your brain you should at least give it a chance I think you‚Äôll like it too."
5,J_Master12456,The challenges are a bit easy but that‚Äôs only cause I started yesterday. The app said they would get more challenging as I go on so that‚Äôs cool. The challenges are enjoyable and seeing how I stack up against everyone either makes me feel proud or makes me want to try the challenge again for a better score. I wish there were a bit more challenges in the daily ones. Great app to incorporate into your daily routine.
5,Raylewis777,"I love impulse becauee I Lowkey feel like it helped me get my critical thinking skills back tbh, and for those out there who think it‚Äôs dumb to try and get smarter , or that your stuck where you are then your wrong . Because everybody can get smarter it‚Äôs just if you have supports , and impulse is one of my supports that I feel keeps me up even if I miss a day i still feel motivated to try and beat the next level, to do better on the challenges."
5,Sophie_natural,"Honestly, I think impulse can actually help you build up muscle memory and etc‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm not just going to tell lies about the progress. I just downloaded the game a day ago, but I do see them being fun and Intellectual! I will update on progress as much as I can but so far they are enjoyable games. Some can actually challenge you. For example the candy sorting one I had to see what would happen if I put one candy in the other tube etc‚Ä¶."
5,NBERNENS,"I‚Äôm hooked on this app. I play it multiple times a day. One recommendation would be to add different games or advanced games once each game is mastered. I have mastered so many games that it can get repetitive playing the same ones every day.  But, it is a great app for memorization and brushing up your math skills!  There are puzzles to challenge your brain and also IQ tests which are fun to take. Overall, I do love this app and I‚Äôm hooked, it‚Äôs addicting & I play every morning!"
4,Erkle23,"I‚Äôve had issues in the past that really took a toll on my brain. Memory issues, not being able to say the things in my brain because I can‚Äôt find the right words, etc‚Ä¶ Doing these little exercises has helped me a lot especially with remembering things. I really like how you don‚Äôt have to be a genius to figure out the puzzles like some games. The different levels makes it not so intimidating and keeps you on your toes! Definitely recommend!"
5,JessAriasMommy,"I found this app on TT. I wasn‚Äôt sure about it, especially considering they asked you to  immediately pay for a subscription and only offer a 3 day free trail. They do offer a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù for a lifetime subscription for 30 something dollars. I‚Äôve only played for 2 days but I do really enjoy it. I‚Äôll update my review after spending a few weeks on the app. After some time, I‚Äôll be able to tell wether it‚Äôs actually helping me improve."
5,iamserenanicole,"I have a very active brain- however I don‚Äôt like to over work, over indulge in social media, or tv and movies to keep my brain active. I love my daily games and the other things you can play in you downtime that help train your brain and keep it active!  Writing this after doing my morning meditation where I may then want to pick up my phone and scroll, I picked up my phone for my daily brain games!"
1,fkassar,The only issue I‚Äôve had with this app is it restarted my daily streak back to 0 days even though I completed the daily activity the day prior. It not only set me back to 0 days for no reason but it also gave me the same exact training two days in a row. There is a bug in the app that needs to be addressed so this doesn‚Äôt continually happen. I‚Äôve missed days in the past and was reset to zero accordingly but have never been reset back to a 0 day streak and then given the same training activities two days in a row. Despite completing the 3 activities the day before. Please address this issue and I will update my review accordingly.
5,seleeki,"Whenever I can I try to remember to do them. My notifications are on but sometimes I get swamped with .. you know life. Therefore, I am not able to do them as frequently as I would like but I love it. I‚Äôm working on being more dedicated but it‚Äôs such and amazing app. The game are interactive, they don‚Äôt shove ads down your throat like others and you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything if you don‚Äôt want to. Amazing and keep up the work!!!"
3,bakedchalice,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me or if the app has just gone insane, but why can‚Äôt I customise my training programs any more? In the older version I could do multiple trainings per day that had different focuses, like I remember there was this specific memory training program that ran for a year, or you could do this all-math training, etc. And at the very least I got to choose how many games I wanted in include in my trainings per day, be it 3 or 5 or 7. Now they‚Äôve just all gone and it‚Äôs three games that fit all???"
5,doug_1963,"Being in my 60s, I want to make sure that I do what I can for my brain and reducing the chances of cognitive decline. I‚Äôve tried many different apps for this. Typically they all fill like silly games, but this impulse felt different from the beginning. I thoroughly enjoy the activities. Don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm playing some game design for a 20 something. Started off doing the trial, but within an hour decided to purchase it."
4,KBattgirl2015,"Challenging and fun app to help with memory and executive functioning. Love that there is a huge variety of games and levels.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I just don‚Äôt get paying a weekly charge to play games. I understand this app is not just games, they have a purpose, but I would rather watch ads. Every game I have I just deal with the ads. It gives my eyes a break because I just put my phone down while the ads are playing instead of watching them."
5,TifaniAnn,"I do not typically play or download games, however I have been in need of something to assist in guiding my focus, and sharpen my skills. This app is a perfect quick game that also allows me to direct my focus.   So far I‚Äôve only played for a few days, but I would recommend it. Although the cost is low, it is still unmanageable for my finances so I am not going to be able to continue playing. I do hope to return."
5,usmc6711,"As with life itself, Impulse promotes growth in thinking and observation along with differentiation and prioritization.  When ones ability to assess and retrieve useful information, or the efficient storage of it because the ability to do so has been diminished from cancer and chemotherapy, it trains the mind to regain what was lost . I like it because it helps regain functionality in life and in a fun way. Thanks for such a useful tool!"
4,DeltaDefSquadYo,"Like I said in the title, it's fun and you want to keep playing. The stats are cool as well, they are encouraging, at least to me, to keep attempting to get a better score.  I notice that it really helps me bolster certain cognitive abilities, like memory, pattern recognition, problem-solving, etc.  Way back in 2015, I was in an auto accident, and had a traumatic brain injury. These are the types of games that were recommended by doctors and specialists to strengthen my cognitive development. This one happens to be fun too."
5,Personofsomeintelligence,I meant what I said in the title it gives the most accurate is tests and it‚Äôs mind games and mind workouts are of a high level. The training that it gives definitely shows improvements of all sorts to every aspect of your intelligence. I saw many improvements to my iq including my score going from 114 to 122 in just 1 month. I continue to use this app to strengthen my brain and I would suggest it to any ages from 7-127. Thank you impulse.
5,Flutterbyass420,"A great game to play because it‚Äôs so much fun, while also, keeping your brain on its toes, so to speak, with the puzzle choices and quizzes one can do in the app. It‚Äôs trying but it‚Äôs so interesting and just all around fun. It‚Äôs honestly great for those with age, getting older you forget some things in life once learned so many years ago. We need to be reminded of those things every now and then. It really does help ones brain stay more focused and sharp."
5,Paige Davis üíó,"When I first downloaded the app I took an iq test, and then 6 months later I took it again and my iq had substantially increased. The games are fun, and relaxing, and simple enough that you don‚Äôt rage quit, but not to easy. And it doesn‚Äôt take long, every day you just have to play 3 games minimum  which only takes five minutes. And even without premium it‚Äôs an amazing app. So i would definitely recommend it"
5,khatcherlex,"I love playing these games.  I actually only play like five. Bored over the holidays, I look forward to the challenges laying in bed at night getting better and better.  The only regret, and this is a big one for me, I played a game on my iPhone, won one over a hundred times, but i had to play each a lot to win.  My pinking is now cracked from holding my phone.  Other than that, I sill enjoy them,but on an iPad."
1,Ismar_M,"Paid for the full year last year and loved it. This year I renewed however the last 4 months have been unbelievably buggie. Because I like this app, I send in tickets for fixes, but nothing ever changes.   My favorite game candy sort is now unplayable. When you click start it send you to a blank screen. You have to swipe down to get back to a start screen. From there when you hit the start button  the lag is so bad that it doesn‚Äôt start the game for a full minute. It just gets worse from that point on. I really wish I didn‚Äôt buy another year subscription knowing now how bad the app was going to be."
5,Squadrush78,I wake up and start my day off with training and at first I got tired really quickly but by the third day I wasn‚Äôt as tired.  You work out your brain like a muscle it‚Äôs gonna hurt a little bit or you‚Äôre gonna get tired is what I noticed about doing this app people give up when they‚Äôre like bored or they feel tired but that‚Äôs the whole part of it because you‚Äôre training your brain actually work.!! Great app love it
4,Markimus123,"Great app. Keeps me sharp and my fidgety hands busy. I really enjoyed the IQ/personality tests and paid for the results after an instagram ad kept advertising tests I hadn‚Äôt taken that I was interested in. After paying for the subscription I can‚Äôt access the tests that were advertised and only can access the original 12 I had already taken. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have paid for the subscription if I‚Äôd known that, but still enjoy the games/apps I do have access to."
4,Brooke1119,"While training my brain & working games, it gives me the satisfaction of ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù while settling my brain down. Im always on go, and its hard to turn the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù off in the evenings. Honestly- the recent surge in social media videos really took a tole on my mental health. I couldnt get off. After deleting many apps i havent found a way to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù at night, or distract my thoughts. I really enjoy this app a lot. And plus, it can only help your brain strength in the long run ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,TetrisFan7,"I downloaded this since I was quite curious and took the IQ test. However, I was extremely disappointed when after I spent about 25 minutes doing my test expecting the results when sadly, they force you to pay for the stupid Weekly or Annual subscription to see the full results‚Ä¶. (They literally only show the IQ score and I ain‚Äôt paying $8 for a dang ‚ÄúWeekly‚Äù subscription!) Why didn‚Äôt they say that BEFORE I took the test?! Now, I feel like I just wasted my darn time with this app! Pitiful and disappointing! I can‚Äôt stand it when companies do the stupid false advertising thing‚Ä¶."
1,Hmgbrd9,"This is an application that makes it impossible to unsubscribe. I have sent emails to them asking to unsubscribe my account from renewal and they have not replied for over three weeks. *** And now I received an email from the support team to tell me that there‚Äôs a link I click on to cancel subscription. When I click on the link there is nooooooo place to select CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION. Wrong sir, the subscription is not able to be handled by myself because you don‚Äôt give that option, but there are about 7 different $$ plans to select to stay with the app. Please cancel my subscription like I asked the first time. Thank you"
1,Grease Rocks,"This app advertised that i would get to see my ADHD type, such as inattentive, impulsive, hyperactive etc, and i immediately was asked to pay after i had already accepted the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù to read my results. Then when i paid the 6.99 for a weeks subscription (again, after the app said when i signed up for the free trial there would be no payment during my trial) all the quiz told me was that it would be helpful to see a professional. To be clear, it DID NOT tell me my adhd type or ways i can help my symptoms like the ad suggested. it just said see a professional.   VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL BE SEEKING A REFUND, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU CAME FROM THE ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS *NOT* THE APP ADVERTISED"
5,Exhausted_Emery,"This game is just great overall, i spend hours on it a day cause i just can‚Äôt bring myself to do something else! Though, i‚Äôm a night owl, and the home screen kinda blinds me. So i‚Äôm requesting a dark mode option. Dark mode would make playing at night (which i normally do) so much easier and i‚Äôd probably be playing longer. Other than that, the game is amazing! I‚Äôd totally recommend it to anyone and everyone."
5,cycleofhands,"The little games are fun and even if the brain work and improvement is minor it is still satisfying to feel like I am doing brain workouts.   The general IQ test is really fascinating and I am so curious about the science behind it. I have no doubts abstract / complex pattern recognition does indeed point to general brain efficiency, but what about the questions are suited to measure functionality and if the results line up pretty evenly to scores on other IQ tests.   Definitely try it out"
5,dracula.mcgoo,"This app is, as titled above, made up of many fun and easy to learn puzzle games. These games use eye-catching, brightly colored designs to keep each user not only involved and interested, but more importantly mentally stimulated, constantly thinking and collectively learning. Memory, problem solving and mathematics are just a few of the areas Impulse‚Äôs games help to improve. Highly suggest at least trying, you won‚Äôt fly if you don‚Äôt send üèÑüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§òüèø"
5,r.iley.v3,i found this app on an instagram ad ( shocker huh?) and i really like it. i go to a private school and im way ahead all my peers and since the school is so small we don‚Äôt have advanced classes. This app allows me to challenge myself on my own personal time since my school can‚Äôt do it. i got this last night and im ADDICTED. I turn 16 in late december and i took the IQ test and got 110. I like this app and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about getting it
5,CindyTV,"I highly recommend this app for everyone, no matter what age, to keep your brain sharp and focused. I had this app in my old phone but had to take it off because my phone kept glitching.   When I bought my new phone, I added it again because I noticed my brain & memory not being so sharp. Your brain is a muscle you need to keep active. The games in this app are fun and entertaining."
4,milfinatx,"This game is a lot of fun and stimulating. But I‚Äôve noticed a lot of their elements especially in the spelling challenge, that there‚Äôs a ton of mentions of war, weapons, suicide, depression‚Ä¶even the emojis they chose to use on the game were all weapons and stuff. I just thought that was a bit strange bc the more I played the more I noticed there was SO MUCH stuff on is about weapons, war, and suicide. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the only one who notices this but it definitely caught my attention enough to write a review about it."
1,P/O USER,"Downloaded from an ad on Facebook because the line game looked fun. During the initial setup, it tries to trick you into paying for a subscription at $6.99/month. Get around that and you play three games and bam, ad. Messed up? Ad. Want to try another game? Ad. Woah! Make sure your push notifications are on so we can annoy you! Oh hey, try subscribing. Tried the old trick of turning on airplane mode to get around the ads and then it won‚Äôt even let you play the game. Had it installed for maybe 5 minutes and ended up watching 8 ads. Games are mediocre at best to boot. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this even to a monkey."
5,That‚Äôs what I said,"Until I found impulse , when I would take abreak from my daily tasks I would occupy my brain by playing money winning games but without adding money just playing with my daily free gems ! I would end up getting agitated & frustrated & laying down doing nothing more than contributing to my already full blown procrastination! Impulse is different , it is truely an exercise for your brain !! So glad I found it  !!"
2,NEWCIDERFAN,"I signed up for the free trial but felt I didn‚Äôt have the time to actually use the app. To unsubscribe they ask you to either email the company, or cancel through your account with the website. If you sign up through the AppStore you cant unsubscribe through the website. I managed to cancel it directly through my AppStore subscription management. But for an app to make it so difficult to unsubscribe =shady. That and make sure you read the small print on free trials, to not be charged after the free trial you HAVE to unsubscribe 24 hours prior to free trial ending."
5,Ems Input,I am absolutely loving this brain training technique I believe strongly that their methods of training are exactly what people need to keep their minds sharp because just like it has always been said people that stay active are definitely people who will have less health issues I believe the same for our brain someone who keeps utilizing their brain will have a better chance at keeping it sharp and healthy as well!!!!
1,Mrsuspenders,"I got a Facebook ad that said I could download this app and take a free test to see my ADHD type.    I took the test and then it said to get the results I would have to subscribe to paid plan.    So I guess the test is free, but if you want the results you have to pay for them.    And then they had other marketing strategies in the app where they offered to give me the maximum discount out of 3 discounts in a chance game.  Wow! Lucky Me!     How could I pass up an offer.  Anytime you spin a wheel for a deal on a digital platform, it‚Äôs rigged.    Maybe I can see all of this because on the first three games I played I did over 90% better than all my peers.  And if what they calculated wasn‚Äôt rigged to make myself feel superior, it‚Äôs more likely because my peers are not gullible people that turn to digital snake oil to work out their issues.    That was harsh üò¢.   I didn‚Äôt play it for very long.  But those were my impressions.  If you have spent more time with the app and find it beneficial that sounds coolüëç"
5,Mrs.Allen2.0,I downloaded this app because I‚Äôve been bored and I‚Äôve been looking for something other than solitaire. I just happened to scroll across this app and I decided to give it a try. First off I didn‚Äôt want to pay for it. But I ended up getting 92% off the annual price so I decided to pay for it. And I‚Äôm so glad I did! It‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. It keeps me intrigued and I am so glad I made the decision. I love this app.
5,Blatantly Honest Reviews,"I am going to be clear, I am not a bot. I have been looking for games to keep my mind sharp and this is the best one I have found! Others are very intrusive on making you pay for a subscription but Impulse is not. Impulse gives the user great games which are mentally challenging and can help keep your mind sharp in memory, speed, decision making, and others. Overall amazing app and I definitely recommend it for you."
5,"Great, awsome, nice app","This app has me playing everyday now. Which is very great because it distracts me and it made me more clever. For example, the games they have in the app. It‚Äôs easy and then it gets harder and harder. But since I started with easy first and understood wha I had to do. I become more clever. I would tell my friends to try and they wouldn‚Äôt get it and I would get it and they be like ‚Äúwhaaattt howwwww??‚Äù Lmaoo. Overall it‚Äôs a great app to have."
5,immackulate,"All the little games are really fun, and the statistics they give you afterward are really encouraging! It makes you feel accomplished even though it just takes a few minutes a day. They also have a lot of personality quizzes and little tests to help you understand yourself better. Totally worth the money if you have it, but even if you can‚Äôt pay for a subscription there‚Äôs a lot to gain from using this app."
5,NewlyGreen,"I was hesitant to try this out; I‚Äôve had ADHD literally my whole life, and we tend to find our own work arounds‚Ä¶but I only did these exercises about 5/10 days since installed, and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN MY MEMORY. This is huge for me, as I tend to forget short to mid term things and often lose my train of thought. I‚Äôm going for focus next.  This is the only app that‚Äôs made a marked difference in my memory, and that was with 60% effort. I am so happy I found this."
5,boycefromdallas,"The best workout is in the mind. The exercises  are new versions of new ways to focus on the senses by training. This strategy has made me fundamentally (see I even started saying fundamentally) more adept to understand what processes create the abilities each person is born with yet having to endure a mundane environment becomes a vacuum to those instinctual phenomena that are innately trying to avoid repression. If you don‚Äôt pay attention to it , your mind goes to waste."
5,whitie rabbit,"To help regenerate my Brain when you get older sometimes we think about our weight ,we exercise and try to keep our bodies strong and healthy,but we forget about our Brian ,.Every one probably has heard this ( if you don‚Äôt use it you will lose it). So yes we need to regenerate our Brains.    Impulse is a good training exercise just for that.         This is my first time using this tool and I‚Äôm very happy with it thanks so much."
4,Littlefurballs,"I was getting tired of the same exercises from Elevate so I decided to try this brain training app. It has some good exercises. But what Elevate did was provide explanations/tips on how to solve any exercise I was struggling with. There‚Äôs only so much progress you can make by doing the exercises over and over. If the hints/guidance isn‚Äôt there to help with solving, then it just keeps me stuck.   I do like the assessment quizzes they provide. But they don‚Äôt really tie the exercises proposed with the quizzes all that well."
3,Wazkat,"This is the best Candy Sort game I can find but there‚Äôs a new glitch with every app update. When I go to add a new tube, I get a half-sized tube that only holds 2 balls. Maybe this was intentional but it‚Äôs kind of weird. Also having the restart game button right next to the undo button is very annoying. Also the game freezes up when I complete a game and the balls just sort of freeze in place but I can at least advance to the next level. Hopefully they‚Äôll fix these soon (without adding another issue)!"
5,Slinkie2802,I feel my brain getting stronger everyday I use the app.  The games are quick and I can tell when I find an area I need to work on.  As all 50+ struggles with memory lapses I feel that most of these games have some type of memory spin and they help me build back my memory muscle.  I don‚Äôt love games but these go by fast!  There are a couple like ancient numbers and color sort that I enjoy just for the fun of them.
5,LaurynLoveXO,"I love this app! I‚Äôm not typically a game person when it comes to my phone. On a daily basis, I probably use about 5-6 out of the 28 apps I have on my phone. Idk what made me decide to download this one but I‚Äôm so glad I did! I feel healthier in a sense, every time I complete a new challenge. It‚Äôs addicting! I love that it gives you a description of the benefits you gain from each activity. Definitely glad I found this app!!"
5,Brendakw64,"I enjoy playing Impulse because the games are designed with intellectual purposes, and I like knowing that I‚Äôm training my brain to be sharper, clearer and just all-around better. I like that the games score you against others, so you can see where you stand and what you may need to improve. I also enjoy that there are aptitude tests for IQ, ADHD, and other things available if you‚Äôd like to know your scores."
5,gc56223,This does help you out. If your like me that gets mad so quickly for things but can hold yourself from making a mistake that can destroy you or your life trust me stop and get the app out and try to do this. Once‚Äôs your done you‚Äôll be a bit better I mean calmer then how you were. This is a very good app. I rated this app after a month and some change to give it a honest review. So people don‚Äôt sleep on this app. Thank you good day.
5,Brea564,"I originally downloaded this game only for the brain quizzes they offer, as I was curious about my personality type, ADHD type, and IQ level. I know it‚Äôs not clinically administered, but it was really interesting to get detailed insight on all those things!! There‚Äôs so many more games than I expected, day one I think I played for 3 hours straight and I hardly noticed how much time passed. Oops! I‚Äôm curious to see how my skills improve over time, especially mental math!"
1,Mrceethree,"After asking a bunch of questions of what you would to do with your brain. You are brought to a screen to pay for subscriptions only. When you don‚Äôt want to do this you can do a week only trial. When I saw this I deleted the app right away. After reading the 1* apps before leaving mine, noticed that the developer mentioned in some of those, that there is Ads that can be watch to access some content. They may need to restructure their approach other than wanting people to pay right away. There is plenty of free tools out there for brain help. Don‚Äôt invest in this app unless you think it is completely necessary."
5,Epsilon1942,"I like this app alot and use it daily, though every so often I want to use on an iPad for a bigger screen but I notice that there is no option to sync with iCloud ( or even with the email) as far as I can see, maybe I‚Äôm wrong and I‚Äôm just not seeing this setting somewhere within the app. If this is not currently supported, are there plans to implement this in the future?"
5,mason.bohm,I‚Äôm lowkey addicted to this app. It‚Äôs so interesting and it rlly helps you learn more about yourself and how your brain works. It backs everything up with statistics and others scores. I definitely would recommend the yearly plan. Only 30 bucks if you get the discount and it‚Äôs 100 percent worth it. They have so many activities to do and it really trains your brain to keep u sharp and active. Definitely would recommend this. 10/10
5,KyeKye2231,"This game is great! There is nothing I would change about it. This game has kept my brain sharp and I am learning bc things way quicker than I used to. I love this game, and not only that but it barely has any ads! It has one ad every like 10 minutes. I recommend it, there are many different options to use the app for too, you can use it to manage stress or keep your brain sharp or other options."
5,UofYou,"I used to be so dumb I could even drool correctly, but since downloading this app I‚Äôve been able to dramatically improve my cognition and genius surrounding a multitude of different disciplines. I‚Äôve recently applied to MIT, Harvard and Yale and was awarded full ride scholarships to each all thanks to impulse!  Momma said‚Ä¶ my momma said that If you don‚Äôt download this app right now and sign up for the premium you may have something wrong with your medula oblongotta!"
4,hammy lover721543,It‚Äôs really ü§© fun. And I love ‚ù§Ô∏è everything about it. I have really nothing to complain about. It‚Äôs really fun ü§© and it helps you with getting smarter. I‚Äôm in third grade and my teacher is so nice üòä. But sometimes a little bit harsh. Still she is a good teacher and I‚Äôll miss her when I go to fourth grade nest year. Still back to the game. The game is really fun ü§© and I give it four stars ‚≠êÔ∏è. Not that it‚Äôs bad or anything. It‚Äôs a fun game really fun ü§© it is. And I just want to say ‚Äú Thank you üòä Inpulse for the game.‚Äù And sorry üò£ if I misspelled your game name.
5,RipTornRick,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now, and it‚Äôs been a game-changer for improving my mental focus. The variety of games provided are not only enjoyable but also challenging, keeping me engaged and motivated. Additionally, the numerous tests available are incredibly helpful in tracking my progress and identifying areas for improvement. Highly recommend this app to anyone looking to sharpen their mind while having fun!"
5,311All,"I have always had a problem with comprehension.  I wish my mom would have had me tested when I was a kid.  45 years ago.  As I have gotten older 54 even now I have a hard time remembering things.  However, doing this app helps me slow down a bit and relax and being told I am an ugly STUPID M-Fer pretty regularly, passing these little test I. Record time seems to help my confidence.  They are fun.  And it brings me back to a happier time for me."
5,Ski scan,I‚Äôm writing this review a little early. Everything seems good so far. A little on the east side but I figure things will get harder. I don‚Äôt like that simple mistakes cannot be fixed. Example. A problem was set up in a way that made it look like division instead of subtraction. The example we worked out before we started wasn‚Äôt set up that way. Maybe that was part of it tho. I‚Äôm not sure. But so far so good.
3,Elisemarie66,"I‚Äôve been seeing ads which make it seem as though this app will personalize your brain training, based on the results you receive in various personality, archetype and IQ tests. I tried the free trial and I was disappointed to find out that the brain training exercises are just generic memory and card-matching games. I tried to take the ‚Äúyour archetype‚Äù test and, only after answering the all of the questions, the app requires users to upgrade to an paid-up-front annual plan before it will reveal your results."
5,BOMB APP and fun too!,"With dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs, running on my maternal and paternal side of the family, I‚Äôve been looking for something to stimulate my brain and keep it busy during brief periods of down time when I don‚Äôt have enough time to get into reading an article or education material. This app is great because I can play quick games that stimulate my thought process, and I also get to test and learn more about my own personality."
5,Lolo_beanz,I downloaded this app a couple days ago and immediately loved it! The games are fun and challenging and doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äòtraining my brain‚Äô.  My only issue for me is it seems there is no way to sync progress across multiple devices (?). I took some of the tests on my iPad and played some games on my iPhone but neither shows the other devices progress.  Would love that ability!
5,what will i do,"I really enjoy Impluse. This is my third day doing the tasks/games. I really like how you can set your own setting, and get games specialized for you! I also enjoy that you only have about 3-5 games tasks to do a day! You can set your notifications to let Impluse remind you of when to do your tasked games. So far, I haven‚Äôt ran into any trouble. If you need a game that helps with anxiety, s/a, or any other triggers, than Impluse is just for you! <33."
5,Canivel,"We can all say that we want to get better at remembering things and keeping our brain sharp. It‚Äôs common that if you continue to practice a little by little you will get better at certain things that you‚Äôre trying, with this app it seems that I will be able to sharpen my skills and have fun at the same time so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing my continual growth while using this app."
1,Consumer99goo,"Good games. Easy to use app. BUT, it says on the description here that you can invite friends and train together. Thats a straight blatant lie. You cannot invite friends. There is no friends section or setting. You CANNOT train with friends either! There is zero functionality for inviting friends and training together. I even emailed them and they confirmed. Not possible but we love the idea! Huh??? There is a link inside the app to ""invite a friend"". Once again, a lie. Its simply a link to share the app so someone else can go to the app store and go try it on their own. Deceptive description to get clicks. Id love to have my subscription money back. Im contacting Apple."
5,Face22222536,"I held off purchasing until they offered a much lower annual rate and I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôve enjoyed way more than I expected!  I got on a 22 day streak and it felt good to accomplish something that could help my memory and brain function. I have a family history of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs so I know even small daily brain quizzes can be beneficial. They‚Äôre fun, easy, and I‚Äôd rather dump time into puzzles than mindless scrolling on social media!"
4,Lententac,"I use this app every day and absolutely love it. Im a teen on the spectrum and have adhd so i decided to download this app to see if it would help me personally. I really doubted it but i ended up loving it. I just wish it was more accessible to people without extra money too spend. You can get some parts for free but to get most of the stuff you have to pay a subscription that is quite pricey to people who dont have much. Overall amazing, just want prices down."
5,Nope no ‚Äúname‚Äù or ‚Äúnickname‚Äù,"This is an amazing app to train your brain. I highly suggest getting it. Even though there are a few adds, it‚Äôs worth it. You can do these tests, and brain-games, and even test your personality. I have only one complaint. It always keeps bugging me to get the ‚ÄúPremium Edition‚Äù thingy, and it‚Äôs gotten kinda annoying. But Impulse is such a great brain app, so good! It‚Äôs addicting, I will admit it. But still, you MUST consider getting it. Thanks for reading!"
5,Rose Morrison,"Love this brain game, but I would love it even more if they can make it free. Why should we have to pay for wanting to be educated? Education should be free. Having free education will help so many people and it will give so many people better opportunities to do better for themselves and it will give people jobs and that will keep people off of the streets so they are not homeless and on drugs if we had free education. Think about it."
2,Fiery1,"I was hoping for more out of this app to be honest. I emailed the company to share feedback directly. Almost every day I am given the same games, whether I score horribly or very well. This ends up making me not want to play it, though I‚Äôve been putting in my session time regardless. Also, I would expect some ‚Äútips‚Äù after time, suggestions on how to improve scores in upcoming sessions, or a different game to be offered that works on the same skills through a different approach. I think there is plenty of room for improvement here. This is a purchase I regret."
1,andrea.cardonazz,"The app itself is repetitive and after a day of playing these games you will get bored. The games are not challenging at all, and are always the same ones the levels barely get harder‚Äî I don‚Äôt think this actually trains your brain at all. Not to mention I did the free trial, but obviously it makes you put in your credit card. I tried to cancel the trial, sent numerous emails, and it is impossible to do so. I am having trouble getting refunded for it and overall think this app is a scam save yourself the trouble. If you really want to train your brain go read a book, or complete a puzzle‚Äî believe me there are much better ways."
1,lacee2008,"Once I found that basically everything was hidden behind a paywall, I deleted the app AND unsubscribed. However, two days later I was still charged. Nowhere in any setting do I have the option to unsubscribe a second time. I even downloaded the app again, stumbled through all of the fake discount pop ups, and IN the app it says I‚Äôm subscribed but does not have an option to unsubscribe either- so I guess I‚Äôm just stuck paying a $6.99 fee for an app I don‚Äôt want to use when I‚Äôm thousands of dollars in medical debt. That makes sense. I‚Äôm so tired of apps pretending to be helpful when they only want your money. Sticking with Happify and UCLA mindful."
3,Roseann152,"Impulse was just automatically renewed.  I have been trying to cancel the subscription, but I have been unable to do so. When I went into the original app site, it mentions app support but when I sent my message it just remains stagnant so I‚Äôm not even sure if they‚Äôre getting the message. I know that this is a very good app because friends of mine have used it. Unfortunately, I have been unable to do so for personal reasons. Response from the company would be really helpful in this situation."
5,cailliecat1,This really is a very fun way to train your brain. There are some games in it that are a little hard but that‚Äôs the point the more I try the better I get!!  I really love this app and was surprised at how user friendly it was. I get frustrated with apps and Lowkey bored so I‚Äôll app surf but this one keeps me playing on it forever and  is really smooth with tons of options for games to play. Definitely recommend 12/10
5,emliy4537,so so so the app is amazing it‚Äôs learnable it‚Äôs teachable and most of all it‚Äôs fun! The first time I played I was like we‚Äôre do u go to play the games on here and then I saw my routine and that‚Äôs we‚Äôre I saw my games I just pushed one of the routines and it took me there the game I ABSOLUTELY LOVE is draw one line that‚Äôs what I got this game for I saw it on my adds on other games I just love it I mean I like the other games to but this one was my favorite and pls don‚Äôt make any changes ü•π bye üòéüòéüòéüòéüßã
5,Ryan Leehan,I bought a subscription for both me and my best friend and we both love it. I was never into brain game apps but this one has surpassed my expectations. She loves these kind of apps and has been constantly playing the games and doing the workouts. The workouts are her absolute favorite part of the app. Definitely worth the money. We both got 92% discounts and I absolutely am proud of what I am getting for my money.
5,Abreebee,"Did a quiz, paid for full version/results (it‚Äôs 6.99 per week but you can cancel and do one purchase if that‚Äôs your thing), did the rest of the quizzes, then played all 235 levels of Draw One Line in three days. They have lots of games though, and I think I‚Äôll move on to the one that‚Äôs like Wordle. Overall worth downloading free, and worth at least $7 if you want the quiz results. There‚Äôs IQ, fear response, emotional intelligence, and more."
5,Irenenumber2sinceirenewastaken,"I was hesitant to pay the monthly fee because I didn‚Äôt want another unnecessary subscription Im probably not going to use BUT I have ADHD and struggle a lot in areas of focus, memory and impulsivity. I just started it and it‚Äôs already entertaining my brain. I like how they increase difficulty and compare your score to other people so you can see your growth within time. You pick if you want 5 / 10 or 20 minutes per day. I picked 10."
5,ErikaYuki,They have several interesting test games and things that gives nostalgia but mostly memory from pre k they have harder courses and also ask questions about mental state and trauma its really amazing you should definitely at least download and try it out im a mom of 5 with a husband and business it really helps unwind everyday life it give you something to think about
5,HBG1994,"This is the best way to train your brain, my memory and overall cognitive ability has drastically improved. I received a discounted subscription through an advertisement online and have since switched phones and cannot get back on my original account. I still use it everyday but I am disappointed I lost my progress. By all accounts this app does work, thank you."
4,Jsjdjdnc nd,"Filled with very simple games and helpful quizzes and tests. The sad thing about the tests and quizzes is that you can only see the results if you have the premium version. I feel If you made the free trial accessible without needing to pay this could make people more interested in getting the premium version. You could also show a less detailed report of the quiz or test you took. Other than that the app seems fine, will keep using it."
4,Mamdhfrje,"I love the game impulse! I found it while searching through the App Store and it got a ton of good reviews so I got it! It is a good challenging game that is both fun and makes you think. There are a ton of ads which makes it a little bit annoying, but it is pretty worth it. It shows how you compare to others on different types of games which I think is helpful. It shows you the areas that you could improve on! Overall, it‚Äôs great!"
5,Ale_TheOne,"at first, I was a little skeptical, but as I started to play with the three day trial, I really liked it and so far I am only on my third day but I can tell it does help a lot and it constantly gives my brain something to think about which is good! Honestly, five stars indeed!! Plus, it gives you a lot of different games so you really truly only need this app and you will have a lot of games in it."
5,cocobutta522,It‚Äôs really important to me that I am using parts of my brain I don‚Äôt always get a chance to work on. I had a stroke in the past so I‚Äôve had to learn from the beginning again‚Ä¶ I am doing some games and more in this app that I was doing in the hospital to help train my brain again. It‚Äôs nice to be able to continue improving my health after I‚Äôve been out of the hospital. Would definitely recommend this game
5,QueenIshh Cloud9,"It‚Äôs great !! You actually want to play and really enjoy playing and then finding out your personal results and they even let you know how you compare with people your age as well !! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone at least give it a try!! Why not !?? It won‚Äôt hurt you or take from you at all!! You can only gain from this awesome app! So don‚Äôt wait, stop procrastinating and JUST DO IT üòâ"
5,Piccilo the Reaper,"Impulse is incredible. I have finally found an app that activated my brain in a healthy way and helps strengthen my memory, reflexes and thinking. Definitely one of the best time passer apps I have ever downloaded.   Impulse also offers things like IQ tests, personality quizzes and so much more.   I love how the mini games also increase in difficulty each time you complete a daily challenge. Definitely keeps it interesting."
4,I am a Lauren Z side fan,"I really like this game because really fun and it‚Äôs also like learning but in like a really fun way and it‚Äôs for your brain and it really helps though even though I don‚Äôt feel any different and it‚Äôs actually kind of relaxing and I love doing all these like games and stuff so maybe in a while that I can maybe feel smarter a better memory, and can sort stuff better and do math better it‚Äôs actually really fun and I think that you should get this game or app"
5,MikeyRatea,"This game that I'm playing is satisfying, making me smart, and most importantly, it's a fun game. I definitely recommend trying this game. Im glad that easy games can actually make you smart. Who would've thought. This is definitely worth to be put in the 5 star box. I'm glad they make some games that are good for me. That's some material to tell you that this games perfect for people who want to be smart."
5,Sassy8717,I‚Äôm a 42yr old mom and I actually enjoyed this game. It makes you think and no game is alike. It gets harder as you go and requires you to zone out the background and pay attention.  Won‚Äôt be paying the ridiculously expensive price for the ‚Äúfull app‚Äù but what you get for free is 100% worth it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúcalming‚Äù app by any means but perfect for sitting in car loop or just during the day if you have 20min free time.
5,shell81bell,I suffer from a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and I just found this game. It really is helpful. I just started playing and I‚Äôm excited to keep playing as the puzzles get more difficult. I need these exercises because I have some short-term memory loss and need reminders because things just vanish in my mind. I think this game is a great way to strengthen my brain and process things easier and  faster and maybe help remember daily tasks and such.
5,dudeitsmemiley455,"I never normally leave reviews, but I was very impressed by this app! In July I was in a severe car accident and had a traumatic brain injury along with other things. I‚Äôve been dealing with memory issues since then, and became afraid and anxious for quite a while. I got this app just to see if it would do anything and I can honestly say that after using this app for a while it has helped me tremendously. So thank you!!"

1,Mr$...T!!n|< babii,"I kept seeing this game and finally decided to download it cause I‚Äôm a puzzle person and was really interested! After getting this particular question ‚ÄúA man who has people working for him especially servants or slaves‚Ä¶.‚Äù And the answer to unscramble be MASTER!! I deleted it and will never recommend this game! I will be posting on all my social media plate forms in hopes to have the maker remove the question, the games getting shut down, and have them apologize to everyone! I hope all races who believe in things like this shouldn‚Äôt be on here erase this game cause this is horrible. What if there is a smart child playing this game and they have come across it!!"
1,Evelyn Ros√©,"This game was starting to earn my honest respect‚Ä¶..until I finished a 72 question test just to see that I had to pay for the rest of the results. The least they could do is give us somewhat of an idea about what the results means but they couldn‚Äôt even do that. They just throw a word in our face and expect us to take it and be fine with it, the least they could do is give a small paragraph of what it means (again, they can‚Äôt even do that either). Trash app. The same as everyone else‚Ä¶..MONEY HUNGRY. Deleted. I‚Äôll be finding something better that‚Äôs actually FREE. Smh. If I could rate this trash app, I‚Äôd give it negative zero. Pathetic."
5,AxolotlGoddess,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm using the free trial right now so I don‚Äôt yet know how I‚Äôll feel on the free model.  I really like this app. It‚Äôs colorful, engaging, and thoughtful. I like the variety of puzzles and challenges each day, and I like knowing where my brain stands in comparison to an average. It also lets you focus on different things you want to improve, such as memory, reflexes, and stress relief. If you have the space, I‚Äôd say give this app a chance."
5,JeannieGurl,"I‚Äôve utilized this app now for more than a year and continue to enjoy the daily trainings; games; and functions. It aids with keeping your mind focused as well as challenging the brain to think, especially in games with hand eye quick coordination. As a TBI survivor this has been very beneficial to me. My personal suggestion to the developers would be to include additional training each day. Thank you for this awesome app üòäüòäüòä"
5,Lindsay2000,"Seriously all the little pop ups that tell me Im out performing 75% 78% 89% even 99% of my peers haha. Love the games, they aren‚Äôt hard but they do make you think. For the texts/mental exams it would be cool to see some new options become available like the Meyers-briggs test but the current ones are great if you feel like you need help with self reflection/introspection. Overall big fan of this app."
5,Ezzy Dabows,"look meditation or picking up a new hobby can take up a lot of time, energy and planning to get your brain building and maintaining  new connections but this app will help you do that for a few minutes a day! With an affordable lifetime option, i‚Äôve been using impulse (on and off) for about 2 years and i can see the growth i‚Äôve made not only in the app but especially in my executive functioning skills!"
5,jessicalynn_*,"Impressed to be honest, can‚Äôt afford to purchase the app, but memory, iq tests really help people like myself, so far, I am impressed. Like to see what I can do at minimal with the results that they provide on the free version. So many good apps, just that they all cost a pretty penny, which is the only bad things about these types of apps. Indeed they can help people of all backgrounds and abilities. Just wished that it was accessible for everyone"
5,Mere67193,"I love the app so far. Great fun games that are just the right amount of challenge to be fun but feel like you‚Äôre working your brain for them. Cool tests too, to lead about yourself! I bought the subscription and have played every day. It‚Äôs also not so addicting like other phone games that you don‚Äôt want to put it down. I can easily take a 5 or 10 minute break to play and go back to my work."
5,Maui_The_Demigod_100,"Seriously a game such as this is so simple and that‚Äôs why I love this, it guides and trains you considerably good. It won‚Äôt mentally strengthen you right from the start, yet the more you play and practice the higher your mental health, strength, and capacity grows without you realizing it. And that alone lets you know how much you‚Äôve played into this game. Don‚Äôt believe me? Watch you‚Äôll encounter the same experience.   Job well done game devs. (“Ç‚ó°ÃÄ_‚ó°ÃÅ)·ï§"
1,cucumber899,"Would not give a single star- Unable to opt out . Did not give me the option to cancel after download . Immediately after download was shown a screen stating free trial and xx fees after one week or so. It was shown for only a few seconds and before I could figure out how to cancel it ( as I did not want to pay) it took me to the terms and conditions page .In the terms and conditions it says I need to cancel within 24 hrs of the end of the free trial from apple subscriptions  , but when I go to the apple subscriptions- this shows up as free trial and is not letting me cancel it. Even within the app , I can‚Äôt figure out how to cancel ."
5,Shannakm,"This is a wonderful tool for anyone to measure their mental progress and understand more about themselves in the process.  I have had several brain traumas as well as severe PTSD, the puzzles are great to keep things moving.  The tests are engaging and informative.  They seem more in line with the actual tests given by Psychiatrists for evaluations.  Nothing wonky or mainstream about this app.  One of the best things I have ever downloaded for myself."
5,Wendyn3boys,I practice this daily. I notice the difference from when I‚Äôm stressed and or sleepy vs bright but I also try hard to do my daily challenges. I‚Äôd like it more if I could say how I ‚Äúfeel‚Äù my brain was working. I even did it the day my besties passed away. I did horrible but I wanted to continue the challenges to get the most out of it. It‚Äôs a couple minutes a day just for you!
5,kmacfresh,"I like that besides the mental training, there are psychological tests to see what personality type you are, for example. The app helps you to learn your attributes, hone in on what may need improvement on, and generally just get a better idea of what characteristics you have. The tests aren‚Äôt super long, so you can easily set & meet a minimal goal and strive for more if you‚Äôre up for the task! I think you too will enjoy Impulse."
5,Muh Ris Uhhh,"I don‚Äôt really enjoy phone games honestly. But this app has several different games, each with its own purpose. The games help train your attention, focus, critical thinking, memory, etc. They range in difficulty and each game has levels to increase your skill level. It‚Äôs a super fun app and it‚Äôs free! Also, this app is a wonderful break from social media when I don‚Äôt know what else to do."
5,No sirreee bob,"The games are quick, so it‚Äôs not inconvenient to give my brain a little extra exercise when I have downtime. The directions are easy to understand to complete the challenges, and I also like that it shows your results in comparison to other users. Works other parts of your brain that you may not use normally on a daily basis. A worthwhile purchase to stay sharp!"
5,Jesus‚Äôs little girlüòÅ,"I like games that will help you keep your brain sharp, and this bye far is one of the best, I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs easy to follow and clear to understand with a wide variety of activities, that‚Äôs not all either, my favorite part  of this app would probably be the personality quiz and the left vs right brain quiz to test which side of the brain you use the most. All in all this app is a lot of fun, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.üòÅ"
5,SakuraStardust12,"I‚Äôve been drilling with a lot of anxiety and stress lately. I also feel like I have a hard time focusing. The games in this app have really been helping me a lot! I feel calmer, sharper, and more focused when I dedicate at least 10 minutes to playing the games each morning. If you want to find a way to reduce anxiety and improve focus, in a way that‚Äôs not via meditation, then I really recommend this app!"
1,Scoped00,"I gave this app a try and signed up for an annual because it said I could cancel anytime.  After a couple of days I decided to cancel. I figured they‚Äôd pro-rate me and only charge for a couple of days, or worst case scenario charge for a month.  Nope. They are making me stick with it for the full year. My cancellation won‚Äôt go into affect until it‚Äôs time for the 1 yr renewal.  I did not see any small print that would have made that clear. Bad faith, guys.  The games are ok, not great.  Some things don‚Äôt make sense such as how they keep track of your scores vs those of your peers.  Also the progress chart is not intuitive."
3,Brace_Bear,"My biggest gripe is that the program puts a badge on the icon, and when you open the program to see what the badge represented, there are ZERO, NADA, NO indications why the program put a badge on the icon. If your going to put a badge on the icon, at least have a clear reason why displayed when the user opens the program. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the mouse being offered the piece of cheese and then it‚Äôs yanked away, or the horse being teased by a carrot on a string. I must click the icon to find the prize within the app that doesn‚Äôt exist."
5,Jorro11,"Many of us have played various games on our phones for fun. This app makes an excellent choice of games that are fun in many ways while also engaging in ways that I‚Äôve found myself lacking compared to when I‚Äôve previously done them as a kid.   Excellent concept of an app, and one that I believe is beneficial versus many of the other time wasters that occupy our screen time."
5,Jesusisking1226,It‚Äôs a great app. I just have 2 complaints. I get anxiety from seeing the ‚Äú people have done these levels in this amount of time‚Äù like it goes against my own pace. Second thing I think is annoying is how weird the touch screen reaction is. Like on word searches I clearly swipe down and it goes sideways. Like dude this app is the only app I‚Äôve seen to do this. It‚Äôs super strange. But other than that it‚Äôs great.
2,Ridiculous Amount of AdsüòÉ,"Game is great even for the LITE or free version. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I enjoy it. However, free version has a ridiculous amount of ads. Literally after every single button you click weather choosing a game or pressing the next button for next game, there. Is. An. Ad. Literally after every button. Even when you decide to change the game/challenge whatever you want to call it.   Like I said game is great but the amount of ads is totally unnecessary. It‚Äôs like one of those free and simple games made in China where there‚Äôs an ad after everything you press."
5,bronzebennett,This app is excellent. It has so many types of games to play and I love how they build upon one another to create a personalized experience for the user. I especially love the game where you have to sort between paper and plastic even though that‚Äôs the one I scored lowest on. It trained my brain to see things differently. There is another game as well where you train in order of operations that was great as well.
1,toonin' it,"To be honest overall this app feels AI generated to me. There are grammatical errors throughout each module and test which to me removes the legitimacy of this app and the tests they are providing. While there are some decent insights, the feedback seems very generalized and surface level, almost like a horoscope. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend paying for this app. It is very pushy and salesy up front to get you to subscribe which I also don‚Äôt enjoy. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the ‚Äú600,000‚Äù+ 5 star reviews are AI generated after looking through many of them. Either that or these peoples brain function is not improving which defeats the purpose of the app."
1,Jazik,"Very disappointed. I enjoyed the games at first but then the joy faded out.   Unfortunatly I had a bad customer service experience.   I was notified via email that my subscription was about to renew and informed of various ways to cancel. So I reached out through email because I wasn't able to cancel any other way. No one had gotten back to me in two days, my subscription renewed, I was charged, I emailed again, and finally got a response that they require 24 hours notice to cancel (which I gave), and then told they don't do refunds. Now I am stuck with an app I don't use and owe money I don't have."
5,ddfkkkjj,"I love this app so far ! I hate I have to pay for it to get the full benefits but anything worth having is worth paying for. Social media apps are free because they provide no benefit this app charges because it makes you better. Deleted social media apps to try to focus more and thought it would be hard. Downloading this app made it super easy, haven‚Äôt even thought about scrolling ."
2,KM19472,"Watch ads longer than you play a game for. I don‚Äôt mind having ads, but this is excessive.  Edit after developer response: after 10-15 seconds of an ad, you can press >>. Then press done, then press X. That‚Äôs 3 clicks to remove an ad. The ad is often after every single level of a game, some being only 10 seconds long. No thanks, I‚Äôve already deleted the app and moved on to something less frustrating. I suggest you play your own app (with ads) and see how long you last. PS, $50 is far more than the ‚Äúprice of a few cups of coffee‚Äù."
5,Htide16,"I‚Äôve been playing the games for about a month. It gives you the games for the day to play, but you do have of the option of playing different games to choose from throughout the day. Some games are easy to play and some get harder as your progress in the game. The games have been very entertaining. I love that you have plenty of games to choose from. So far so good."
5,My brain perfect now,This is the best way to help learn to have impulse control focus and learn that is an app. I would highly recommend this game. And when u get to open the gifts it‚Äôs no a scam it will not make you pick a very low percentage off. When I opens the box I got 92% off that‚Äôs how I know it‚Äôs not a scam. If you download this app because you want to do brain workouts not just play games I‚Äôm sure you would like it. Have a good dayüòä
5,TinaRen19,"(real review- not sponsored!!) i just starting adding this to my daily routine because i want to keep my brain healthy. i‚Äôm a world where most of us are sitting in front of tv or social media most of the day, it‚Äôs so healthy to remember your brain and keep it sharp!! i love that they keep track of your daily streak and gives you a variety of different games each day. 10/10 for sure"
1,Libbi10315,"I‚Äôve been trying to cancel my subscription for a whole week now and they won‚Äôt let me and now they just took $7.51 out of my account when I literally was just about to spend on something else. I don‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt let me cancel my subscription. Please get this figured out because I‚Äôm done and I can‚Äôt delete the app because they won‚Äôt let me because I said if I delete the app it doesn‚Äôt cancel subscription but then I‚Äôm like I do my subscription is said it was already cancelled, but then why the heck are you guys charging me seven dollars still? Like get it together."
1,Cxangel123,"s c a m, immediately they try and force you to pay for their stupid extra stuff. I ‚Äúwon‚Äù 94% off and it was advertised as 56 CENTS a WEEK so I figured oh okay and my only option being hit yes or lose the deal. They took the full 30$ out of my account and I‚Äôm extremely upset because that is absolutely NOT what I agreed to. Immediately deleted the app because I don‚Äôt even want it anymore. I also informed many friends family and colleagues to not even bother and they all agree! Put yourself in my shoes, I just wanted a little mental comfort and help and figured I‚Äôd give it a shot but now I am out 30$ on an app???? Absolutely not. Disgusting."
5,kidjvurnhjr,Love this app and get to play all the brainy games I love the most. I‚Äôve deleted all my other apps like this. It gives you workouts and you can play whichever ones you want aside from that. Even the areas of my biggest struggles where the other apps would make me so frustrated this one keep me below that frustration while still challenging me. And the other areas are just fun!
5,ICUNurse99,I love this game. It helps to keep your memory sharp and the games aren't that hard. They do increase in difficulty which I like. It lets you get used to the format of the games. I have enjoyed playing the games thus far. It has helped with my memory retention. I had a stroke and I have some cognitive issues so this seems to help. I also had some prior memory issues and it is helping with those also.
5,unable to track grade,I noticed an ad for this app on a social media platform. I usually swipe ads away but this caught my eye and decided to try it. I just started using it for 2 days at 5 minutes a day. It is interesting and fun. So far it doesn‚Äôt take too much of my time and doesn‚Äôt constantly send me notifications. It is straight to the point and instructions are clear and easy to follow.
3,Suggestions & whatnot,I just downloaded this app about a week ago. I‚Äôm can‚Äôt afford the full membership right now since it‚Äôs Christmas time. But I like it so far. I especially like the tests it offers on personalities and ADHD although I haven‚Äôt taken the ADHD one yet. I enjoy its wide variety. It‚Äôs extremely easy to use and some of the memory games remind me of a card game my Mom used to play with my brother and I as kids. I‚Äôll give a better review once I‚Äôve tried it for a longer period of time. I think it‚Äôs worth a go though!
2,S1mps4n1c,I saw this app on TikTok about its archetypes in which I downloaded the app. It did not say anything about needing to pay to see results for any test or that you need to pay to do basic test in the app. I personally feel like should be stated in the ads. I will be deleting the app because if this. It's quite annoying tbh. I also saw on a different review that the developers had said you can watch ads to unlock things the issues I have with that is there isnt anywhere in the app that says you can watch ads nor is there any option to watch ads.
2,01010011 01100001 01101101,"I got an ad for this on my Facebook, showing an example of a trauma test, revealing ‚Äúwhat type of trauma‚Äù you have. I was interested, because I have trauma, so I downloaded it. After going through all the set up and denying buying a subscription multiple times, I took the test for the trauma response. When I got to the end, the report came up and behind it was yet another ad for the subscription. And I can‚Äôt see the report unless I buy the subscription. So, this was a waste."
5,bsddddddd,"I have been using this app for a few days now and I already love it!  The app gives you daily challenges and also if you finish those they have free games!  The one and only thing about the app is that when you take any test on the app (IQ Test, Personality Quiz, etc.), it does show you your results but it only shows you a part of it, other then than I love it!"
5,Blackwell222,"I have a neurological condition called Wernicke‚Äôs Encephalopathy. It affects the way I remember information and a lot of my memory is based on strong emotions. So if something makes me very nervous, excited, mad, happy, sad then I typically remember it. But everyday things like medications, appointments, showers, and etc. just slip. This app has given me a tool to practice and work on my memory in small ways! I love it and enjoy it very much."
3,Ashley L B,"I‚Äôm torn between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I really do love the games, but the awful saving is almost gamebreaking.   I‚Äôve done over 650 levels of the candy sorting, but a lot of them say I haven‚Äôt beat the level (which of course I did, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to move forward). I completed a level a couple days ago that was a harder one than usual and took a few days of me coming back to it until I eventually got it. I then did a few levels after that one, no problem.   Except now I‚Äôve lost that progress, and I‚Äôm back to this awful level.  I‚Äôm a completionist. I want all the levels to have a pretty green checkmark, but if I go back to a level that didn‚Äôt save to give it the checkmark, then the level after that one no longer has a checkmark.   Make it make sense."
4,ZeikdaGad,"this app is cool because they give certain tests that i would like to know about myself in quick format. How accurate they are is another thing, but it does use user-base data against your scores so it measures your intellect against other users personal percentile, and thats something. Havent gone through personality tests and stuff, but i dont see any self help lessons or games that help anxiety/stress related things just more of memory, math and reactions. Still fun!"
4,AubieWaddle,"First off, I love this game. It is great. My issue is that it is glitching a ton though. On Candy Sort especially, I will complete a few levels and then hop off. When I come back on, only every OTHER level is completed and I have to redo a bunch of other levels! If not for this, the game would have 5 stars. Also, on robotic flows, there are some levels that are wayyyy too easy as there are too many extra spaces that you can exploit. Someone fix this please!"
5,IamreviewingSJ,Worthwhile time spent. I like that you can get in a quick brain exercise any time of day. Even 5 minutes. Or just a couple! Been missing my mind exercises and this is definitely helping to get back into flexing the MOST important ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù üí™  I would prefer not to be asked to pay for subscription all the time‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs how these things go. Try it out!
5,MadinWonderland,"I‚Äôve had long COVID for over a year and being in my late 40‚Äôs my memory wasn‚Äôt what it used to be before transacting COVID multiple times even though I had been vaccinated. This app helps me to sharpen my focusing, detail, and attention skills to improve the loss I‚Äôve encountered. Try it‚Ä¶you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs fun, helpful, and only takes a few minutes a day even though you‚Äôll always want more."
2,ice queen l,I downloaded this app because I saw quite a few ads about it on Tiktok. I used the free trial to do a test run and here‚Äôs what i‚Äôve decided. The app is absolutely not worth the David Hasselhoff that comes with it. The games are copies of free games you can easily download in the app store. The quizzes are useless because you can‚Äôt view the full report without a yearly subscription. This app seems to prey on people‚Äôs insecurities relative to mental capacity and it‚Äôs disturbing. Save your time & don‚Äôt bother. This app is a lackluster compilation of elements you can locate on the internet for free with a simple search.
5,treelo525,I love this app that‚Äôs why I purchased a year of premium pro gave me a discount but it only gave me basic premium I am disappointed because I downloaded and subscribed to unlock childhood trauma for healing myself to becoming a better person for myself but I can‚Äôt afford the price it now says premium pro costs I wish you guys would be more clear on each level of subscription
3,chasetrot,"There were three puzzles I enjoyed doing that significantly relaxed me. Unfortunately, there are only so many challenges of every game before you‚Äôre cut off. Meaning, if they have 800 puzzles of your favorite game and you accomplish all 800, you cannot reset to continue playing (they say that they will create more challenges, until then ‚Äúgame over‚Äù). Annoying that you can‚Äôt restart that game from the beginning. If it weren‚Äôt for this hiccup, I would have given 5 stars."
5,gremlin.panda,"There‚Äôs a theory where if you spend a second mindfully getting all ur thoughts and energy out, you will be able to be more focused on any tasked you know you need to do. That‚Äôs what the app does for me. It‚Äôs kind of like micro learning. I read some reviews and some people have said it gets boring, but I think that‚Äôs also a good thing? It could be a good thing so you can get off ur phone and do ur work LOL"
4,MrsBromo11,So me and my friend were having a sleepover and let‚Äôs call my her Jenna so we were playing games on our phones together and we got bored of the ones we had so my friend downloaded it and I asked what game is that I said oh it‚Äôs called impulse she said and I went and downloaded it and omg I loved it but! I have a suggestion maybe you could like add friends and play Brain games with them like Co op anyway if you are looking to download it please download it‚Äôs such a good game :)
5,SB11086,"I really do enjoy playing this, it has daily challenges and many different ways to expand on your mind. Also it has really fun quizzes to test yourself. Sometimes you think you know but you don‚Äôt make sure to read the directions of the game thoroughly before playing it. It has been easier to use this app then have a bunch of the individual apps."
4,Malhu-cucurucu,"I‚Äôve had this app for over 2 months now, and playing these every day I‚Äôve mastered them pretty quickly. You guys should update the app constantly and change the games UPDATE the games, change them, add new games, change them, make them better, interesting, different, challenging. They are pretty much the same, even the math equations are the same! how are we supposed to improve or stay sharp with the same exercises over and over!"
1,bunchygerm,"At first looking at the ads for this actually seemed pretty good. I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting my brain to the test. Then you download the app. All they try to do is sign up for a subscription that isn‚Äôt cheap, they offer up a free trial hoping you forget about the subscription you signed up for once the trial expires. Even with the free trial it‚Äôs ad after ad after ad, even for puzzles that take literally under 10 seconds to solve. I‚Äôd rather go to a grocery store and buy a puzzle magazine with ads you can just turn the page on. If you have the app make sure you unsubscribe from the app. I‚Äôll be deleting right away"
5,LinaRacer,"I really enjoy the games and puzzles, helps wake my brain up in the morning. There‚Äôs also quizzes that help you understand yourself a bit better! Only thing not too great about this app, is the membership price! Wish it was a bit more affordable. It‚Äôs a nice app, but not one I utilize everyday. Haven‚Äôt quite justified paying that price quite yet. Definitely worth checking out!"
2,Original-IIBorNotIIB,"This app is really cool but it prompts me to pay for premium with every interaction during my free trial‚Ä¶ (quite constant) then I took an archetype test which I was quite curious about the results of and it had me go all the way through (approx. 10min time commitment) just to inform me I couldn‚Äôt see my results without buying premium‚Ä¶ for a free trial, it didn‚Äôt feel free nor like a real trial. I miss single pay apps. üòî I‚Äôm deleting after this review. I get developers deserve to be paid, but where‚Äôs the middle ground? The app itself is well constructed and entertaining."
5,Sommerovertherainbow,"Deleted social media a few days ago. Naturally by habit I am opening my phone only to remember doing so. Downloaded this in place in case I needed something to fill the time when I‚Äôm away from my book and I love it. Simple games, insightful surveys. Highly recommend just for boredom alone. Excited to see the benefits after a few weeks."
3,Mae Valentine,"I took some of the tests and quizzes they have on there. Of course you have to pay to unlock your results. If this wasn‚Äôt a major pay to use app, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. The games are wonderful, and while somewhat limited. I feel like you‚Äôd have to play awhile to get bored of those specifically especially with the difficulty changing every time. We should have access to the results of the tests offered if they are offered for free. Otherwise I‚Äôm wasting my time."
5,D√´ZZ√ø,"I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. It can provide me with insights into myself and my thought patterns while also allowing me to work on areas that I want to improve upon within my mind. Additionally, the fact that it tailors its feedback to my specific gender and age is elegant - it's motivating to see how I stack up against others in my demographic. Overall, I'm finding it to be an inspiring experience."
5,Mikey from buffalo,"Honestly, I enjoy ranking in the top percentile because I‚Äôve always felt like I was little smarter than most people and these brain teasers confirm that. If you are like me and enjoy words of affirmation (even if they come from your own conscience) then you will love this app. It also helps you understand yourself better and your needs so that you can better your interpersonal relationships. Really cool self reflective app."
5,Jrell86,I like that impulse challenge me while helping to improve my brain. I only been using it for a few days and will edit reviews as often as possible to update on progress. One of the games I have to play to keep my streak going is not working. Really hope this is not a reoccurring problem because I have been dedicated to trying this app with an open mind.
3,BKelly182,Overall I like the app and availability of games/puzzles to help sharpen your brain! BUT; there are WAY too many ads and the subscription is very costly. They do however offer an option to eliminate ads without the yearly subscription‚Ä¶or so I thought. I paid $4.99 and THEN found out that the $5 I just paid was only to cancel ads on ONE of the games‚Ä¶nothing else. Disappointed that that‚Äôs not advertised when you go to purchase because that‚Äôs also way to expensive and I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted my money.
5,bractonre,Just trust me this game is amazing if your looking to kill time. It helps your concentration and at the same keeps you busy. It is not something that you can get super carried away either. The app has everything set up for you daily. It will be harder for you too waste any real world time compared to other games. It also has IQ tests and personality tests to inform you more about yourself.
1,Puffin960649,I purchased this app to challenge my brain daily so I can improve. But the games here are too easy and not even challenging. I‚Äôm Automatically in the 99th percentile and it takes so long until the game becomes challenging enough to actually play. I find it boring and the app should adjust it‚Äôs difficulty based on the player but this app doesn‚Äôt. You have to go through all the levels before it gets challenging instead of skipping a level because its too easy. I specifically bought this to challenge my brain but it‚Äôs not even challenging. Not worth the purchase.
5,Peteharold,"I have so much fun working with impulse. It‚Äôs so much fun that I forget that I‚Äôm doing BRAIN EXERCISES. I really appreciate the challenge and with conquering every puzzle I always feel a little accomplished and ready for the next.  Get this app. Pay for it. You‚Äôll find yourself wanting to spend more time with it in an addicting way that is far more healthy than IG, FB, or ANY of the social media or video platforms."
5,PDPablo91,"I haven't quite incorporated Impulse into my daily routine but I am thoroughly enjoying my experience. The games are fun and I LOVE the quizzes! A chance to look inward and get to know myself better is always something I take the opportunity to do and Impulse provides many opportunities to do just that. Great app, I look forward to spending more time doing something productive while my phone is in my hands."
5,zhikimm,"1. I‚Äôm always looking for little fun puzzle games but get quickly bored of playing the same game and puzzles over and over again which honestly most games on my phone last maybe a week before I ever open it again, this one is great because you always get a new game!  2. Challenges increase based on your own ability to complete so it won‚Äôt get too difficult too quick but for games you excel at they will increase the difficulty for that single game.  3. You can go in after daily challenges and play levels on any game you enjoy.  4. They are all games that will help with mental status, increasing multiple different regions of your brain and can be adjusted to however you want."
5,lilchiclen,"Hi! I am 13 years old and I am always looking for a fun way to grow my mind! this game is actually so much fun and really interesting! i always play it before a test and oh my gosh it calms me down and helps me so much, i really have been scoring higher. not too many ads, and I have the free version. at the begining of the app they give u a quiz on what u want to improve on and ur age, so it's great for everybody!! i love it please try it!"
4,":,o",The challenges it gives you are both fun and challenging. I think it‚Äôs really cool that it shows you the statistics of each challenge to show you how you can prove and so that you can strive to try be a better version of yourself. The only downside I would say is that you need to pay for quite a bit as there are many ads and if you do the tests you need to pay to get the full evaluation. Other than that I think it‚Äôs awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,TheMostPulp,"This game has tons of fun components and I‚Äôm training my brain while having fun! The games are styled after popular app games so instead of downloading all these games then abandoning them in my phone when I get sick of them, I can just have fun on this app! I never knew training your brain could be so fun! I love seeing my progress over time and overall my brain has been working better!"
5,Aubrey. M,"Okay so the game gives you different options to play different games! Even if you have finished all of the activities that you needed to complete, it still allows you to continue playing for as long as you wish! You still do have to pay some price for the program, it is still a very enjoyable app and it is actually very fun!"
5,SuperHeartDogGirl,"This app gives you specialized help in whatever your reason for getting the app was. Even if you don‚Äôt buy their membership, there‚Äôs still enough for you to keep your brain sharp daily and improve on a couple of focus areas on your brain. It also tells you exactly how each game is helping you. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for brain games!"
5,tom_thehawk,"It‚Äôs difficult for me to be challenged. Impulse is providing that for me in fun, adaptable, intelligence building ways! The games are progressively stimulating, and with the quick instruction video, I can be clear on how to play before the game engages. It shows how I compared to other users at the end of my challenges which keeps me interested in playing because we all know, that ‚ÄúI‚Äù have to be the best."
4,Material girls!,"This is a great app!!! I love that I get the opportunity to choose the subjects that I want to work on. If honestly makes me feel very calm and optimistic throughout the day. Although I do wish that I could have a option to go back and fix my mistakes in my work that I did, but in a way that is a good thing that I can‚Äôt too because I get to see where my brain started from and how it continues to grow! Overall this is truly a great app I really recommend!"
5,Locustpisss,"Sometimes I feel stupid in life. When I do, I go on impulse and it helps me strategize when it comes to playing their puzzle games. I like the challenges it comes with and how it makes you put in work at times. I definitely feel a lot better mentally when it comes to playing their games. Hope they add more features for free users."
5,MSVB73,My son suggested this training to me.  I‚Äôve noticed this past year I will forget what I just entered the room to do.  I mean‚Ä¶ I was on a mission ‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶Must have blinked in transit because I could not recall what I was looking for.  I‚Äôve just turned 69 and retired 3 years ago.  I think I functioned much better when I got up to an alarm every morning and followed my work routine‚Ä¶. But‚Ä¶.. it IS nice not having to üòÅ
5,Ggeretrrvty,To keep my brain and memory in check in as little as 5 mins per day!! I‚Äôm also for the first time understanding the way my brain and mind are challenged under different types of learning situations. In such a short amount of time I‚Äôve already noticed improvements in my cognitive function. I‚Äôm excited to see long term results as well!! You can‚Äôt go wrong with this app!
5,Derrick X-244fgk7 the 3rd,"I didn‚Äôt know how to function until I used this app, but now it‚Äôs practically like having neuralink! I‚Äôm attached by an implant to a supercomputer that knows but only math and games. I wish to help the world, I just need more people to use this app so that we will have a Supermind army to show the world how great it truly is to be apart of something bigger. a world filled with mathematics, numbers are so fun üòÄ"
5,Tori3022,"I have been playing mental mind games for a while and also trying to find an app that will challenge me. Impulse is worth while! I love the games, tests and the weekly reports. I like to know how I can improve and where I am doing better.   The only issue I have is during the tests, the timer doesn‚Äôt stop and begin between them. Hopefully, this can be resolved. Thank you."
1,Withoutguilt,"I figured it would be free because the add said it was. But it wasn‚Äôt. then to do anything you have to give card information just to open the app?? Also it try‚Äôs to give 3 day free trial I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what the (free) meant. But very disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt even open the app to look around. I had to put a card number in, which is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt wanna give you my card information. You‚Äôre just a regular app that nobody even knows about hardly maybe if they spend all their time on the Internet worrying about what other people say, they know about it. Thanks for nothing."
1,Unhappy..........,"Candy sort on impulse had many issues. The app used to freeze for 30+ seconds upon finishing each level. After the update, the app still freezes for 30+ seconds after finishing each level‚Ä¶but now it freezes for 30 + seconds upon loading each level too. Here it just gives you a blank screen, with the only way to get out is to close the app. Candy Sort became virtually unplayable as each level only takes a few minutes to complete‚Ä¶so you end up waiting for 1+minute for 2-3 minutes of gameplay"
3,Unhappy_2924,I hate writing reviews. But I am because your cancellation process is very well hidden!   I downloaded the app on May 11th to give it a try using the 3-day trial option. I used it for a day.  But couldn‚Äôt figure out how to cancel my subscription using the in app feature until May 13th at 11 pm at which point I was already charged the weekly subscription fee!! It‚Äôs only $7 and change but I am disappointed at how hard it was to cancel my subscription.
5,Arias town,This game is for if you don‚Äôt want anyone or thing to bother you and very relaxing!!!I play this game once a day for 10 to 20 minutes and at the end I feel very satisfied and sometimes even smarter.I love the parts when you have to draw on line game and the puzzles üß© when you have to go in number order!!I have played this game for only a few days and already love it!!!!!
5,Jack j p,"It‚Äôs great, except‚Ä¶  When doing various things, after completing them, a message comes up saying ‚ÄúRestoring Your Progress‚Äù, which blocks your ability to navigate the app. It comes up repeatedly, and is annoying. It should be changed so that this message only appears in the background, or not at all, since it‚Äôs entirely unnecessary."
5,goblin_artistry,"It‚Äôs good for you and enjoyable? YES! I absolutely love this app and I may end up subscribing soon. It feels so good once I complete a game. It‚Äôs not like other apps where I‚Äôll feel drained after or overstimulated, I truly feel like I‚Äôve accomplished a brain workout. I‚Äôm starting to have my father who suffers from Parkinson‚Äôs, play some games as well. He‚Äôs really doing well and having fun while exercising necessary parts of his brain!"
5,kayla2225,"My mother and I both use this, and have been training out brains for a while. The games are fun, but it definitely makes a difference, because especially my attention span has gotten better in school, since I started  using this application. I definitely recommend. If you‚Äôre looking for a brain training game, this is the one for you!"
5,blue eied baby,"I had brain surgery in 2021 for my seizures. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research and self help books to keep my brain working strong. By far this app has me hooked, and has shown me the area‚Äôs that I need to work harder on. One of the hidden gems in this app give‚Äôs steps some ideas to try and build yourself in my (case) I also work with my doctor‚Äôs too. Overall this app has been great for me!!"
5,the1onlyprime,"I love this app because it requires focus, awareness and actual problem solving. Even more amazing than this is the fact that over time having to solve certain puzzles or problems actually makes facing real life problem solving scenarios seem easier. Thinking outside of the box is something that is needed and definitely helps reduce the stress that originates from problematic situations."
1,mchlnrvs,"The app is fine but all the games here can be found in the App Store for free, probably with ads. I hit the trial and got charged a subscription. I reached out to the company and they responded ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt handle refunds, apple does‚Äù and a link that shows you that it cannot be refunded. Just annoying that app is so basic and I got scammed. Brain Age on the ds was the original game that did it much better and of course you would just pay once. The company is Definitely banking on the fact that ppl will click a link, go to download and hit the side button for the trial and then get charged."
5,Mew/power4,"This app has been great fun so far. I e only been doing my daily exercises for 2 days, but in that time I have had fun and feel more confident that I am taking care of my brain health. I have Rheumatoid Disease and it has affecting so much more than my joints, memory being one of them, and I pray this app helps me with that. After playing for awhile, I will leave another update on what I think."
5,Neois_,"Saw this app just randomly scrolling and enjoyed it ever since. All that‚Äôs given without subscription and the length of ads, it‚Äôs all perfect and just an amazing application overall. From the design to attention to simplicity, and also overall use and helpfulness. It‚Äôs something I wish I had for a long time already and overall hope to be using it for a long time!"
5,**Reggie**0192,"It‚Äôs very fun and is very helpful especially for growing minds and is also just a good way to get your mind off things and keep you calm. I love puzzles myself and this game is full of them every time I open the app i am playing a new puzzle. It helps with your spelling and helps you get better at patterns and different kinds of puzzles, and keeps your mind young and smart. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Shakespeare!!!,"Obviously it‚Äôs fun because there‚Äôs different games each day that are relaxing and  focusing on different parts of the brain to exercise. I like how you can spend as little as 5 minutes a day, and you can still keep your streak! The best part is, I actually think these mini games are improving and letting you get to know your mind and how it operates! Over all, I love it!"
1,Eminico,"I wanted to give it a try because I wanted to see if I could do the drawing activity in the advertisement. Before I could try the app, I had to pick a subscription choice that would activate after the 3 day trial.  Well, I downloaded the App and played a day‚Äôs worth. Decided it wasn‚Äôt for me. Went to my Apple subscriptions and there is no way to cancel the trial. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, I already got notification from my payment method that they requested the money for the subscription.  Now I have to deal with Apple to figure out how to cancel the trial and not get the subscription charged. There‚Äôs no way to cancel the trial, so just don‚Äôt download until they fix it."
5,Jwiggi97,"I bought the year long subscription. I‚Äôve been spending about 30-90 minutes each day.  It is challenging and creates opportunities for me to focus and practice critical thinking. I would like to see more people in the over 60 group. It sometimes feels like the group is small. Overall, a good use of my time while having fun. You should try it."
5,SpeedyBlurr,When it‚Äôs been some time since you‚Äôve taken math classes or reading/writing classes and you don‚Äôt use them often you might lose faith in your ability to do these things. If you don‚Äôt use them you lose them. This helps me feel more confident in my abilities to do these things and it definitely helps me think quicker on my feet.
3,Dig mac,"With the most recent update, sometimes the games don‚Äôt load (I get a blank screen, have noticed especially on candy sort), so I have to leave the game and select it again. Also, when moving the very last ‚Äúcandy‚Äù, I have to tap like 10-12 times to get it it ‚Äúdrop‚Äù into place before it‚Äôll let me clear the level. Minor annoyance‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWaaaaaaait foooooor iiiiiiiit‚Ä¶‚Äù üòÄ Still very enjoyable app for passing time and working the cobwebs out of my brain."
1,sessional65,"I finally cracked and got the app after seeing it all over my social medias. I was excited to take some test and do the training as they reminded me of the brain training games I would play as a kid. What really grabbed my attention was the tests, so I accepted the free trial and decided to take an archetype test. Only to find out I couldn‚Äôt get any information without paying. While the app seems good the developers are obviously not as bought in as they would like their customers to be. For anyone on the fence and wanting to test their product, don‚Äôt bother unless you‚Äôre willing to buy yourself through the paywall"
5,GlambitionBeautyMUA,I have short term memory loss due to a brain injury and I‚Äôm always so frustrated with how bad my memory has become.  Downloading this app and giving it a try has been a pleasant & welcome surprise honestly!  I thought it would be something to kill time with but it‚Äôs already truly helping me and keeping my brain thinking which in turn is helping my memory.  Highly recommend!
2,Macklunatic,In the two days i have played/worked on this cognitive stimulate i honestly say my creative side of my brain started up and has been on ideal. That has not stared up in years and it feels good to draw again. On the other side my common sense or simple task side has gone to lunch and took off the rest of the day to go play golf in the rain. Or maybe that side has been like that for some time and never acknowledged. Either way i scored a 1225 on strange signals outperforming 99% of the population and lets just say i scored a perfect 100% on the dam thing. Beat that. Elon musk!!!
5,Human from nowhere,It helps me a lot from the first day l played it was great but sometimes it‚Äôs to hard for me. But that‚Äôs why it making people progress in mind and focus. It‚Äôs a good for children sometimes it talk and bills and stuff but it‚Äôs good for everyone. I left a good review because l trust in this game and more like this game is good for people in general. I hope this game grows and help more people make stuff like this. Have a good day everyone.
4,Ayreq,"Unsure what caused failure. did hitting a wrong tile spell failure, or should you just go on from where you were hitting the correct one next? It appeared to me and some of the later ones as though a whole bunch of tiles that I had clicked correctly reappeared. I I realized immediately that I had hit an incorrect tile, but were the ones that I reappeared ones that had been somehow missed in between a pair or watt. I just don‚Äôt know. Hope this helps."
5,Crash 1972,"It‚Äôs actually quite fun and entertaining. The fact that I am benefiting from doing these games, challenges and puzzles is awesome. It‚Äôs all about neuroplasticity for me. It‚Äôs helping. Slowly but surely, it‚Äôs making a difference for me. Plus, I just enjoy it, and I‚Äôm not one to like let alone bother doing ‚Äústupid‚Äù little games.  It definitely rocks! Didn‚Äôt think I was going to actually enjoy it!"
5,Betseymills,I like impulse in my opinion because it makes my brain work hard and keep its state that‚Äôs best. But some of the impulse games are not as more skill building more about fun. It‚Äôs ok to have fun a lot. but people that download this want to see how much there brain improves. Not how much fun they have. And when I‚Äôm playing I want to improve my brain and keep my mindset. And if you improve this thank you a lot.
2,Liuli79,"I DID love this game. ‚ÄúDID.‚Äù I was happily playing, really doing well, asked for a clue, my clues ran out but I accidentally clicked on the cue button only to be taken to some app in the App Store that it was telling me to download. A completely unrelated app that looked cheap and pointless. I couldn‚Äôt come back out of it. I tried going back in to the Impulse app and every time it just took me to this stupid game in the App Store telling me to download with no other option. I have to uninstall the whole Impulse app now which will lose all my info. Not sure I‚Äôll bother reinstalling. VERY annoying!"
5,yankeedoodle777,"This app is very useful.  Has lots of different types of games to choose from. Daily and monthly training to help keep your mind sharp in many areas. Free play, so you can play what ever game when ever you‚Äôd like. Personally I paid the whole $25 for the year subscription and have played for almost a month now‚Ä¶ have noticed a bit of a difference in my memory capacity"
5,Nate88_2004,"This is a quality group of intelligent games that are good for your mind to test your skills, sharpen your thinking, and just have fun.   I love seeing how I do compared to others and compared to my previous scores. This does a great job at both.   I am sick of all the fake, click bait apps out there. The ads are rarely as they advertise. Nice to find one that does what it says and does it well."
5,kkyylleeaa,"I actually didn‚Äôt mean to purchase a year subscription of this, but it‚Äôs actually really fun!  Super quick games to get your brain going & they are actually entertaining. I have ADHD & do not take my medicine, yet this keeps my attention for at least 30 minutes to an hour every day.   I‚Äôm 24, but this is useful for any age. App is very easy to navigate too!! Highly recommend :)"
3,Razrrow,"So this might be an apple issue. Apps need to clearly state family or not. Can‚Äôt for the life of me why a developer wouldn‚Äôt want it to be family sharing. Its marketing 101, give a little gain a lot. But some never figured this out..  but love the app, wish I could share with my fam, too much $$ not that important.. but thats the developers‚Äô problem.  My kids won‚Äôt pay for this, but there friends might, but they will never know. Update family settings and it just might benefit you."
2,tee carrier,This and a few other apps indicate that they will be a free experience when the purchase option is just GET with no indication that an in-app purchase will be required. The idea of this app is awesome and I wanted to have a few trials to experience what it may be but I was never allowed that moment. Upon launch you are flowed through an introduction and options to set your interactions‚Äîthe glitch is the pay option after that walk-through which was not indicated at the surface level within the store. This deception should not be allowed.
4,LazMommy,"I feel like I reach a state of flow with these games and enjoy the challenge to keep doing better. I like the feedback at the end of each game too that helps me understand where my mind is at and where it can improve. Great app! I recommended it to my kids too. I only gave 4 stars because I tend to only give five if something blows my mind somehow. Don‚Äôt feel my mind is blown, but still very happy with this app!"
4,Tora.Piper5,"I tried out this app and I can definitely tell that a lot of effort was put into it. It would be very enjoyable, if not for the ads and prices. Every other level, there‚Äôs an ad. If you want to actually experience the app, it costs money. I might get rid of it just because I can‚Äôt do much without paying. If the makers of this app would reconsider the ads and prices, that would be AMAZING."
5,Kttymari,"I really enjoy impulse! Since using it I‚Äôve seen improvements in my memory, especially with remembering numbers. My favorite game is Candy Sort, I get such a sense of accomplishment once all of the candies are sorted! The individual brain training is great because it tailors learning to your needs. Overall great app if used only for the games or if you want to do some brain training too!"
5,Pastor DaNova,As a Christian Minister I always seek tools to help our particular group focus as to live richer lives. GOD CONT to Bless the makers of this app that I personal use and sense and experience significant mental growth. Along with other apps this is a great way to quickly stay in line with other serious individuals that want to be conscious within there own existence. Don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶.lol‚Ä¶ read here to stay focused on salvation:‚ù§Ô∏èJohn 3:16‚ù§Ô∏è  Pastor CTAL: Carlos ‚ÄúDaNova‚Äù Villanueva Cort√©s Founder Conscious Culture NOW!
5,N3|_|R0,"I purchased this app as a personal developmental tool. It is one of the most well designed applications for testing, learning, and improving all mental capabilities and skills. It is applicable to almost every aspect of life. It will set you and anyone you share it with for success. This is a recommended one for child development and development in general. Love this platform! Keep up the good work."
5,CandyGurl4725,"Impulse is a great game to play during the summer. It keeps your brain sharp and allows you to have fun while you‚Äôre doing it. My family goes on vacation during the summer and the car rides can be up to 12 hours so having a game like this is great, not to mention all of the mental stuff it helps with. Overall it is a great way to get ready for school during the summer."
4,Happy temp,"Hi. The app was interesting to help me with short term and long term memory. I chose challenging level and each test says I‚Äôve ranked between 80 and 95 percent above my peers. It‚Äôs nice to think that‚Äôs true I guess.. but I know it‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs why I want to use the app. My suggestion would be t make the challenging level harder so we keep thinking we need the app. I‚Äôm going to subscribe be , likely the tests will get harder as I go and‚Ä¶ practice is practice :) thank ya to the developers"
5,Jacob Ali,"Having the strongest brain on earth, after I suffering the worst injury in the history of humanity, 11 brain blood clots, when no one has ever surved more then 7 brain blood clots and they ended up blind, paralyzed, and unable to talk. This app significanly helps keeps my brain sharp and healthy  After suffering such an injury, this app is helping bring back nearly all the memory ive forgotten!"
5,SeveruxDWarlock,"When you decide to get the membership or the subscription for it, you're money will be well spent. At the start of each puzzle it may seem like its very easy and even a trained monkey can do it, wait until you reach a higher level then you will feel the challenge and will force your brain to work more than the usual in a good way."
5,Raeb404,"I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I got this game. I was just bored and saw an ad for it and decided to try it. However, it my second day playing it and I honestly love it. There are so many different games and it‚Äôs so fun trying to do well. It‚Äôs the perfect game for someone who gets bored easily because even with my short attention span I‚Äôve gotten pretty hooked to the game!"
5,BPT422,"You see ads all the time for games that are nothing like the ad, or are poorly made. Impulse is hands-down the best ‚Äúgame‚Äù out there. Actually, it‚Äôs the best suite of games. It has more games, tests, and mind-sharpening , fast-paced exercises then I had thought when I first purchased it. Impulse is a life changer. It‚Äôs fun and useful all at the same time. Thank you to the folks who made Impulse!"
3,Psyclorama,"I have experienced few apps that come for your coin quite as insidiously as this one. ""Want an IQ test report? Subscribe! Don't want to subscribe? How about a one time discount purchase? ARE YOU SURE?!"" Never seen an app push notify you (and I'm pretty sure I didn't accept notifications) after you cancel the subscription and ask for feedback. But cancelling is just one of many ways to get a >90% discount if you're willing to sign up for a whole year. The games are fun, if you can ignore the grubby asks."
5,nurseluvjust,I have been using impulse daily for about a year now‚Ä¶ and I can tell how much it had helped me retrain myself and become sharper‚Ä¶ I make it my goal for  increase my high score in at least one activity a day!! And it gets hard‚Ä¶ but eventually you get it!! And the next time it‚Äôs not as hard!!! I hated math.. even simple math‚Ä¶ but now I can do % off the top of my head!!
5,Tr1pl3BeAmz,"This game definitely wakes up your brain. I‚Äôm only in the beginning of the app and I can see already it‚Äôs going to be a great app. I‚Äôve just completed the trash placement, and I scored 59% compared to others. I thought I was recognizing placement of trash very swiftly and from seeing the percentage, I know I have a lot of work to do. This is a great app and I recommend everyone to try it out!!"
2,Dumas98,This app keeps advertising tests on instagram that do not exist once you purchase the subscription. I paid for it twice wanting to take a particular test I had just seen in the ad. Then when I login and subscribe it‚Äôs not an option or it was never an option. Very deceptive and disappointing.  The tests that are available are very basic and I‚Äôm not convinced the results are accurate. Some of the games are entertaining the first few times. Overall I would not recommend this app. It‚Äôs not at all what it seems.
5,AShearing,I started this to give me something I can easily do while traveling for work that will gyve me brain activities. I worry about dementia as it runs in the family. It‚Äôs exceeded my expectations. The little personality tests to take are helpful as well and seem very accurate. The games are fun and I‚Äôve learned a lot about it aptitudes and areas I used to excel at that I am working to improve!
5,jefrika,"I enjoy this app a lot. I like that the games make me think but they are still fun. I like the daily challenges and how they switch every day to exercise different parts of my brain, I do wish there were more variety for the daily challenges! I really love candy sort most of all. The tests are also very interesting and help me learn a lot about myself"
5,{|~||_|‚Ç¨k=],I haven‚Äôt even had it that long yet but I had a craniotomy last year after having epilepsy for the past 26 years and it did definitely do something with my speech cause it was in front left temporal lobe but either or I can definitely tell a bunch of these are helping my speech and then some things aren‚Äôt necessarily all me but it‚Äôs for sure a good app for everyone
5,Brii tii,"I enjoy this game very much. It‚Äôs actually helped me realize that there are things I can do a little better than I thought and that with a little bit of concentration, I can do more than I allow myself to do. It‚Äôs very fun. It keeps you on your toes. There‚Äôs a little timer but at the end of the day you‚Äôre not being tested it‚Äôs just to help your brain stay sharp."
5,awarren,"Having terrible insomnia, often leads to lots of mindless internet surfing. Until that is, I found IMPLUSE. Now I use this app to improve my mind and the speed to which I understand and react to things. I can actually feel an improvement in my cognitive abilities and motor skills. I love this APP...IMPLUSE is fun, fast and good for my mind! So much better than mindfulness surfing. Thanks to the creators, a job well done!"
5,mkr1993,"I have a lot of gray matter apparently from extensive Adderall use for over 10 years. I take tons of supplements now which help little, so it wasn‚Äôt until I started using my brain from this brain training game that I started having things click faster which has, subsequently, increased my dopamine levels. Which has made me a much happier person."
4,T.S.2001,"I just started this app this week, I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. The only change I would have is the upgrade to receive all information provided. It is about $30 for the year, with the sale they offered. Some people don‚Äôt have the money and some don‚Äôt want to spend that much. I am one of those people who wouldn‚Äôt want to spend that much. But other than that, the app has been great."
1,Mr. Iceray,"Must say I didn‚Äôt really think I‚Äôd enjoy this game nor, did I think it would hold my attention for long. But it has truly been an eye opening experience for me. It has help me to see in just a few games where my weaknesses are. When it it come to short, visual, and even mathematical states are. Love this game already began telling others about it. At fist I also must say that I didn‚Äôt think I should have to pay for this help, but again I must confess it‚Äôs a small price for a great return. Thanks again Impulse. What a great variety of challenges you‚Äôve created here for the brain to expand and grow."
5,The sus dude,"This game is addictive at some levels, and Impulse is improving your mind with every game you play! Very addictive, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can improve reaction speed, memory, focus, cognitive flexibility, visual processing speed, creativity, problem solving, decision making, brain processing speed, and much, much more. I would suggest every parent give this to their kids!"
5,weatern girl,You‚Äôd think there would just be boring tests but no! There are three games that are assigned each day. I do mine in the morning so I can get my brain ready for the day. And after that you can pick! There are also tests but they aren‚Äôt all boring and you don‚Äôt have to do them. You can see which side of your brain is dominate. This is a very great app. You should definitely try it out.
5,fat duty,I think this help a a little because when you are timed to do certain things you realize just how fast or slow your mind works on certain categories I found myself doing a great job in something I thought I would fail because I never been good at it before but turns out it wasn‚Äôt all that bad just need to focus.
5,mfiaprincess22,I love the fact that it‚Äôs a challenge me mentally !and they make it fun n competitive with a timer . They inform you of your score by correct n incorrect answers plus give you a percentage of your score out of a 100. The game also tutoring one time with every level so u don‚Äôt have a incomplete test score ‚Ä¶like they say if you if you don‚Äôt use it you lose it !
1,Jj0721,"Unfortunately, I really couldn‚Äôt even get a good sense of how well this app worked due to the ads. They make you watch ads that are terribly long, and even when they‚Äôre over you still have to watch them again or wait an extended time to close them. A number of times even after I waited for the ad to end, the screen just blacked out and I couldn‚Äôt even play the next game. And it happens between every exercise. I get that with these game‚Äôs developers need to be paid, but this is just ridiculous. They make it almost unusable to the point of paying for it. No thanks."
5,adhd34,I have adhd with a iq of 130 this helps me focus when I‚Äôm not interested in what I‚Äôm doing while I follow the things I love as much as possible reality doesn‚Äôt work that way and as adults we have to do things we are not interested in impulse helps me preform at my highest level by providing me with the challenges I need to improve on the areas that I struggle with and helps me with games to keep my wits sharp
4,Abbyant70,"I like this app, I really like that they put thought into allowing each participant to tailor the app goals. For example, you can choose how long you want to play, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. The games are interesting and I do feel that they challenge my mind in a way that helps improve my memory and attention.     Just be careful about the free trial.  The phrasing is a bit confusing.  I deleted the game because of it."
5,-pointhisout,I downloaded this because I saw it on TickTock and it seems fun and I‚Äôve been playing it for about an hour and I‚Äôm at level 16. It‚Äôs very addicting and you can play cool brain games. And also you can make your brain sharper. I like this game because it‚Äôs is not like Fortnite or Roblox or those games that you can addict to and it would it be healthy. Although this game makes your brain sharper and it‚Äôs fun!
5,SimplyCherii,"Awesome so far!! Using the free version doesn‚Äôt shove paid games in your face like other apps I‚Äôve tried. The ads are short and easy to ignore. The mini games are absolutely amazing and I‚Äôm extremely motivated to keep up my daily streak!! The games are fun, easy to understand, and very helpful for my brain. I‚Äôll come back later to say if I feel I‚Äôve improved or not"
2,spencer775,"I saw an ad for this app. I clicked through to check it out. The free trial allows you one day of ‚Äúgames/tests‚Äù after that you with have to watch long ads on each test or buy the premium for like 6 or 7 bucks a month.   I completed the first and second days and a few extra games. They were interesting, but certainly not worth buying a full version of the app on a subscription basis. Please before you ask for 4 bucks a month less than Netflix. Provide something that has at least 1/10th of its value.   I would not recommend this app at its current pricing."
5,Duke. üßºüßºüßº,I love this app and I just barely downloaded it after I heard about it in an ad. It looked really really cool and don‚Äôt get me wrong it is really really cool but the one thing that annoys me is the test results. It‚Äôs kind of annoying because I would very much like to see my test results for trauma and ADHD but I don‚Äôt want to subscribe. I wish you could at least see the results and coping mechanisms.
5,Herbyaherd,"One thing I must say is this game is a must download. If you ever have wondered things about your memory, or maybe you thought you always had ADHD, or if you just want games to help boost your brain power well then I would definitely download the app. They put in detail and break down details after you get done with a brain test. Check it out"
5,whitwhit1128,This is by far my favorite brain training app I‚Äôve ever used the interface is beautiful and the way it shows you how you rank compared to other people on your level is really interesting I will definitely continue using this app and also recommend it to all of my friends and family even my kids like to play these games.
2,nicknamenumbertwelve,"I recently purchased the year long account with this app because I enjoyed it.  However I recently accidentally signed out of the app and cannot sign back in. It continues to tell me my account doesn‚Äôt exist, but they had no problems billing my card linked to the Apple account.  I reached out to the contact email address that‚Äôs listed weeks ago and have never heard back.  Willing to change my rating if someone could actually help me. Otherwise don‚Äôt get the subscription, you won‚Äôt get your moneys worth."
5,FakeReveiws,"I haven‚Äôt paid for the subscription, but I can still take the IQ test, when I finished, it shows the different ways you can pay for a subscription to get ‚Äúthe full report.‚Äù But, at the top it gives me an IQ score and a classification. My question is, is the score it say my score? Or is it just an example of what the subscription would look like?"
2,fibonocci8,The free version has LONG ads (10+ seconds) after EVERY game and sometimes two in a row. Tries to annoy you to the point of paying to remove ads just for that game but not for all. Places the close ad button in small and tricky places that makes you open the ad. Your frustratingly trying to get back to the game every time. App has a gross and money leechy feel to it. Better apps out there like Elevate and Lumosity whose free versions are limited but don‚Äôt actively try to annoy you into payment and ruin the user experience.
5,mynamehasbeentale,"They took me from my home, fed me dog food and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt write this review and give it five stars you‚Äôll be learning from books again!‚Äù. I cried and begged, pleading for mercy to no avail. This game is wonderful! I love it very much. I‚Äôve been using it for a day and already i can feel the neural pathways opening up inside of me :D. My mind has expanded thank you to these God blessed creators. May mercy be in their hearts. Amen üôè"
5,ImaProphet,"I think exercising the brain is something everyone can benefit from, regardless of age, but even more important as we age & retire from our career. This app makes it really easy to do and fun to boot! I like the challenges to improve and the instant rewards and feedback. I also like the daily reminders to be consistent and the variety of exercises that keep it fresh. I highly recommend it!!"
3,dreamerx22,"Was on my free trial of premium and won a discount as a prize. It was not set up in a way to be clear that activating that now negated your free trial and charged you for the purchase. When I went to cancel it would let me cancel for a year from now. I‚Äôm sure I can go through the hassle of contacting support and fight it, but I do like the game and am just frustrated that it feels purposely set up to have you cancel your free trial and commit to purchase without being clear that that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. Be careful!"
5,Hjvskmw,So the reason why I love it so much is because if you want to be very smart but you don‚Äôt like learning this fits you so well you can play games on here but you are still learning at the same time it‚Äôs crazy and that is why you should download it right away people may say no you won‚Äôt regret it downloading it you got this!!!!!!!!!!üòãüòãüòÉüòÉüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
1,Qweeken1235,"I don‚Äôt know if it intentional, but the intro questionnaire frustrated me within the first 4 questions. Either that was designed as a gate to weed out interest, or that‚Äôs very bad design. You don‚Äôt need to answer 21 questions to try out an app. I only downloaded the app in the first place after seeing an ad referring to a quiz to test for a hierarchy of male roles. The ad mislead me thinking I was going to take said test, but instead prompted me to the App Store, then I was met with many redundant questions. It took me more time to write this review than it did to download the app. That‚Äôs how frustrated I am currently. Highly dislike this."
5,heyyyuyyy,"Do not get this app! It is impossible to cancel your subscription! I have been asking them to a cancel my subscription since last month and they still haven‚Äôt. I have sent emails, since they make you cancel it online if you got online you can‚Äôt cancel it in the app! It‚Äôs so sketchy!"
5,Carolina sweets,I had a severe concussion in my head as the result of a major fall. My memory is not very good most of the time. I have been tested for early onset dementia but doctors concluded I do not have dementia as yet. I have a severe brain injury so my short term memory is not good. Memory games is recommended to train my brain to remember even in a small way. I greatly appreciate these challenges. Thank you.
4,tjlich,"I just started using the app. Thought it would help keep my mind sharper while allowing me morning coffee playtime. I think it‚Äôll accomplish that. No glitches so far. Sharp, attractive, colorful graphics, proper English language is present, easy to follow, fun to play! 5 stars from me requires an ultra exceptional experience. To get that I‚Äôll need the upgraded version and I‚Äôm not there yet. This game is great though! 4.5."
5,Toshwy,"I like this kind of quick game. The science is unproven about if it delays brain aging, but these types of things seemed to have improved my reaction times and memory. And this app - still new for me - is fun with lots of games ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt crash or misbehave. And the paid option is less expensive than some others - with more games. What not  to love?"
1,Hdoanavalbdvd,"Instead of putting every single part of your app behind a pay screen, even while during the free trial, maybe try allowing people to peruse around so they can get a sense of whether or not they actually enjoy the app and it‚Äôs valuable to them. This is very clearly a money grab, you go through any selected test or game and immediately to see your results at the end it wants you to commit to payment. What‚Äôs the point of a free trial if the instant you accept the free trial to see what the app is about already being asked to pay for it. Absolutely brutal would not recommend 0/5 stars."
5,DragoHasTheFire,"Honestly thought this was gonna be another pay for subscription and take tests app. Which it is, until I saw the life time pay once offer and I can say I like the app so far. The games do get harder as the you continue to play them. Plus there are few things you can find out about yourself through the series of tests they have."
5,mutualrespect8*,"So far IMPULSE is pretty cool. I‚Äôm somewhat surprised by the outcome of some, thinking ü§î ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm better than I thought ‚Äú or ‚Äúdang, I thought I was better‚Äù but I can see only good in the out come of this app. I‚Äôm going to switch up to the year payment plan because I feel it‚Äôs worth it, and hey, it‚Äôs a much better deal. Way to go IMPULSE!! I think it would be wonderful for people who have TBI‚Äôs."
5,XYZ4814MoonBeam,"I enjoy playing impulse , it helps to tone down and distract my brain anytime I‚Äôm feeling anxious out panicked. This app is so wonderful especially with the other subjects and materials it provides not only to learn about yourself but to train your brain with actually fun games all while having a very user friendly interface."
5,louisem1234,I‚Äôve been using this app every day for three weeks.  There is definitely improvement in my cognition. I‚Äôve realized that late night is not the time to play these games even if I have insomnia. I am not as quick thinking when I am tired. I‚Äôm 59 and I want to keep a sharp mind so now I retire early and use the app in the at afternoon. Use it-  it really helps!
3,ssoheilmn,"Could you please fix the app so the Today tab doesn‚Äôt keep showing the same games every day? I‚Äôve been playing all 3-5 recommended games in the Today tab for over a month, but it‚Äôs been recommending me from only 5 to 8 of the games. Can you allow users to fully randomize recommendations in that tab, or swap games to avoid monotony? I want to keep my strike, but also some days I don‚Äôt feel to play some of the games again and again."
1,JohnColeB,"Cut to the chase. I spent a handful of minutes answering questions to attempt to give the app a whirl. Once you‚Äôve invested time, that‚Äôs when you get locked into payment options. You can‚Äôt see what the app has to offer or what it is about before donating a minimum of $5. What a shame, or not, no one will ever know. Don‚Äôt waste your time as I have already done that for you. Room for improvement: maybe add a video to give a quick demonstration of what the app has to offer before requesting money. No one minds paying for apps but at least give us an idea of what we‚Äôre getting into."
5,Palm woman,"These have not been proven to improve cognitive ability in a significant way, but they are such fun and exercise such a different parts of the brain that it seems like there is certainly useful, especially compared with playing FreeCell, and the other game that I play exhaustively I am so delightful to have found these. Even the aged cognitive brain instructor agrees that these are worth checking out."
5,ShaNahNah's,"Through the change of life, I found I need to sharpen my mind. I hoped this would help. I feel many times I am just mindlessly on my phone. I found this App is revealing areas in my mind  that are not as sharp as they used to be. It is helping while ‚Äúplaying games.‚Äù It is very enjoyable with lots of variety. I feel it‚Äôs revealing deficiencies and is helping."
5,Anime_Boi_,"I originally saw this in an ad from another app, and I thought it looked alright, so I‚Äôd try it. I ended up enjoying it so much, I subscribed! I love the interface, and the fact that there are so many different tests. The app also tells you what you are working when it comes to mental skills like processing data or writing. I love this app and likely won‚Äôt stop!"
5,kittyplayer44_2009,"This is one of the best apps to stay on track and track your progress on everything from problem solving to mental math to even helping with anxiety, they have fun games to help with everything and helps you stay focused on fun learning I definitely recommend this app if you want to get better in daily life or just see how well you are currently doing."
5,AMBERSMe,"Great Way to Remember What‚Äôs Important in Life.  Simple tasks, games, puzzles to help anyone to feel more content and happy!  :) There‚Äôs always room for improvement.  Education is key, and practice makes perfect.   You can give your feedback about how the games could improve, as well if you want to.  Which, is pretty cool.  You do not have to be a genius to know What‚Äôs up!   It‚Äôs All Good. ‚úîÔ∏è"
5,OCD ICB RN,"If you find yourself addicted to mindless scrolling through short form media and want to stop‚Ä¶ try this app. Set a timer for 20 minutes and do these brain games instead of scrolling, then move onto your next task.   Only suggestion‚Ä¶ for the memory games, try images that have more distinct shapes and colors. Unfair to those with poorer eyesight to have so many similar objects."
4,joe momma_hahaha,"It helps, when you first start it asks you questions and answering them right helps them to know what games for you. And there are so many things I love, one of them giving you tests that helps to see and know what kind of person you are, but one thing I don‚Äôt like is you have to pay, but it says choose a payment plan but you don‚Äôt have to. I have been playing for awhile know and haven‚Äôt spent a single penny."
5,jdhdhdjdo,"For exampleWhen you‚Äôre having the urge to poker prod at me or speak to me, this is a perfect app to play on especially if you‚Äôre needing to use the bathroom because you‚Äôll be going to the bathroom the same time I‚Äôm going to the bathroom I would imagine especially the way that everything is built in my world. I would suggest this app to everyone."
5,MsAriesDiamond,"Impulse help me so much after my car accident, I didn't realize how much an concussion effect my everyday life. So I had to find help to gain more control of things I've lost control of unwilling. To see the low levels and how much how I have gain over one week is amazing. A tearful Thank you to the creators for this super experience that change my life for the better!!!"
5,Mrgiovannibland,I am a 43 yr old who hasn‚Äôt been in school for some time but training within any position I‚Äôve had has always been a must. I was looking for a way to have some homework. A way aside from a conventional video game to refocus my brain in stress. Relief. This is definitely it. I‚Äôm challenged in a way that feels more responsible and still having fun while passing time
3,caspmct,"the most impressive thing about this app is its marketing. they had me buying (literally) into the claims of mental benefits, but after using it consistently for weeks now, i think, if anything, it has probably lopped a few points off my IQ. the 'exercises' are mostly puerile games at the 4th-grade level. and as for the IQ and personality tests, etc., the only people banking on that 'science' are the geniuses who got me to cough up for the annual fee. if the app thinks i'm so smart, how come i feel so stoopid?"
1,Syd Reviews Things ig,"When I download an app and take a long, 10 minute personality quiz, there is nothing more frustrating than being told now you have to pay $38 a year in order to see this. This entire app exists to take money from you by purchasing their ‚Äúplans‚Äù. The options were $6.99 a week, $15 (or something near that amount) a month or $38 a year. Immediately after that, a ‚Äúgift‚Äù screen popped up, saying I can do this for 38 cents a week, which added up to about the same exact amount as the yearly plan, with no option to pay for only a week. Scam scam scram."
3,arykabrel,"i love the game. been looking for something relaxing like this for a while!   HOWEVER. i should be able to get through more than two little puzzles without a 30 second ad between them. it‚Äôs just a little ridiculous! should not have to pay $50 to remove that either. you make it so annoying to get more money out of your customers, and that‚Äôs very frustrating."
4,Exercise your brain man,I just started so everything seems to be elementary to me. I understand the concept for why this was created in the first place which is great but as for now it seems too basic. Maybe as I continue to keep playing and exercising and growing to more levels it would be a bit more challenging which hopefully would make me really have to start putting my brain to use. We‚Äôll see
5,Booman36210,"As someone who never stops working and going to school.... THIS IS GREAT. Not that I've been diagnosed professionally, but I believe I do show slight signs of ADHD (forgetfulness, disorganization,etc.) IT HELPS WITH THAT I SWEAR. Get into a habit of doing the three games every day early in the morning and you'll slowly start to see yourself perform better throughout the day. It's actually crazy how it all works! Try it out!"
1,Ronbon710,"The games are so cool & I enjoyed the app alot (briefly) but I just can‚Äôt with these full minute of the same ducking add over and over every 5 seconds. Plus having to jump thru so many hoops to play anything bc it‚Äôs constantly trying to get you to buy the full version. Can I just try this shot for a week before deciding to pay $30-$50 for a stupid phone app? If you want any test results, expect to pay 5-8$ each for them if you don‚Äôt sign up for the full thing. It‚Äôs more frustrating than helpful at this point. Ended up deleting after 2 days"
5,mathgenius09,"This app is great. It has everything to offer about your brain. What your General IQ is, what personality type your are, what side brained you are and so much more. There are SOME ads but barely any that would make a person mad. I really enjoy this app personally because I have ADHD and it helps me with my social skills and my mental skills such us memory and mental maths. Overall, great app and I love it!"
5,TinoDragon007/11,"I like this app a lot. It teaches me great things and keeps my brain üß† trained, improved and refreshed. Yes, I smoke cigarettes sometimes, which is not good for me, but this app helps a lot and gives me something to do when I am bored just wasting my life away! So thank you team for Impulse ‚ù§Ô∏è! And hey üëã, maybe I‚Äôll stop smoking cigarettes after all, for that is what your app is inspiring me to do. I know this is an act of self-love."
2,rosemaryash,"I just downloaded the app to take tests like the archetype test or personality test. I spent 15 minutes thoughtfully answering 72 questions, only to get to the end and find out that you have to pay to see your results. I don‚Äôt want to do a free trial because I know I won‚Äôt use the app a ton all at once, but just from time to time when I‚Äôm relaxing on a weekend. I really wish they would be clear about what‚Äôs free and what requires payment and not trick you into taking the whole test without showing results."
5,Mama Ruth,"Right away I‚Äôm noticing areas I‚Äôm strong with and areas that are more challenging for me. The games are quick. The results are formatted in meaningful comparison ways that don‚Äôt feel judgemental, rather simply neutral feedback. I appreciate that aspect a lot. I‚Äôm committed to a daily practice for the next month to see what happens. 5 minutes a day for a fun brain training is an easy commitment to make."
5,Spoiled_okie,I had my doubts but this app actually does make you use your brain in ways you might not with normal routines of home and work.  It‚Äôs fun to challenge yourself to get 100%‚Ä¶and you have to be quick and pay attention.  I like this app a lot and definitely give it 5 stars.  It will adjust to your level to keep you on your toes! :)
5,Yehshecrazy so!,"I‚Äôve just started playing‚Ä¶ And so far so good. It actually makes me think and do things that I normally wouldn‚Äôt even think about, but I can tell it‚Äôs very helpful and most importantly it‚Äôs fun and good for me (for my brain). I am of the older persuasion, so it‚Äôs absolutely important that I do things to continuously stimulate my mind. So far I have found just the game to do this‚Ä¶loving it so far."
5,Measured Madness,Some brain training apps have you doing the same thing over and over again but not this one! This one keeps you guessing and I love that. I feel like it engages different areas of your brain in one session. There‚Äôs been a noticeable improvement in my immediate recollection. As long as you put in the work you will see the results.
5,Harloe1006,At first you may take it as just an app but it really does help you focus and hone on to the skills it teaches you! It‚Äôs very informative with the quizzes and even gives you pointers on what you can do help better yourself with the mindset you have and where to challenge said mindset to make it even better and help you find happiness by bettering yourself
5,Inudoshi666,"While the games are initially simplistic, they gradually increase in difficulty. This can help you build a solid foundation for success. This isn't just some children's game. Don't overlook this app because of its' minimalist approach. This app also includes some 'assessment' questionnaires, but do not utilize them as replacement for assessments from a trained- seasoned professional. Treat them as preliminary results."
5,stevennmm,"This game is a great way to pass the time and stay entertained. The ads are minimal and much less annoying compared to other games, making the experience smoother. The gameplay keeps you engaged with a rewarding progression system, and there‚Äôs always something new to do. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and productive game to kill time, this is a solid choice."
5,Panda2Kay,I‚Äôve completed the free trial and I couldn‚Äôt go without so I continued my subscription. The games are explained nicely. I like the range of different types of games for the same category (compared to other games where they have a set game for the ‚ÄòMemory category‚Äô). I‚Äôm not a mathematician now but I can see a difference from before and while playing this game.
5,Danimal33LB,"It is day two of using Impulse and so far I haven‚Äôt had any issues and they design the brain enhancing system to be fun, easy to use and very informative. Next time you go to download a game to play for you or a loved one try this instead and see if you find that your memory, mental health and intelligence are all important and can be improved."
5,midkiffminor,A doctor suggested I find a brain activity to try to help with my memory issues following a viral illness. I was skeptical but the variety of activities offered have helped me use areas of my brain I haven‚Äôt used in awhile and I do notice a big improvement. My doctor is now recommending this app to other patients with similar issues.
5,Mlxdi,"Unlike most games in the app store, this actually helps you build yoyrself up. Moat of the games are really fun.  I would like to request better word games though. It would be amazing if this app also helped one build up their vocabulary by teaching them new words. Currently, the word games just use words and phrases you already know. I‚Äôd love a vocab builder in this app."
5,AlabamaRadio,I had a stroke 4 years ago so I‚Äôm always looking for games to play to get my brain working in ways it may have forgotten and just trying to keep my mind fresh. I love this game because it shows what your working on in your brain with each game and the games are enjoyable to play. It‚Äôs actually an app that I don‚Äôt feel guilty for having.
5,Dream Digital,I downloaded this app thinking I can just delete it if it‚Äôs not helpful like they say. I liked it immediately and bought the year subscription because I knew this was something that would be useful in my life. It took me less than a day to be excited to reenter the app and to know I did NOT want to delete it like I planned prior!
5,The_Serj,I struggle from ADHD these games encourage me and make me feel more comfortable making decisions and helps my cognitive abilities and functionality in my daily task and work. I‚Äôm currently in progress of getting a new certification this application has helped with my focus and studying and please continue to perfect this app
5,N.Cruz :),"I don‚Äôt know how but I am glad they have this thing of making the subscription price cheaper!!! I somehow seem to love this app! It has fun, but challenging brain games and you know you worked out your brain if it starts to hurt. The game just does that! So I recommend getting the subscription so then you can have the best brain training experience!"
4,dovzinia,"This Brain training app is really great for giving your mind a workout. They have all sorts of fun games and activities that help improve your memory, focus, and problem-solving skills. Using this apps regularly can keep your brain sharp and flexible. I'm really impressed by this app! They don't bombard you with ads constantly. I get that they need to make money from the free version, so I don't really mind waiting for the ads to finish."
5,Tori Roos,"I downloaded this from a TikTok ad and unlike all the other ones I downloaded before I actually loved this one and didn‚Äôt uninstall it!!! Im be had it since Saturday ( it‚Äôs Thursday rn) and I‚Äôve been using it everyday for the quizzes, the games, everything and the tests are so accurate!! I love it it keeps me busy and builds my brain. Download it what are you waiting for!üíó"
5,Sheilabeen,"I like this app a lot more than other apps in the App Store for brain training. The graphics are more entertaining, which helps to keep me engaged in the tasks presented to me. The games are also quite cute and keep me entertained as well as engaged with performing well. I wish that this was an app that was a little bit cheaper to use."
5,Mrs Britz,"I downloaded, I played for a bit, I stayed for a bit, went on with my evening. The next day, I initiated work I had been avoiding for months: website work. I think that the experience of the small, bite-sized exercises caused me to see how to work with my web app tools as my partners, instead of seeing the tools as mocking, counterintuitive aggressors within my task."
5,T-Beta3,"This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve used for brain training ‚Äî and I‚Äôve only used the free version so far. There are a nice amount of different games that challenge your brain but still make it enjoyable. I don‚Äôt mind the ads too much, but if I keep finding value and improvement through use of the app, I will most likely upgrade to a subscription."
4,crayons snd crayons,"I have epilepsy and my symptoms have changed in the past few years. The most frustrating  change is that I tend to become anxious when it comes to making the quick and detailed decisions thatI used to be so good at.I then become depressed and feel somewhat useless. So far I have enjoyed challenges and the sense of accomplishment, however small, that I feel."
5,KellyMaddocm,"I am a teen that is constantly stressed and anxious. Once i heard about this app i thought to myself that it would just be like all the rest. It was not. This app is so great because it doesn‚Äôt make you survey constantly and it‚Äôs just games. As a kid, games really get to me and help me. I love this app and use it daily. Even though they advertise the ‚Äúpremium ‚Äú, it is still awesome with out it!"
5,Billdozer1250,This game will have you coming back for more. It gives you great ways to work out your brain. Impulse makes it fun and challenging. And give you ways to take test that tells you a little  bit about yourself. Not true clinical advice but it‚Äôs a start to better understand the way you are and things you can improve on. All in all Great app!!
5,cheapthrills710,It is fun brain training. Some of the games seem pretty easy but they actually do challenge you. Doesn‚Äôt take long and from the research behind it seems like it could be beneficial. Definitely worth the download. Easy way to have some me time and remind ourselves to spend sometime everyday doing something to better ourselves.
3,Dono G.,So my first time using this app the games are fun and interesting but the ads between every game get annoying and their other apps very similar on the market for free where you can do three games free a day without any ads and the game already glitched out I was playing the ancient numbers game and every time you finish it. it doesn‚Äôt actually take you to the home screen or tell you what you scored it just freezes on the zero time left and doesn‚Äôt progress
5,JorgeLro,"I enjoy this app very much , message for the developer : When will there be another update whereby the candy sort game be updated with more plays - the maximum plays of 2500  is already reached .. could you make it 20k plays for the candy sort in your next app update as it is a very good game module for a quick relaxing time . Great work with this app  Thank you"
5,Annis_19,"I downloaded it to get to know about myself, and maybe look at the brain training. And I immediately fell in love with everything in this app. And for those who think you have to pay, paying is an optional thing, not necessarily needed for the app. This is probably one of my favorite apps if gotten in a long time! Thank you for reading!"
4,joi4Him,"Really really like the app, played for a couple of weeks, the only suggestion I have so far is to give give you ability zooming in and out. Often, those of us who have visual challenges need to make what‚Äôs on the screen bigger in order to play comfortable. I especially had issues on IQ test with the little designs. Thank you for all your hard work on this app. Overall it is GREAT!"
5,Ann Liv av,"This app is great you guys should download it. It is a fun puzzling game with math questions and numbers and all other fun stuff so you should really download it and try because I think it‚Äôs amazing and I would say if great were used to this game because it was just like people and there‚Äôs an anxiety test if you‚Äôre feeling down and you think, so it‚Äôs really wonderful.üòÅüòÅ"
5,dakacharlu,"I can feel myself coming back. I played last night for the first time, üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èbtw, and fell asleep after playing and got lots of sleep. Today I accomplished so much and had energy doing it. I haven‚Äôt felt how I felt today in months and the only thing that‚Äôs changed is I played this game for an hour before bed so idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è coincidence? Let‚Äôs see how tomorrow goes! üí§"
5,Rustyr30281,"I used Lumosity for a couple of years, paying an annual fee. I didn‚Äôt really get much insight and seemed to hit an unbeatable plateau. So, I switched to Impulse. This app is not only more informative, offering deeper insights than what I was used to, the games are fun, engaging, and descriptive. Impulse also offers a lifetime membership, so no more annual fees.   I highly recommend this app for daily brain training."
5,foolayjones,"Just the simple fact of wanting to check the status of my mindset on this app instead of being on social media all the time is a great feeling. It sends out the same brain stimulation as social media, but ima actually learning and growing my mind in the short time that I‚Äôm using the app. I love it and would fully recommend this app to anyone.."
5,VicktasticRose,I just got my iPhone and haven‚Äôt really had the time to download some apps and this popped up that it‚Äôs good for my mental health so I had to try it out and I don‚Äôt regret it what‚Äôs so ever. It keeps my brain so focus and instead of getting distracted and thinking about other things. It definitely a most recommended. Plus I‚Äôm autistic so I got told it‚Äôs also a good app for that too.
5,unsweet black mango,So far the app is really good. Playing the free version as they do ask you to buy the app at a discounted price which im assuming has more games and advantages to it. It is a good relaxing game that has you doing multiple things so you are not bored. Definitely a brain worker and i like that. It gets harder as you go along. At the moment I would definitely recommend.
5,Loganberry08,"I‚Äôve ran through a lot of this ‚Äúbrain trainer‚Äù apps. Impulse seems pretty well put together and the price is right. I like the extra features that don‚Äôt come with the other apps, like the personality type quizzes. Keep in mind that these apps are designed to challenge you and are not always the most fun thing to do, but it is great mental exercise!"
5,1CrazyMechanic,So I was hesitant as usual to try any kind of cognitive brain app but let me tell you that Impulse is absolutely enjoyable and it helps sharpen your mind just enough every day. And best of all this all sharpens your mind with fun interactive games and gives you your statistical scores at the end to help you understand where you stand in comparison to your peers. I absolutely love this app.
5,Chemo brain Janet,"After chemotherapy, my thought process was a little slower. I found myself searching for words, memory issues, and some difficulty with math. Other people around me did not recognize it, or think it was a problem. But I knew I was not thinking at the same level I was prior to chemo. This app has been very helpful with my recovery."
5,holallama4456+2,"I think it is a five star because it reminds you of when you should start playing that day so you can keep a streak. I love how it has different games you can play and different tests you can do. There are some challenging ones, some easy ones, and most are very fun! I recommend this app because of how fun and how good it exercises your brain!"
3,"Not so great, little support","Later levels of some games have annoying bugs that require leaving the game . I check for updates a lot but have not seen improvement. Word games contain abbreviated words that make it frustrating at times . Demo instead of demonstration, cam instead of camera, pro instead of professional for example. Repetitive words used as well as conjunctions make it something I will look for other apps to replace this one."
5,Smphotoooo,"I really like brain puzzle games. This app has all the games I have played over the years and more, and I love that instead of just a score against yourself you can also see what parts of your brain you are working with each game type. I wasn‚Äôt going to pay for the subscription but now I think I need to!"
5,Carla Puentes,"At first you might have found impulse because of an ad, like me, but even though it asks you to pay when you first get it know you don‚Äôt have to! Just click the x button and it will let you explore the app! Everything won‚Äôt be unlocked but there is still some fun brain exercises and tests to help improve you and your brain!"
5,Trainer3,"Was hesitant to try this and have been pleasantly surprised. Brain training is imperative for function and this app is challenging, interesting and actually fun. Perhaps it would be helpful as well for those who are getting older to keep the mind sharp, for post concussion athletes to begin the return to learn portion of recovery and those with add/adhd as well.  It is worth your time and energy."
4,Bridgettm011811,"I never write reviews but this is my favorite brain game app that I have found so far, I love the games! The challenge level for me is perfect, not too hard but just challenging enough to keep me focused on solving it. Literally the only negative so far is there‚Äôs like 3 ads of the same thing between each game, a little excessive I think maybe 1 ad max to click out of between each game. Other than that great app!"
5,og bo,"As someone who use to take pride in their mental math ability, I realized that it began to slip due to lack of use. Luckily this app helps me brush up on my skills. This is just one of the many facets of this app. Anyone who is looking for mental test to help with things like memory this is the app for you. On top of all of that, this app can also just be a puzzle app as there is a section fun of fun puzzle games."
5,Phoenixlee13,I‚Äôve only been playing impulse for a short time. But I have noticed little improvements in my memory and my ability to retrieve information. I am a little surprised. I was only playing for enjoyment strictly and have been pleasantly surprised. I will continue to see how my performance compares to my peers. It‚Äôs a good way to pass time while I am waiting.
1,Blizenü¶å,"I took the IQ test and I wanna know my IQ but it says I have to pay for a subscription so I don‚Äôt even know my IQ, There‚Äôs games I wanna play that look cool and fun but I have to get a SUBSCRIPTION just to do them so I ask the developer to please fix this or I‚Äôm deleting the app and take this as a threat oh I also just realized that they put the same developer response on all of the 1 stars and then they don‚Äôt fix it they say we‚Äôll fix the stuff but they actually just see them and do copy and paste and not even read the letter then they advertise you into giving the app a better rating"
4,SnowieWolf34,"The games and tests are good but there‚Äôs too many things that you need premium for. I tried to take a trauma response test so I could help myself get better and I couldn‚Äôt even read the report because I ‚Äúneeded premium‚Äù if the developer sees this, please make things like tests that enhance people‚Äôs ability to live, make them free please. I know you have to make money but I want to help my mental health."
5,Sac);.&:/jp,Had the the trial on my phone and was going to delete it since I forgot about it and never used it‚Ä¶ but played it again and enjoyed it and figure it was a good time killer and like the fact I wasn‚Äôt playing a mindless game! I feel it forces me to have a mental workout! And like they say if you don‚Äôt use it you lose it!
5,6125977,"I‚Äôve only had this app for a little while, but so far it seems to be pretty fun while still being somewhat challenging.  Some of the tests are fairly hard to do well in, but other tests are fairly easy. The games seem fun to play as well. I can‚Äôt wait to explore this app further. Cheers to everyone reading this, and have a good one."
5,Formash,"While it says it‚Äôs for 4+ there‚Äôs only an age range for and up in the app m, and as an 11 year old with a very tough life I would like it to not be saying at party‚Äôs do you communicate or, do u feel s3xy it makes me feel uncomfortable but other than that I basically deal with it because it is a very cool app and god people older than that it will help a lot!!"
5,Blrandy,Absolutely love this app. I‚Äôm not the type to pay for apps when there is a free option but the upgrade was definitely worth it! I‚Äôve been using it daily and love that there‚Äôs quizzes along with the brain training games and even relaxing games. Works really well for stress relief for me. If possible I would love to get in touch about any referral or affiliate opportunities.
1,Zalia zole,"Super slow to load the candy sort game. Before ‚Äúupdate‚Äù it was fine. A little cranky but not too bad. Now I am loosing fun playing it takes so long and buggy too.  Update: its been some time and I got some new updates like stupid celebrations graphics after filling the tube, but the loading issue is still not fixed. Who cares about the extras if one can‚Äôt play. It freezes after every level. And from the comments it seems, I am not alone. So strip all the bells and whistles and just make it work properly. So buggy! It was good before. That‚Äôs weird."
5,AngMoorer,"This is the first brain game app I‚Äôve ever paid for and it‚Äôs one of the best investments I‚Äôve made. A great array of games to play just for fun, and brain ‚Äústrengthening‚Äù activities too. I do wish Impulse created a game similar to the ‚Äútrain of thought‚Äù game by lum*sity which is incredibly addicting and a game I‚Äôve been searching for outside of that app. I hope developers see this!!"
1,nataliaj0,"On a free trial or weekly subscription, you can take tests but won‚Äôt have access to reports and results (which makes taking the test pointless) until you purchase the annual subscription.   Moreover, the way tests are advertised on social media made me download the app; however, in reality, tests, e.g., the trauma test, consist of 40 questions like, ‚ÄúDo you get nervous when under stress?‚Äù.  In conclusion, how the app is presented on social media differs from what it actually is. Additionally, it‚Äôs all about increasing the upsell rate by blocking access to the results of tests taken until subscribed to the most expensive option."
5,OPG1230,"All the exercises feel like games, it is super fun! All the visual aids are great! simple and updated very useful for games where this help rather than distract from the purpose of the game The instructions are short and very clear The games increase in difficulty as you play which makes it non-predictable which I like a lot Love the whole experience"
4,izzasmell,"I love the graphics they r cutely done and it just creates a calming feel, the pacing adds onto that. I def recommend downloading this if you‚Äôd like to get your brain going in an actually fun way :) at the beginning you do have to take a small survey but it‚Äôs nothing serious, just asking what your goals are to grow your brain kinda like duolingo but I can‚Äôt stress that it‚Äôs not serious or nothing at it‚Äôs core it‚Äôs just a fun lil game."
1,App.User.222,"So I bought this app based off a TikTok ad stating that it had a certain test that would‚Äôve been of great help to myself and many others- a childhood trauma test. After spending money on it, the test Impulse advertised is nowhere to be found. Not only is Impulse targeting people who are trying to find resources to work through issues but they are literally false advertising which is an actual crime, it is considered a misdemeanor what they are doing and is punishable in a court of law. I don‚Äôt recommend this app as it‚Äôs predatory due to the reasons listed above and I will be escalating this issue."
5,Chris‚Ç¨¬£¬•,"I rated it a five star so u would see this, all the app will show you is porn ad after porn ad, I accidentally clicked one of threes inappropriate ads and I had to get a whole new I phone due to how many viruses it downloaded after one click, 0/10 this is a scam don‚Äôt download, and developers will not help u or the app whatsoever"
4,JaywayJams!,Everything but the bugs. Hence 4 stars. The app does not keep accurate record of my progress on Candy Sort. Since making progress is a big part of the draw this is a major flaw but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a simple fix. There has been 2 updates since I noticed this bug and it still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Please fix this bug and I will surely return with a 5 star rating!
4,Afozter623522,"So many of the games I see advertised in other games are in this one app. I gave it 4/5 because the tests concern me a bit. They may have a tendency to push people toward thinking they have a mental/emotional regulation issue that they do not, especially people who are young, impressionable, and don‚Äôt know themselves well. But with supervision, they could be a helpful talking point between parents and children!"
5,scarlette carrillo,I downloaded this game because I thought it would be fun for long drives or something but no I did this game everyday it helps me with paying attention and testing me on my math in summer which is so helpful so I don‚Äôt forget anyways if your in the edge of getting it get it it has stuff for ages 13 and up it‚Äôs crazy fun and you can choose what type of brain teasers you want
5,mabeycakes1400,"I really enjoy all of the brain games on Impulse. None of them make me feel anxious or over stimulated and I love how it tracks progress and shows how your score compares to your peers! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a game app that isn‚Äôt just full of ads and time killers, and actually wants to keep their brain young and healthy!"
5,Nast9chelios,"GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! From the start I really like this app, but then I did a mistake and took three day free trial, even though I canceled after three days they charged me seven dollars, I didn‚Äôt react to that, I was like OK it happens. BUT THEY KEEP FREAKING CHARGING ME!!!!!! And there‚Äôs no decent support , so I can message them. The website I found can‚Äôt even send a message!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!!"
5,idk112233445,"I started playing this game just because I like puzzles and I wanted to learn my IQ, but the game has so much more! The games are really fun and I love how everyday it gives you a couple games curated for you! I think this app is definitely worth getting, and if you do, take the IQ test because the results are quite accurate! Great game and would definitely recommend! üòä"
1,1timothyjames,"If you are willing to pay for results, this is probably a great app. I was attracted by an ad I saw on Instagram and thought I‚Äôd give the personality-related tests a try. It is, unfortunately, just another bait and switch, **they have you take the entire 40-80 question test first, and then to receive the results you have to pay for a monthly/yearly/one time fee**. Note for the developers: It would be more strategic to let the consumer receive one result to get them hooked, rather than paywalling them.   I would have loved to have a fair shot at loving this app."
5,LiloP69,"I‚Äôve only just started using this app, but so far, it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs engaging my brain in using info that I don‚Äôt necessarily use on a regular basis, but don‚Äôt want to forget, because it‚Äôs useful. It‚Äôs working on things that I don‚Äôt have time to specifically focus on because I‚Äôm otherwise distracted. So far, it‚Äôs doing exactly what I hoped it would and that‚Äôs a good thing."
3,kmamom,"I've had this app for over a year now. Initially it was a lot of fun; I bought it to keep my brain active. However a lot of the games get WAY too hard to fast, causing me to abandon the game since I can't progress.   Others are great - but after you finish the set of games, they rarely add more to many of them. And seeing ads for tests on Instagram that I would love to take only to go to the app and finding they aren't there is annoying."
4,Jennaming,They fixed the bugs I‚Äôve had issues with since the last two updates soooo relieved. Paying for a game so it was frustrated when it wasn‚Äôt working. I would like to add i don‚Äôt like how the start over button is next to the redo  button. I‚Äôve been meaning to undo a move and forget you guys added it next to the start over entire game. It‚Äôs my only issue
1,Maykitty1989,"Never download this app! It doesn‚Äôt have any way to cancel your subscription and keep charging $6,99/week. I am trying to cancel but the app don‚Äôt have anything to cancel, App Store just have upgrade your plan, but no cancel button, no way to get rid off this terrible app, and the training are not even close to explain why cost so much. So that‚Äôs why I stopped play, and thought I had cancel after the free trial, but no, there is no way to cancel this. Sent email to the support. Waiting the answer, also report a refund on Apple Store."
4,Lizzie E üíô,"There are a lot of really good brain stretching games in the app but there is a caveat, nearly all of the bonus levels have very shallow and upfront answers that don‚Äôt take into account other aspects of the level. Either get rid of the childish bonus levels or do a major overhaul on what a deeper answer could be.  I do have the payed for version of the game so I can not speak on how intrusive ads are in the app."
5,AZ-Dayday,I love playing the app because it‚Äôs fun and I love the pressure of the time limits while also making my brain more stimulated and healthy. I‚Äôm usually not a person to like these types of games but knowing that this one‚Äôs gonna help me in my day-to-day changes everything and I‚Äôve already noticed a big difference in my brain function.
5,Wend-D,"I was a bit skeptical about this at first, but this is awesome, it feels like I am ‚Äúworking‚Äù out my brain. Focus, awareness and memory should still be worked on as we age. Yes, a lot of us rather watch tv or do something else that is more relaxing but these games are very quick and enjoyable to do. A quick 10 mins it‚Äôs all it takes."
5,Emily_Jermey,I‚Äôve hade apps in the past to help my anxiety but that were horrible! When I found out about Impulse I downloaded it and I was expecting for me to pay but I didn‚Äôt have to which is great! I tried the first day and it was amazing and if one day isn‚Äôt enough or you want to do more it has other options for to help you! So that‚Äôs why I consider Impulse the best app ever
5,laxman01736927,I can feel it making my brain function faster. As someone who has smoked copious amounts of weed in the past my brain was truly beginning to feel like pudding. The combination of not smoking and using these games  as a supplement to my brain training has genuinely helped my ability to remember things and do quick mental calculations.
5,Msninja73,"I really like this app because it has a ton of games that are short enough to hold my attention and sharpen my brain and it has no ads!!! (I hate ads ü•¥)  Downloaded from Instagram ad (ironic, I know) but I like it so far.   I find the quizzes a little boring and not sure how reliable they are but the games are good and increase in difficulty."
5,SLCJCJS,I just started using this app. So far it is making me think in ways that my everyday life as a retiree doesn‚Äôt. I keep reading about how as we age participating in games and exercises that promote this type of thinking is so important. I‚Äôm going to continue in hopes that it will keep my mind sharp and slow the mental decline that comes as we age.
5,karbear004,"I was hesitant to spend the money, but this app is worth it! The games are bite size and there is lots of variety. The challenges are satisfying and use different skills so if you aren‚Äôt great at one thing, you can excel in others. Graphics are good and game sounds are nice (not annoying and repetitive like some games). I can definitely see improvement the more I play."
4,3w_z4,"App seems good overall (I am new to it) but it charged me a one time fee to remove ads and did NOT remove any ads after that. I have confirmed it did charge me. The ads are too frequent to really get good use out of this app. They should really only be every 3 min at most but its almost every other game :/ Makes it not worth it in the end, which is unfortunate since this app clearly has potential."
5,ickynikki620,"So I've tried other brain training games. This one actually has many options to focus on different areas.  They're also games, so it makes it fun. Not to mention they do notifications to get you to keep coming back to help improve yourself. I love that its free because some other at this level of self help are not free"
5,didier.wav,"My brain capabilities are pretty below average, according to a test I got done professionally. My brain coach recommended I take supplements along with doing brain exercises. This app, although I‚Äôve only used it for 2 days so far, has been a great way for me to take actionable steps to improve my executive function and help me think better."
4,Music Consseur,"The amount of ads is astronomical. Every level I play there‚Äôs an ad. It‚Äôs incredibly irritating, especially for those who can‚Äôt spend online money to get rid of them. I understand that the app must put these ads somewhere, but after every level? Ridiculously annoying. Overall, this game is very beneficial for me and helps me focus my mind. Those ads are the only negative thing about the app."
5,Viaverus,Take control of the kind of way you want to be. Feel you have attention issues? Can‚Äôt concentrate? Too many things to do at once? Not sure where to begin? Forgot what you were working on? Moving too slow? All this and more can be ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù that can be worked out with this app.
5,Berk1118,"I don‚Äôt work (disabled) and so I‚Äôm stuck in the house all day. I began noticing that my memory and alertness were slowly slipping away. I‚Äôm only 54, and I really don‚Äôt want to get Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. This app really helps! I really didn‚Äôt realize how ‚Äúout of shape‚Äù my brain was until I started playing this game!! It‚Äôs really making me use my noggin‚Äô!!! Definitely worth every single penny!!!     Sandy"
5,MJ Tals n Nate,"I hate pointless games, you know the ones to play monopoly or crush candy! Impulse is different, it has useful games that have a point. Brain power is so important to everyday life and keeping it sharp is very important to me. I highly recommend this app, if you want something more then just playing pointless games!"
1,Ynotottag,"Got the TikTok ad for this and looked into it. Pretty much got smacked immediately in the face by subscription fees and managed to X my way around it all. ADHD test was just asking every single thing an ADHD person does in yes or no fashion and is blatantly insulting. Trauma test is the same exact way. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I was able to navigate around the fees being pushed i wouldn't have even done any of them. There is some content, but nevertheless the only reason it gets one star at all is that the art for this is really decent and it‚Äôs a shame it got used in this manner."
5,Tradrchik,"I love games, I especially love the stats that this app gives me.  Tells me what part of my brain is being worked when doing a specific game!  I‚Äôm starting young so I can keep doing this before I have any decline and this will help develop strong skills in many different areas.  I highly recommend it!"
5,Mattie Marin,It‚Äôs a really good game because it helps with my memory and it helps my brain focus and I can learn on how to become more focused and learn new things and build my knowledge. I can also really tell that the game developer was really open minded and thought he could help open our minds to and I really appreciate that so much so props to the developer. Thank you. ü§ó
5,KayleeP2002,"I have noticed improvement in my mental focus, memory and math skills. Not only do they do that, but in a fun way that makes me want to make a habit out of it. I also enjoy the mini games and puzzles, it‚Äôs just like other games but with no ads. I highly recommend this app, I have tried other brain game apps and this has been my favorite by far!"
5,ReyNegrita,"I paid for the year and I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs only been a few days and I honestly do see some improvement with my memory already. I really appreciate the games too, because they give me something fun AND productive to do when I have downtime at work.  I like that I‚Äôm learning, improving my mind and having a good time all at once."
5,_Hollybranch22_,"Not to overbearing with what you can and can‚Äôt buy right now I wish I could have 5 training games a day free but in the future when I‚Äôm just trying to complete my streak and not anything else the three games is very manageable also like how the achievements only correlate to what activities I can play for free, I love how I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out"
5,Supernatural fangirl one,"I love it, it doesn‚Äôt take too much time to do a daily practice and I feel like it helps me. The app is well organized and if I don‚Äôt understand an exercise, the rules are explained in detail and an example given so I can immediately get the idea. Well worth the money because it‚Äôs a great value! I have an annual subscription now and plan on using it daily!"
5,My5wagga,"Let‚Äôs just say my brain hurts ( in a good way). Sometimes it‚Äôs a good idea to revert back to basics in order to hone your skills. And I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve forgotten how to do a few of the basics offered in Impulse such as idioms, puzzle and memory games to say a few. I am feeling a lot of enjoyment while playing this game and I am glad I signed up for the annual sub ."
5,Luckit17,"Free is convenient, you have a few games to play on a daily basis to train with and I like the evaluation since it doesn‚Äôt put you down at any direction. The games make me feel encouraged to keep coming back for more so I can extend my mental ability & they all feel catered to my own personal needs all while being both fun and simple."
5,Zsazsacat,"I really like the variety of games and challenges that provide the opportunity to test my focus, problem solving, memory and math skills.  The developer‚Äôs response to a problem I had with billing was excellent and the issue was quickly resolved.  I just hope that there are new games on the horizon so the app doesn‚Äôt get stale."
5,World best learning game.,"I was looking for it a app that educates my learning, and I found this, and then I started playing games in 30 money, and I kept my strength, it was so good, I never thought it would be this good, and the features are so like fun and bright, and I also have a good memory games and learning games.  So this is a real review.  In my review, I think it's pretty good 5 stars."
5,Mandi886,The activities are designed well compared to some of the other ones I‚Äôve tried. I will usually sign up for something and do it for a few days then get bored with it and forget about it. This app has kept me interested and coming back. The activities are structured really nicely.
1,Z_Dubs,"The app offers a variety of quizzes and games that are psychological and ‚Äúbrain strengthening‚Äù. The game are at best mediocre, while they can be enjoyable at points and times they barely help improve cognitive function. The tests are all very flawed, for example the ADHD test lists around  73% of people as moderate to severe signs of AHD. This is just statistically incorrect. The other tests aren‚Äôt much better in there overly generalized category's and inaccurate descriptions. overall the app is made to be entertaining and enjoyable, the app is not made to improve your brain function or accurately test you."
5,SpookyMorq,Listen I never write reviews but this application is so much fun it doesn‚Äôt even feel like brain training ! I bought the lifetime access within an hour of downloading the application because I know it‚Äôll be worth the money and this application will be on my phone for years to come! Couldn‚Äôt recommend more!
5,Kodirene,I have used Impulse for 87 days. I enjoy the daily games and the tests. I find myself mentally prepared for the early mornings before heading into work when I do my daily workout. I have learned something‚Äôs about myself and surprised how accurate by some of the test results that I have done. The games are great for short spurts of mental breaks during the day.
4,Mom dog lover,"Please change your games so that they are unlimited. For example: On your word puzzle game, it is limited to a thousand games and I wanted to do more of them. I think since I pay for this app, you shouldn‚Äôt limit it. Also, the game where you move the balls around in the tubes, you also limit those games too. Please change this or I am not going to pay for next year."
4,ofcomeon,I really enjoy the many options for keeping my mind sharp as I age. One big drawback for me being partially color blind with this app is the word guess game. This could be a favorite if there was more contrast between the yellow and light green used currently.  I see nearly the same color and it makes it frustrating since I can‚Äôt determine if a letter is in the correct position!
3,totumos,"I love the challenge, I got it because of the ratings and because of the public support. BUT, how can it be possible that after all this glory there is no one to answer or to fix a glitch in a game?  I‚Äôve sent 3 emails to ‚Äòleave feedback‚Äô because there is no ‚Äòreport a problem‚Äô email. No one has answered, no one has fixed the problem to the game ‚ÄúCandy sort‚Äù, frustrating!  Thank you if you respond."
5,billyrussell,"I enjoy the daily reminders for a quick test of fun. Each game is different and not so mind boggling. Although you are sent sale prices for weekly memberships, the cost of living right now is so high, I have to choose. Unfortunately paying rent, and food for the family comes first. I will revisit the thought when the economy is better."
3,Dmcamacho13,"The tests are ok. The games are ok. The definitions they use in Word Ninja are absolutely abominable. It‚Äôs more of a word scramble than anything else as the definitions almost never make any actual sense with the given word. The Words search runs out of levels too early. And the Words crossword is quite possibly one of the most frustrating games I‚Äôve ever played (and I don‚Äôt mean that as a compliment). Honestly take it or leave it. It‚Äôs not terrible, not awful, but not wonderful either."
4,ClaybourneAlley,"Great brain game trainer. It‚Äôs nice feeling like the app is genuinely targeting your areas that need improving, plus the personality tests are interesting and fulfilling; I guess it satisfy a that desire in all of us to have specific attention to us, you can target exact areas and know more about yourselves,, 4.6, some of the features and design need to be more seamless and unified but the app content itself is top notch."
1,Momiji523,"Subscribed to this app before doing my due diligence. There is no scientific evidence that brain training apps do anything to improve brain function or delay cognitive decline. They will improve your performance with these particular games, but that‚Äôs it. And there is no refund if you change your mind. I purchased a 1-year subscription, so now I have paid for an app that I won‚Äôt use again. Of course, I can continue to use it until December of next year but that‚Äôs kind of beside the point. There‚Äôs little chance of me using it anymore and the money is gone."
5,Atak_Oteng,"This is a very solid app. I like that there‚Äôs different games. I‚Äôm curious to see if there will be any new games developed. Overall satisfied with the app and UI is very user friendly.   The word search is very easy regardless of the level, I wish the developers made it more difficult. It would be nice if app had some kind of brain game with classic playing cards."
5,StrongIntelligentWoman,"Best brain training ever!  If you ever play any games you will want to play these!  For me - I‚Äôve never really been one to be able to do math in my head beyond simple numbers and actions, though now I am able to do slightly more complex math!  It‚Äôs the small wins!  Plus these are just simply the funnest games!  I feel like I accomplish something when I play them!"
1,chi vfh,A twisted ad for a pornographic game depicting a sexual assault just came up while I was playing this game!  The game is rated for 4+ years!  Do NOT let your kids play this game!!  I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other game and am shocked that the developers of these games are allowed to violate a poor unsuspecting child or victim of sexual assault with stuff like this in their ads when they‚Äôre expecting to play a fun and innocent game. This app needs to be taken down until the developer fixes the problem - other reviews have noted the same issue.  I‚Äôve sent a report to Apple.
1,Beaster23,"This app is unbelievable. Make no mistake, this app doesn‚Äôt improve your memory or anything else it claims to do.   The games are all unbelievably simple, and serve only as a nice little dopamine hit, a little pat on the head for completing petty little tasks. In exchange for giving you your little reward, all they ask is little monthly subscription fee.  This isn‚Äôt a brain trainer. It‚Äôs more akin to a slot machine, where you pay to receive a ‚ÄúGood Job!‚Äù rather than a chance at winning money. It saddens me that they can sell you such a thinly veiled farce, and saddens me more that so many people buy it."
5,Randi Marieü¶ã,"Never would I have thought that a game would challenge and stretch my brain so much. This game is beneficial to my everyday life, by exercising my concentration and decision making skills. It‚Äôs even fun to see how much I thought I had life figured out until this game shows me that I need more work lol! Definitely download this game if you‚Äôre looking to maximize your brain power!!"
3,IdnKoGs766,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, all of the games on this app are amazing and work perfectly. For someone who doesn‚Äôt want to subscribe.. how could I relax and feel less anxious when there are so many ads popping up. I‚Äôm not talking rarely, this is constantly. After moving on to the next stage ads come up and to get rid of this I need to pay? ridiculous. You already have so many people playing the game, why add advertisement? it just doesn‚Äôt make sense."
4,plsfromsarah,"I'm sorry, but can a dev direct me to a how-to video or something on how to defeat level 50 of Candy Sort, because I am genuinely convinced that it's impossible to solve. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars (sorry!). Otherwise, the app is nice! I'm sticking to the free side of it, and the ads aren't terribly intrusive, so that's neat.  Level 50 of Candy Sort, however, is not neat. It's driving me insane. Help."
5,mr steal ur bones,"y'all i'm completely hooked to this game specifically, it helps me destress and I can't even remember how many times I've gone over all the levels. pretty please can we get some new ones? I know we just had an update a little while ago with more levels but I just really like this game and they get harder the more you play"
5,IeshaDivine369,"Impulse really improves my focus and memory. I know how after I play Impulse the night before work it‚Äôs easier for me to remember 2/3 orders that I have in 2 minutes. Usually I‚Äôll have to read the board to go over the order twice ( sometimes three times lol ) if I see progress anyone can/will. Just give impulse a try, I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.  Darian J       - from Pendleton SC"
5,Aquena71,"This is a quality app.  I have had neuropsychological testing done and this app has skills to practice that help me maintain my processing speed, memory and math skills.  I just started this app a few days ago.  It never gets boring.  Great for ages 10 (basic math and reading) to any age adult.  I had a stroke and have some cognitive issues plus ADHD and this is a fun way to keep sharp."
5,CALEB THE SECOND,"It‚Äôs a great app especially for someone like myself who has trouble remembering and paying attention to things. This app has really helped me think and remember things much faster, I would definitely encourage anybody to at least try the app it‚Äôs fun and beneficial what else could you ask for.  :)"
5,ccccc3333333,"I just started using this app and I can feel my brain working, I know after a year of consistency my brain is going to be far more advanced thanks to this app. If you want to think more clear, solve more problems with ease, and even impress those around you with your intelligence, then you have to download this game."
2,Citrusslicer,"I saw the ad for the trauma response test and decided to look further into this app. After reviewing the reviews, I thought sure, I‚Äôll download this and even pay the $50 for it so I get the full experience. No where have I come across the same test from the original ad. As a psychologist, this was what originally intrigued me. I appreciate the brain training and other tests. And while it is a fairly well designed app, it was misleading to get me to buy the app to begin with. Not what I was expecting at all."
3,TreblEric,"I was initially excited to see what looked to be a solid brain training app, but then quickly found out it‚Äôs not free. This is a subscription based model after a free 3 day trial. Had I known, I wouldn‚Äôt have even downloaded it to start.   I‚Äôm a fan of transparency and should have known that it was too good to be true. Can‚Äôt really give it an honest rating because I have not used it, but just be upfront with people rather than luring them in."
5,Kaia7612,"I love this app so much it trains my brain and is so much fun. It helps me when I have a day iff and don‚Äôt have to do a lot of thinking, that way my brain is still developing. I use this app all the time I feel like my brain is growing ever time I use it. This app is great to set mind goals and learn how to focus more and do many other things"
5,AstuteCavaet,"I‚Äôve been using the Impulse Brain Training app, and it‚Äôs become a part of my daily routine. The games are genuinely fun and challenging, and I‚Äôve noticed my memory and focus improving. It‚Äôs a great way to keep my mind active, especially during breaks or downtime. Definitely worth a try if you‚Äôre looking to give your brain a workout!"
5,La-la-laa-la,"I found this app by accident and looked it over, read what it was about and thought.. well it‚Äôs better to do this than something mindless like video slots!  Started it and absolutely love it!  The tests are kinda challenging actually and as far as the quizzes about personality, so far they have been spot on!  Highly recommend!!"
4,User 144763,"Impulse is a very nice app. Highly recommend. Lots of tests and games, includes daily recommendations. I enjoy using this app. I didn‚Äôt know how fun brain games are until I tried impulse. I have used other brain training apps before and this is the best so far. The only reason it doesn‚Äôt deserve 5 stars is because without the subscription you only have access to a very small portion of the games ."
2,JMay901,"I have subscribed and played the games on this app for a couple of years and it seems like every update makes the program worse. The most recent changes make it effectively unplayable. When you finish a level and hit the next button, nothing happens. You have to force quit and reopen the app in order to move to the next level. At least in the candy sort game. If this is not fixed in the near future, I will not be renewing my subscription."
5,Sub To Mr.Noodles Adventures,"This app is very helpful for people with ADHD and to relieve stress and to calm yourself down, I advise you to do this before you go to bed as a bedtime routine. Also this app has many games to try to calm yourself down BUT‚Ä¶ Like you could guess there is many ads wich are very annoying. Also there are many advertisements to pay to get premium stuff."
5,ksuesunshine,I can feel my brain absorbing the practice and training to be prepared for the aging process! This is a great app and I find myself wanting to do more with it instead of forgetting about it like I do most other apps of a similar nature! Only my second day but I am enjoying challenging myself and pushing myself to move on to further games. So far so good!!
5,Hyper-Editz,"It has helped me a lot with my memory and problem solving! Though it's sad you need a subscription to see the detailed reports from the tests but that's okay, I get it! And there are a lot of ads and it's very annoying, but at least you don't have to watch the whole ad. Overall it's a great app!"
5,Nausetry2,"I enjoy the tests a lot.  While I‚Äôm not sure exactly what to do with the results, it is interesting for sure.   Just started the brain quizzes and other items.  Got the lifetime deal on sale so happy about that, though missed the super sale!   Oh well.   Fun app overall and if it helps even a little then I‚Äôm happy."
5,The indelible hulk,"This has been a great app for housing all of the little brain exercise games I enjoy doing. Also having a toddler, I know he‚Äôs going to be playing a lot of these development games in school, so I need to brush up on them myself. I wish there were a few more long form games like logic puzzles, crosswords or sudoku."
5,Ashj25,"This app is full of interesting, challenging, engaging games that you can do in less than 5 minutes. I‚Äôm very competitive and love to se how I did at the end of each challenge. This challenge makes me want to go back each morning to try to see how much have I accomplished. Love doing this in the morning with my coffee before starting my day."
3,Beomsbbg,I‚Äôve been using this app for a while and i used to spend long amounts of time on it and have a few ads here and there now I have so many ads that I can‚Äôt play a game or finish my daily brain workouts it‚Äôs came to a point where I can‚Äôt do anything without it glitching from so many ads and after I watch an ad to get to an game and I finish a level (even quickly) I have to watch another ad and it glitches
5,koolaid girl333,"Impulse is the beast training brain game ever! It is educational, but also very fun! I love this game it is so good, it is also very attractive I love playing this game it is very good for the brain and very fun! Everybody in my family plays this game and finds it very fun. I just got to say 5 star! I can‚Äôt believe it is fun and educational at the same time, and it also has no bugs can‚Äôt believe it! I love this game."
5,B06/11momma,"Instead of focusing on negatives in life, that you can‚Äôt control, work on you and your brain! It‚Äôs a positive you can control in your life. Your brain, your life! Our brains are muscles too. We work out to keep our muscles toned, so why not work out our brains?! Memory loss happens as we age. How do we keep it sharp? Play brain games. Better your brain!"
5,Edithfl,I‚Äôve had two concussions and this has affected my brian in so many ways. I been looking for the right app to help challenge the areas I need to stay sharp. This app is helping me so much. My brian is able to problem solve and also allows to see areas I need to work on. It also has helped my brain relax after a difficult day.
5,Shobrina Johnson,"There is a large variety of games to play. I don‚Äôt like buying subscriptions for games, however this one wasn‚Äôt too bad. Paid about $30 for a year subscription. Again, I‚Äôd prefer it be free, but not a horrible price. Definitely uses your brain for most of the games. Very fun and makes me feel like my brain in being exercised."
5,Banks1459,I never play games in my phone.  I stumbled across this little gem and my brain is successfully recovering from the brain cells I‚Äôve killed from beer drinking.  Just when I thought I needed to slow down on the beer consumption this brain training exercise came along to allow me to continue to crush the cervezas-thank you developers!!!
5,a719va,"I‚Äôm 37 years old and I feel old so I just want to make sure What I feel is not actually. But yet it‚Äôs just me needing something to keep me sharp. This helps, again so far so good. Competition is always good knowing your doing better than most at your age, then again it‚Äôs all in your head. Keep sharp, don‚Äôt let your brain fall short"
5,JoeFrat1,"I gave them a suggestion about updating a game, they completely ignored ignored the issue, and proceeded to develop the game in to utter trash, pun intended. Go thing I don‚Äôt have to pay for this app since I payed for a lifetime subscription when it launched. I‚Äôd say if you want to keep customers, listen to them, otherwise it‚Äôs bad business."
2,kell7371,"Just another ‚Äúfree‚Äù app where you get into it and start trying things out then you get hit with a payment wall. You waste your time taking their quizzes just to get to the end and find out you have to pay MONTHLY to see your results. Who wants to pay for a subscription on an app? Just charge for the app itself and your numbers just might go up. With all the streaming services milking us for our money, most can‚Äôt afford to hand another app more money every month."
5,blue skyys,I love this game if u are in school and u have a upcoming test this game helps u remember where things are and trains ur brain to remember what u learned in class this game is fun and whatever u wanna work click on it in the game and it will be the games number one priority on making sure u know it I most definitely recommend this game for anyone and any ages

4,avame gril,So the title there‚Äôs so many options with premium too many. If I don‚Äôt wanna pay then I waste and hour of my day to see my iq score just have to pay but I don‚Äôt want to if you could see the scores for free the it would a 5 starts but until then if 4 because I‚Äôm NOT paying to see it and i don‚Äôt care if theirs a 5.00 option I could use 5 dollars for something else
5,Sweeth0neyz,The games are unique and attractive. I would say that they should always make new puzzles instead of doing the same concept but different puzzles to keep you interested. And there should be some rules about gaining hearts. I don‚Äôt understand why I stopped earning hearts even when I did solve puzzles correctly on the first try.
5,Lenninhymer,I‚Äôm so happy for it‚Äôs scoring so much I just can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs happening! My birthday is December 10th 1984 and my first name starts with the 12th letter in the alphabet and my second name starts with the tenth! As for 1984‚Ä¶ 1+9=10 & 8+4=12‚Ä¶. And then they have the same number as my very first score which was the first perfect score of the first game and I swear to you that my score was 1210
4,Emilya08,It‚Äôs honestly pretty fun and is a quick and easy thing to do daily to sharpen your brain which is surprising to me because I‚Äôm not good with doing anything that I find slightly boring daily‚Ä¶. I also never rate apps cause I think it‚Äôs a waste of time but this app is definitely worth it!!! Also can you guys lighten up on the ads there not to bad just less would make it a whole lot better.
5,HeavyHittaFocus,"The app is amazing. Better than all other brain training apps I‚Äôve used thus far. I was in a car accident in 2009, since which I‚Äôve felt like my mind has slipped every year. This app has sparked some change in how my injury is healing. Before I started using this I felt like I would fade into nothing. Now I feel like there‚Äôs hope."
5,antoniofarias,"This app is not just games and lost time, it is also a great way to be keep our brain from withering away so easy, the games are simple yet fun and not so easy as one would think and a sort of schedule design to maintain a program of exercise to be well round , all in all a very recomendable app to kill time and maintain a well functioning brain"
5,Teresa m Nies,I have had several brain training apps. This by far has been the most entertaining. After a while I loose interest but this app offers different game challenges daily. I also enjoy the option to play without purchase. I have not made that leap yet but every day I play I‚Äôm closer to making that purchase.
5,KitBoBit!üëÅ,"Impulse has been adaptive and fast paced fun. As someone who plays console games like Xbox and PlayStation titles, this is actually entertaining as an education tool. It contains something I think most phone games are missing in pizzaz The ads are tolerable if you‚Äôre willing to use just for training, and not to pay for the ‚Äúfull features‚Äù section/membership."
5,Improving my focus and memory,I realized that I need to work on my focus and memorization while also challenging my brain to learn new skills. This app is perfect! It only takes 10 minutes a day but has hundreds of other resources and games that I can work on and explore. The app is informative and easy to use. I highly recommend it for any age!
5,meaggymarieb,"I have ADHD (diagnosed at 36) and i find the older I get, the worse my symptoms become.I have been looking for something to help with my focus, attention span, recall, memory‚Ä¶. The list goes on and on! üòã This app has addressed all of these things, and more. I am learning more about myself as a person and it is fun! I definitely recommend!"
5,atj1995,"The app was working totally fine and I loved it. But now for some reason it‚Äôs making me sign in every time but Signing in isn‚Äôt working even tho I have a subscription. The email isn‚Äôt registered? Idk what‚Äôs happening.   But once I get through that, the games and puzzles are absolutely exactly what I need and want."
5,Roperap,"Starting the day off with a series of brain exercises has become part of my morning routine. Puzzles, word games, and math questions can help jumpstart brain activity and improve coordination. And it‚Äôs all under five minutes! The additional personality traits and IQ tests are also a fun way to explore how your brain performance stacks up."
5,gzemer,"Impulse has been a fun and quasi productive way to start the day for me. It‚Äôs helped me feel sharp each morning, best especially those days when your brain doesn‚Äôt immediately turn on when your feet hit the bedroom floor.  And it‚Äôs satiated the impulse to be on my phone without getting sucked into the doom scroll of social media"
5,KimberlyAnnFord,I absolutely have so much fun with this game because it has a variety of ways to entertain & really keep your mind busy! I‚Äôve been enjoying these games so much! Some are faster than others but that‚Äôs what keeps the brain engaged & happy! lol This has been a great experience for me so far! Thank you!
5,Chimi119,"I find it hard to be motivated sometimes to do anything. This game starts you off slowly and progresses to push yourself without realizing you‚Äôre actually getting better brain stimulation. I sleep better, that‚Äôs actually why I started doing these brain activities. Just try it, what have you got to lose really?"
5,PeachySS16,It‚Äôs honestly great. I love that I have a few quick games designed for me and what I want to improve on. I love that there are other games you choose from that help with memory and quick thinking. I also love the quizzes that help me better understand how I function and who I am as a person.
5,sjksksw,"i been using this app and I like it so far. however, i notice out of 9/10 games i play i always get ‚Äúyou scored higher than 90 percentile in your group‚Äù. sometimes I get 99 and I‚Äôm confused since my memory and brain power is very much lacking. I wondering if the stats are really true. besides that, its fun and easy to use."
5,Maya Dousharm,"Impulse is a great app, with fun unique games that can test your brain in all different ways. Either you have some free time to spend, or you just wish to play for your daily training. While also having a remind system that ables me to remember to practice, and the daily training system has helped my brain grow tremendously. üëçüëç"
5,MarvelMari24,"This game is so fun, it makes me feel organized and the games are fun to!  I love the rush of adrenaline when a timer starts it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a situation and I save the day! Basically like a hero, also this game lets you skip ads in only 5-10 seconds it gives me a warm cozy feeling as well there are literally no downsides I love it 5 stars!"
1,Nikinikiniki467443,"If you‚Äôre just going to have content blocked off, only available if you pay‚Ä¶  The cost of app seems like a decent deal, content is interest to me‚Ä¶ but I want to see what I am paying for! I used less than 5 minutes and now I will delete it.  It‚Äôs not like you have a free version of the app available, it‚Äôs a very small 3 day trial, why not make all your content available so people can make a decision.  There‚Äôs way too many crappy apps out there, I‚Äôm not going to take a gamble and hope what you offer is worth paying for."
5,Mkatz4,"I actually put off playing it after I downloaded it (randomly) but while waiting One day I gave it a try‚Ä¶‚Ä¶And I was surprised , pleasantly I may add. I enjoyed the short games and they made me feel like I was taking a deep cleansing breath but in my brain (make sense?) Alsomsee how I outperformed 99% of others in my age group or 89% was super awesome!"
5,Poot Moodigan,"Working your brain this way is the same way my grandfather staved off dementia by doing puzzles a few minutes everyday. Whether it was crosswords, word searches or mazes, my grandfather never lost a beat mentally well into his eighties. This app makes you feel like you‚Äôre working out your brain a little bit each day. It‚Äôs wonderful."
5,cuurly kales,"It is an app that I am extremely proud of my own mind within, that‚Äôs absolutely remarkable to someone recovering from such a horrid time in her own mind with no support around to help see the hidden gems of the mind. 10% working it‚Äôs ways beyond, this app allows for me to notice the extension in the brain cells with emotions. Thank you. - üï≥üíì"
4,superpup1019,"i never thought i would say this but wow i‚Äôm amazed by this app!! i‚Äôm 14 and my mom wanted me to start working on brain games and I came across this one, I love this app it definitely does help challenge my brain I absolutely love love LOVE the games they have on here but it does have a downfall, after each round you get an ad which is a bummer because most of the time it‚Äôs the same ads over and over and over."
5,deadpool_88,"You know you have those days when you are bored and you just don‚Äôt want to do the same boring stuff all over again, well this app makes your time fun you feel active. It will also improve your mind it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs easy level you brain is making function."
5,Pershia Baravi,"So, hi :) I‚Äôve been someone who has been stuck doing work and video games almost everyday, never with the motivation to improve myself and I felt my brain was loosing the capability to process things with good functionality as it used to when I would go to school. So having this app is making me feel like I am slowly bringing that back :)"
5,Wild Maple,My son and I both use it and I notice with him he is active and talking and having fun the whole time compared to video games where it literally feels like they hijack his mind. This is quite the opposite. It is stimulating in a beneficial way. His mood is better and he is thinking faster! Thank you to whomever created this! Thankful I found it!
1,Morse Code of Doom,"There's an obnoxious ad after every single level of every single game. These are timed ads so you are stuck watching them for 30 seconds before you can cancel them. After that, you have to wait on a different timed screen before you can FINALLY close the ad, and you'll then be redirected to the app store. To make matters worse, adds are for the same equally obnoxious garbage games like solitaire and homescapes. Get this app if you want an endless loop of pointless advertisements. Get literally ANYTHING else if you want to actually do something other than generating ad revenue for this developer."
5,emusimm,"The simple brain teasers help sharpen the way we think. They‚Äôre quick & fun. Also great for de-stressing or to shift your thoughts when stuck on an idea.  When I tried it for the first time, it tickled the folds of my cranium silly, and I could actually feel the bajillion neurons bursting with woah!   So I guess I like brain teasers & puzzles. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow. #mind-blown"
5,Somebeachsomewhere,"It‚Äôs a great game and keeps you thinking, some might call it a tool to hone and sharpen the mind. I like to call it fun. Much better than wasting brain cells on some other pointless app. Speaking of other apps, I would like an iPad version to make it look even better on the big display. Cheers and use your brain to figure that one out. Thx"
1,jxsuscastillo (jic),"Big money grab! They tried to charge my card twice when I didn‚Äôt want the subscription at all. If you don‚Äôt want ADs, you have to pay for NO ADs in every game INDIVIDUALLY! Many people have fallen to this scam and have reported it here. You can take many tests for free but to see the results, you must pay. Very sketchy, definitely taking advantage of people. I spot a lot of fake reviews on here to boost the algorithm! You need to sign up for the trial or pay for the subscription to even start using the real app. Definitely many better apps that are FREE to use."
5,Birdyghostly,"It‚Äôs annoying that you only get 1% of the results for the tests with the free edition, but it‚Äôs fine I guess. The games are very engaging and refreshing for my brain though! I would recommend this app for someone that struggles with focus or wants to sharpen their brain. I have ADHD and this helps when I use the app before homework."
4,beezneeezz,"Truly an amazing app, only thing I would change is making it easier to log on. I have paid for the app but I can‚Äôt seem to log on to secure my info and profile. Other than that, it is everything you want in brain games, puzzles, and accurate testing with ‚Äúclinical like responses.‚Äù Very amazing app! Highly recommend if I could fix the other problem."
5,kite1234,I like the challenge and that it is quick but accurate. Only issue is that the games/challenges sometimes don‚Äôt tell you anymore what you are supposed to do but figuring it out is a challenge alone I appreciate but I do sometimes have to start over due to the lack of information.
5,postalxbreakdown,Premium version of this app rules.  The mini games and challenges are near unlimited which is also rules if you have a short attention span. I find myself burning away time where I would have been doom scrolling locked into this app which overall is a huge plus in my books.
5,HARR411,This app has kept me motivated to do these activities! the activities are easy short and fun in my opinion! The best part is it helps me with everyday life! It‚Äôs just 3 easy activities each day! You can choose what you want to work on and what you don‚Äôt! And set a goal for yourself! This app is free in the Apple App Store but with adds.
1,CaliforniaKayla,"The three day trial access is a ploy for signups: Users do not have full access to the application and tests results, e.g. the Archetype test. During the trial, I took the test, and the a pop up for an in-app purchase appeared for $6.99 in order to view the results during the trial period‚Ä¶ I declined, but was still accessed $6.99. The punchline? Even with the charge, I have no access to view the results or engage with the application at the premium level. Unsubscribed and deleted the application on the same day‚Äîthere are better options out there."
5,Kittygaming123458,So I‚Äôve only had the app 2 days but so far I really enjoy it! The games are fun and I LOVE taking quizzes that are not advertisements. The quizzes give me actual insight about myself and I find that fascinating. I find myself getting sucked in to the information and honestly I could spend my time doing worse less productive things.
5,_mkjr,I‚Äôm really enjoying the different challenges that come up daily. I am hoping to notice a difference in my everyday life because of the games. The games peak my interest and keep me intrigued. The free version has good options so I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending to get the full package because from what I see so far it‚Äôll be worth it.
5,Liliana love,"This game is actually like a five star. Why because it actually like teaches you how to like move your brain around and like did you like lots of fun stuff and that‚Äôs what I read it a five star please. I need you to try this, so thank you I hope this is sponsored by the person that that made the swing, so yeah I hope you have an amazing day"
2,Ledogboy,"Eh, I was interested and gave it a whirl. Even at the start of a free three day trial you get pressured at every turn to subscribe for a year. Then you ‚Äúwin‚Äù a gift for completing a game- guess what? It‚Äôs a discount for a subscription! Leave that screen and try one of the tests. Finish the test and the results are blocked unless you pay for a year. Yeah decline, but wait- now it offers to sell you the results for the low, low price of $4 (or whatever it was). Basically, the thing feels like a scam, and it‚Äôs getting deleted stat."
3,JoaniePNW,I have been enjoying this app for the past few days BUT my touch is not being registered on several words (in different areas of the screen). I will highlight a word & it does not work. Then I try touching each letter & retry. Sometimes that works & sometimes the word works if highlighting the word backwards. Other times I just gave up & went to the next game. It was so bad time after time that I just quit. VERY frustrating!
1,shelbym21,"I got the free trial to start out and it states ‚Äúwill not charge until the end of the trial period‚Äù but I went to pay my credit card today and sure enough, they charged me before my trial period even ended. Not impressed with companies that say one thing and do another  The app was similar to other brain game type apps and I‚Äôm not seeing anything that warrants the subscription cost. Also, the purchase didn‚Äôt even show up in my subscriptions either so I had to go out of my way to try to work with Apple to cancel this."
4,Braydenbleak,"This game is fantastic its multiple games in one and with the quizzes section that makes it multi platform esq. I would buy the premium but the $29 a year is a little much. The developers did great on this game, people would be more inclined to pay on a one time charge of $10-$20. If you go in over-asking you‚Äôll most likely get less than you first bargained for."
5,TheCharlieVerse,I think that impulse is a great app to sharpen your mind. It even tells you when you outperform others. This app is great for remembering simple math problem and getting your memory to be photographic. Also the focus aspect of this game is just brilliant. The one with the arrows and the one with the sort the trash really makes you focus hard and what to do.
4,Swaggertyman,I was looking for an app to help with basic short term memory and after using Impulse for a week I have seen some gain in focus and remembering numbers even basic math skills has improved. The one thing I dislike is that I can‚Äôt seem to sync progress between my iPad and iPhone. I paid for the lifetime subscription and was hoping there was a way to sync them.
1,DT1256,"5 minutes into using the app and I get prompted with a prompt to review it, unskippable advertisements, and ‚Äúamazing‚Äù discounts for a paid subscription. All before I can really figure out what the app is about.   I‚Äôm deleting the app after being spammed once every hour with push notifications to use the app, that if clicked on only open more advertisements. The ‚Äúexercises‚Äù are just simple flash games, not even sure if I could cal them puzzles or anything that insinuates productivity. Why is this a highly recommended app on the App Store?"
5,david dobrik fanboi,"I used to be skeptical of apps like this that you have to pay for the subscription but it is entertaining for when you don‚Äôt want to scroll on social media, and after a few hours of getting lost in the games my brain actually felt very good"
5,Andrea ‚òª,"At first I didn‚Äôt believe in the app, but as soon as I opened it and did my first activity, I was in shock. I play this whenever I‚Äôm stressed and it works like a charm when it comes to calming one. Overall this might seem bland, but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not even describable with words! I really recommend trying it!"
5,F Manzini,It‚Äôs really easy to stick with this app so far. It helps especially when I am feeling anxious and need to focus prior to a meeting or presentation. I personally struggle with letting my nervous derail my productivity in both scenarios.  I prepare diligently and just have things apart when I‚Äôm on stage or just meeting with colleagues. It seems silly but these games really help.
5,MikeyUnknown,"As the title says , it‚Äôs a great game . The different mini games within keeps me engaged , whether it‚Äôs matching items , basic math , or following an image with a single line . there‚Äôs many ways this game improves your brain . 10/10 would recommend . kind of a steep price for a the full version ( i say as a college student ) but the daily tasks are enough !!"
5,......‚òÅ,I decided to give this a try because I have been looking for ways to help my Momz concentration & memory.  She has been suffering from memory loss for a few years now.  Now that I‚Äôve gone thru several rounds I plan on adding it to her phone & tablet.    I will post an update on how it is going with her after awhile.  *fingers crossed*.
5,DanielKearse1,This is such a great value and keeps you sharp. The games and trainings really do provide a mental workout while keeping track of your progress. A lot of games that would otherwise be riddled with ads or micro transactions are available in impulse and scale with you as you progress.
1,shanbo2,"I downloaded it because I got a ad on another app and started doing some of the ‚Äúbrain teasers‚Äù. None of them were like what I seen in the ad, I bought the premium to see if it was in there and it wasn‚Äôt. So, when I deleted it, it was still charging me. I‚Äôve read other reviews about this and y‚Äôall say the same thing to all other customers. Honestly, don‚Äôt install this garbage app, it scams you and takes money for no reason, what‚Äôs the point of making brain teasers and making people pay just to make themselves smarter. Such terrible people work at this company."
5,EmersynJ,"Impulse is the best brain training game of all time! It really makes you think, and always gives you honest results! There are tons of games and quizzes to take, and Impulse always has special games just for you! So don‚Äôt believe this nonsense about how bad it it, download it now, and see for yourself! That Impulse is definitely worth it."
4,12b1inamillion,"Impulse is one of the best brain training apps I‚Äôve ever used. It have great mind games and even tests; IQ tests, ADHD tests, etc. The only downside about this game is that it costs money, and many people would just like to have a brain training app for free but other than that, this app is amazing. There are no ads and you can see what your score is compared to others. Overall I‚Äôd rate this app 4.5 stars, it truly is great."
5,123546217,"I like the games but I can‚Äôt choose them, I have not seen the ones to draw which I think would be more of a challenge for me. Thank you for your response. Looks like I found the game after all, it does not show but you can choose it if you browse."
5,Yessssssssss&@(),"I love this app so much! It‚Äôs 100% free, unless you want to unlock extra fun games! You can take tests bout yourself. You can find a brief answer to the test but if you want to find out more about yourself you have to pay. Overall this is a great app. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone who wants to train there brain!"
5,Buck Up Louise,"Strike that, I do love my brain‚Ä¶ this game is just here to make me awesomely aware of areas of improvement, areas that have been neglected, and most certainly avoided. As my wise, energetic age 83 grandmother says: the more you do, the more you can do. If the brain is a muscle, as they say‚Ä¶ then Impulse is a mental gym membership offering guaranteed results. Here‚Äôs to still growing."
4,TheBestiesChannel,"I don‚Äôt have memory loss or anything but doing this everyday is so fun and easy! I really fell like im improving but it‚Äôs like everything you have to pay for. I‚Äôll finish a quiz or a game and I have to pay to see the results. I never liked reading and now I have to PAY to read? No, no, NOOO. It‚Äôs good and I recommend but if they really make us pay 2.00 for the app In the first place and then LET ME SEE WHAT PERSONALITY I HAVE!!!"
5,Jock Cranley,"This is simply the best Am getting better already I can‚Äôt say much but it‚Äôs as simple as it can be This is great man I‚Äôm loving it already. And the fact that they tell u the percentage at which u passed ur peers,‚Ä¶bruh for me that says ‚Äúchallenge urself to be better‚Äù man, I don‚Äôt know about the rest of y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs really good, try it out!"
5,adfallin,"I have gone to many doctors, and have had this type of training from Professionals for thousands of thousands of dollars. For the first time in my life, I can finally take control of how I am learning without the overly inflated price tag of doctors. I absolutely love this app."
4,Zaharalynn,"Great source of information about how we rate intellectually speaking in this world. Although not exact science, it gives a good sense of where we stand in regards to others. The games and quizzes are not too heavy or personally invasive, yet the outcome is quite precise. I have enjoyed every minute of finding out more about myself and feeling confident that I am intelligent."
3,Zenutopia,"I have been enjoying playing the brain games, and I feel really accomplished when I get 100%. I recently updated the app this week, and then I noticed the game ‚Äúcandy sort‚Äù is buggy. It works for the first few moves, and then I‚Äôm not able to move the candy into a new flask. The candy just pops straight up and down. It doesn‚Äôt move into a new container. Developers, can you please fix this???"
3,"Jarhkfg!gfligwru,fg""rbf,","I love this app, it has great mind training games and it keeps me off of social media. It‚Äôs the best mind training app I've seen so far, but why do have to pay to get test results. Seriously? I took 16 minutes out of my day (which doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but I could‚Äôve been doing something else) to take and IQ test that didn‚Äôt even give me the results. Very annoying, can you at least give part of the result, like just your IQ?"
5,Psychic9548602205,I‚Äôve played many brain training games in the past and this app is different from all the others every day it gives you different games to play that‚Äôs enjoyable and each different game improves something different for your brain.  Give it a try! You get a one week free trail than it‚Äôs a membership
5,ashton3310,"Most people after work or during down time watch movies/shows. I personally do it as well but have recently started to play these games. I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference I‚Äôm my short term/long term memory, focus, and ability to problem solve. This app is truly a gem!"
5,N'Awlins in SFLA,"This is only my second day. However, I can see how much I need it, because it is quite challenging. The bursts are short enough for me to not want to give up. I started with the minimum possible to not get discouraged. So far so good. Would like to comment again in another month. I almost can feel my synapses growing."
5,T√≠shaüòá,"This is the illy game that will stay on my phone and the next and the next. When I‚Äôm in the middle of a crowd I can pull out my phone and play a game. Not only does it calms my anxiety, but it strengthen me mentally. It‚Äôs a good way to challenge your skills. And most of all, it‚Äôs fun. All the things I like to do and play all in one app. I highly recommend. This game is my electronic therapy,"
5,Muffintop Mike,I am a firm supporter of an application that wants to enhance the brain . Impulse is an app that triggers our impulses and how to make better judgmental decisions through various memory game and observing patterns . I enjoy apps like Lumosity and elevate but Impulse has it beat with affordable pricing and lifetime membership opportunity. A game like this will be good for your relatives whether they are nieces or nephews or even older siblings .
5,addison{(!!!!!)}#$,It is a great game to practice memory and other skills you might not be born with. It keeps track of how many days you have been on it. It also has tests you can take to make to levels harder to do or easier. That is all I have about Impulse. Also it is a great game to play in the car or even when you are just bored.
5,Jackson-123456789,"This game is immaculately designed in so many different aspects of amazing. I‚Äôve been playing this for 2 weeks, and (as a person with ADHD) I‚Äôve already seen significant growth in my attention span, focus, memory, and problem solving. I can‚Äôt express how grateful I am for the gift of my eyes falling upon this absolute masterpiece of a mobile game. Bravo, devs."
5,CalmüòåPandaüêº10,I really don't know how to say it changed and improved my life like after a few days of using it I realized that it was great and all but I needed a therapist I still use this app and my therapist is a great support in my life and to this day after only a few months my happier then I have ever been. : )
5,Pogepi,"I tried this for two days so far, and it‚Äôs been really interesting and fun. I like the puzzles and brain training exercises because it feels like I‚Äôm practicing more mental acuity. I like that there are little quizzes that help me learn more about myself. I also like that there are no ads in the app and it allows me to play non stop if I please."
5,Pedro Da Pug,Very intriguing to problem/task solve various puzzles better than watching social media videos with negative time wasting scenarios in my opinion the mind is like the body it needs exercise and nourishment think about what you occupy your time with in a day to day scenario theirs 24 hours in a day 168 hours per week Impulse is a Mind exercise
4,Well at future,"Certain times whenever an ad shows or most times, really it like freezes and then doesn‚Äôt let me tap on anything in the ad and this doesn‚Äôt happen in any of my other apps just this one and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the app or my phone if this is a problem that could be fixed that would be lovely. thank you."
5,Bellaforta63,I have had a subscription to the game for several years now but would like to be able to reset some of the tests or have more levels added to some of my favorite games such as Robotic Flows. I see that other games get levels added on a regular basis for which I am thankful. Thanks for making this app.
5,Isaiah Perrz,"This app is so far great 2 days in, because it describes what training of the brain you want to do and helps explain it in a easy way.  Plus you can pay lifetime which not other apps do. I appreciate the fact they don‚Äôt want a money grab from subscriptions and have lifetime payment as a option."
5,Vicki . V,I loved this game it really tests your skills. This is such a fun game and you should try it I have had the best experience with this game and I‚Äôm 10 impulse wanted me to help so this is the review just download the game. There‚Äôs not a lot of ads to skip to 15 seconds and you can take test to see if you have ADHD or anxiety or stuff like that so download it.
5,MEGHANWHOOP,I find myself scrolling on social ruining my serotonin levels & creating false reality in my head lol along with the occasional self comparison lol  This is a super fun alternative & keeps the brain working in some way we might not use too much - idk would rather play a brain game than lose cells from social medias in my all free time
5,GoodGroup,"I really felt engaged in these minigames and it didn‚Äôt feel gimmicky or forced. No ads, an all around decent experience. I like that it tells you how you stack up against other users and keeps you engaged with goals as well. Wish I could facilitate buying the full version! But I can‚Äôt at the moment üò∞"
5,Pen gwynn,This is a great app that gives you the opportunity to challenge yourself and to see how well you rate with others. It also gives you the opportunity to see how well and how much you can advance in a short period of time. It‚Äôs challenging. It‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs rewarding. It‚Äôs enjoyable and just an all around good time.
5,ang65,"Variety of brain exercises that keep you interested, and are quick to do. I have been starting my day with short exercises to get my mind ready for the day. Plus there are extra ‚Äúgames‚Äù to keep your mind sharp.  I also like the tests that you first do to establish your baseline, as well as your strengths and weaknesses."
5,kiwi.chimX2,The game is easy to work with. It knows it has ads and advises you how to deal with them. The games are a very fun challenge and I hope to be able to keep on playing for long enough without having to pay. Or if I find it good enough to keep going I‚Äôll actually start paying for it.
5,SallyG97,"I play every day and I love it. It keeps me thinking and has greatly improved my abilities. I especially love the puzzles, candy sort, language games. I am working on improving my math skills. It‚Äôs worth it and I wouldn‚Äôt say that if I really didn‚Äôt feel it. The robotic flows calm me down at night. I just can‚Äôt say enough good about this app."
1,barefootbori,"Even if you get a subscription, say the base level, if you don‚Äôt buy up to the yearly you cannot access everything - but it acts like you can when you are choosing a subscription. Bait & switch vibes. Also, apps like these are not scientifically backed #1 and #2 the science actually demonstrates that these do not improve IQ, brain function, or anything else. They‚Äôre all baseless claims. Fun for gaming if that‚Äôs your thing though.  1-star due to the inability to access everything even when you are paying a subscription."
5,nanie007,The main reason why I like impulse is I get a mental break. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom of 3 which means my brain is always looking out for danger. I never have a break and although this has my attention it‚Äôs quite different. For a few minutes a day I get to just enjoy impulse. I‚Äôm testing my brain & I have fun while doing it.
5,Gr8Ape1974,"I‚Äôm on my 2nd day and really like the variety of activities, so far. Keeps my scatterbrain entertained while also challenging it. I also like how the activities start out easy and then progressively get more difficult. At least I can feel somewhat accomplished even if it is challenging at times."
5,pup fluffer,"I love this app so much because it helps me with my memory and helps make my brain so much stronger. Since I am in school, it helps me with my smartness for school. In the beginning, it asks you to select your age, which is very helpful because it knows what you need help with from there. I love this app because it is and can be very helpful for all."
3,NikiKoub,"I have become pretty hooked on the crossword game, and find the challenges and puzzles engaging and fun.  It has become very clear through the crossword game that whoever is responsible for creating the puzzles has a strong religious background, based on the word choice and the words not deemed words (as bonuses).  In this day and age I find that a bit heavy handed and would have given a higher rating were it not for that."
5,solodai76,"My memory has improved since doing daily exercises and my computations are no longer delayed !  I‚Äôve always loved challenging brain teasers but this one in particular has help me become more balanced hemisphere wise. So it‚Äôs worth the fee that you pay to play fun games. And improve concentration, memory and comprehension skills."
5,applepoepoe,Aside from being asked to pay(like all apps these days) the FREE games are dope. I did the IQ test and yes I did pay for it. I‚Äôm vain and wanted to see how smart I am. I got 132. According to the app that‚Äôs gifted. My girl got 129 lol. She got the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù title though. So though my score was higher now she can lord over me that she‚Äôs ‚Äúsuperior.‚Äù Haha I love it. Real great app. Lowkey I may pay for the sub
5,LilHohndo,When I was in school I never liked school. But I was always smart because I tried. But when I got out I stopped using my brain as much and feel like my brain sharpness started slowing down until I found this app. And feels like my brains a little quicker day by day
5,Nurse_Nae,I wasn‚Äôt too sure when I down loaded it Heather or not it would be worth my time or even worth using any of the space on my phone. Most brain training apps get deleted shortly after I get them because I lose interest but I must say I am impressed with this one.  I really enjoy the app and can‚Äôt wait to play daily.
5,London Joy!,"These challenges are fun and keep you focused, teach you how to focus, to increase your brain power.  When you think it‚Äôs easy, you trip up!  You learn about your focus ability.  Also, great games to challenge your memory skills.  Learn how to sharpen your skills in what you see in an instant, and then recall. Love this brain power strengthening app."
5,FitBodyofChrist,"As someone who trains their physical health all the time and teaches us for a living health and wellness, I thought I would try this app for myself to see if it helped with mental exercise exercises. I‚Äôm only two days into the program but so far I‚Äôm enjoying it greatly and if the progress continues at this rate, I will be referring this app to all of my clients."
1,finepokwsop,Don‚Äôt waste your time if you are looking to play this game for free. They will lock your interests and continue to ask you to subscribe while hiding the close but so that it almost seems like there is no other choice. There are also frequent ads. These are people that understand how the brain works and they are trying to use that information against you to influence you to pay for something you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. I would never consider the paid version if this is how they treat their free users.
5,Gbhs2017,Normally when I‚Äôm bored I just scroll for hours on instagram or tik tok. Now I can do something that engages my mind. I‚Äôm not always in the mood to pick up a book or go on a walk. So this is a good way to fiddle around productively. I got the lifetime membership which wasn‚Äôt unreasonable at all.
4,WickedBuzzkill,For the most part it‚Äôs a good app.  I wish I could adjust the daily training to increase the number of activities.  Also the candy sort is a bit buggy.  It doesn‚Äôt mark some of the puzzles as complete even though I have completed multiple times.  Also it sometimes repeats the same puzzle over and over again.
2,Brayden70,This app would be a 5 out of 5 almost perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the stupid weekly payments. Why do you expect me to pay 7 dollars a week or 50 a year just to look at some results you guys probably have AI generated anyway? I also saw a response where they said payment isn‚Äôt required but after taking an iq test and an adhd test I can‚Äôt look at my results without paying. Ridiculous. And people wonder why no one gets help. Always gotta pay absurd amounts for basic.
4,Annette_B24,"I enjoy the challenging yet fun activities that both keep my brain engaged and provide a little fun! Also, I like the various personality/psychology tests provided. However, I would prefer a few redo options for some of the daily games, if I made a mistake and/or I wanted to play again for fun. Also, the candy sorting game has a few bugs that need to be sorted."
5,Truthfully üëç,"I have been having trouble with all kinds of things lately and I have been trying to find an app that works, finch is ok but you don‚Äôt really have to the things to help yourself out, but impulse makes it nice and it‚Äôs easy to figure out I recommend for everyone reading this"
5,Dylan..B,"I downloaded the app hoping to not spend a penny, I chose the three day free trial and I was planning on canceling by the third day but after I did the first game it gave me a massive deal on the year-long subscription that I couldn‚Äôt pass up. There‚Äôs so much to do on the app and it really does help increase memory mental math and so much more!!!"
5,thummyxoxo,The free version is great too but if you get annoyed with ads i‚Äôd take advantage of the subscription deals they have (which is a lot). It‚Äôs worth it and I definitely feel my brain being worked. It has daily challenges to do and fun games to keep your brain going. I recommend
5,bernicenata,"I personally don't like playing games. I'd get bored after I play twice, but people say I need to play to train my brain in order to minimize the risk of dementia (I'm still 22) but this game is really a game changer! Definitely increased my alertness, and gosh my brain do feel like it was having a workout sesh!"
1,SoulSteeper101,"The sub cost more a month than your Netflix. You can take some of the tests on the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù but to see results you must subscribe. So is it really a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù or is it a 3 day see what we can do for $20+ a month. Free trials usually let you have full access, considering they charge you if you try it and forget to cancel it. Dishonest imo, I might have subbed if it was a full access free trial, but it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a solid business plan to cash in on ppl, but I usually lean towards rewarding good customers not companies looking for a quick buck from passerby‚Äôs"
4,oregonwolf,"I feel like they need to add more games. And have better tracking of your scores. Also on the word guess game, give us some other options besides 5 letter words. Also, I can‚Äôt follow directions because it said to leave a 5 star review with a detailed comment to see what they could fix but if I leave a 5 star review, where‚Äôs the room for improvement?"
1,Rye1016,"The app in itself is entertaining, but I initially bought it based on an AD from impulse Indicating that they have certain personality and character tests that they do not have! Like I said, the puzzles and games are entertaining but I got the app for the personality tests and they are severely lacking. Stop advertising tests that the app doesn‚Äôt offer. Wish I could get a refund!! The developer responded insinuating that I was on the demo/free plan, that is not the case! I paid for the full year, like I said FALSE advertising!!! It doesn‚Äôt offer everything that they advertise"
5,jamie rush,"I‚Äôm 45 and I felt like my brain was going away and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was scared that I was aging and my brain was not aging well. I started using this app and so far it‚Äôs helping me tremendously. I‚Äôm still new with it, so we‚Äôll see where we are in a few months from now, but I am hopeful and optimistic that it will help my brain tremendously."
4,Plumberxyourmum_fandom,"I love that it intellectually stimulates my brain, but this app is very similar to other apps. ‚ÄòImpulse‚Äô tells me that my intelligence quotient is at 139. I know my brain isn‚Äôt at that quotient, and I dislike when tests overestimate my score to give me a higher self-esteem. I‚Äôm using my score to help me improve, not to have my confidence improve. I don‚Äôt want my brain to get overwhelmed by an unrealistic standard."
5,Limanball,"And this app will help you do that. 10-20 or even 30 minutes a day will be great to get your brain in the right mode. And most of the people are spending hours on their phones daily, so why not do something useful for yourself. Instead of scrolling down the TikTok, Instagram or any other feed."
5,whos.emeraldz,"Impulse is great because they give you new challenges everyday to train your mind, they also have different varieties of games to choose from. They have tests to see if you have ADHD, and others, they can also quiz your IQ, and determine your IQ class, so overall, this app is great to use when you want to train your mind."
5,#gamer.com,It‚Äôs so fun and it honesty makes me feel smarter. i love how it gives me feedback after every game on how i did and personalizes that game for me so i can improve! i don‚Äôt pay for the subscription and honestly you don‚Äôt need to it‚Äôs an amazing game as it is and there are barely any ads(please don‚Äôt change that). highly recommend!
5,FlailingMo,This app really does give your brain a workout and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. I also like the different test that you can take that analyze how your mind works. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you only want to kill some time or really get into doing some serious mental training it‚Äôs worth checking this app out. It‚Äôs worth it.
1,Cdubravcic,"They alluded to an easy to access free quiz with the ad on Instagram I clicked on to find out what kind of adhd you have (only after installing an app which the ad didn‚Äôt make clear), navigating a bunch of subscribe now malarkey, and then answering multiple questions in the actual quiz , it still didn‚Äôt give me results on the type of adhd I have without paying up for either a subscription or a one time report fee. I don‚Äôt like it when apps aren‚Äôt up front about this kind of thing. You need to rethink your ad strategy."
5,Joedeertae1,Don‚Äôt play this game before bed. You won‚Äôt be able to go to sleep. Brain goes into  overdrive .  Excellent workout. Love it! A must download. Technology has put us in a drone state of mind . This is a great app to keep your brains motor functions hitting on all cylinders. Google is not going answer or to do this for you!! Put in the work and keep your mind sharp.
5,Savannah&Karol,"I absolutely love this app for brain training, although you can‚Äôt fully get everything unless you pay, there is still plenty that is free. Currently I am doing the seven day training plan I like it a lot but I always have to start at a kindergarten level and that‚Äôs kind of annoying. In all I would say this is a great app!‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,NMC :(,I‚Äôm not a sudoku person. I don‚Äôt like Wordle. They‚Äôre not for me. These games are very and presentation in difficulty in every way that they can be. You‚Äôre not playing the same game over and over and over. It‚Äôs been pretty challenging. I think these sorts of things are super important to keep your brain and nervous system engaged as you get older. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Give it a try.
5,CHICAGOgang,"Tell me something that is wrong with these games. They did an great job developing this app and I just downloaded it. Overtime I might get tired of these games, but I know I‚Äôm gonna be playing them for a while until then, especially since I bought the full version. I want a sharp brain and if you do too, use this app!"
5,AveryBellaL,It may be hard but it has been really fun to play! It starts off sometimes easy and gets hard it allows your brain to think and move quickly! You can also play daily games and then after play more games after that! It‚Äôs very fun and I think y‚Äôall who haven‚Äôt played it should play!
5,Ktaytx,"I am enjoying the free trial. Considering paying the $25 to unlock all features. That‚Äôs a reasonable price and I do feel like my cognitive abilities have gotten sharper with use. Would recommend to anyone, especially for older folks, brain games like these are good to decrease the risk of dementia."
1,_SMG_,"You RARELY ever play a game here. It‚Äôs literally ad after ad after ad after ad after ad, 30 second game, ad, ad, ad, ad and another ad. What‚Äôs worse is the ads are all at least 30 seconds, some a minute, and when they finish they wait another 20 seconds or so before you even can click the X to exit the ad and bring up the next ad. Then some other ads don‚Äôt even have an X show up, they force you to click on it in order to get to the next screen. This is just an advertising app, nothing good."
5,traveling memaw,"I stumbled upon this during a fit of boredom, I remembered seeing it before and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I am very impressed with and impressed with myself for doing well on the challenges. As we age games like these help us keep our brains in good shape. I‚Äôm not a doctor but I am aging so this will definitely help keep the cobwebs away"
5,Lizzy_bizzy69,"I think impulse is a great game honestly! It has a variety of games you can play and even things to challenge your skills and also to relax you. I always get bored playing one game, and it‚Äôs so great that it offers many choices of games. The best thing abt it tho is it‚Äôs free and you don‚Äôt have to have internet to play it!"
5,guest1123,It feels more like a reward playing the games when simultaneously it is a productive exercise. It helps to realize the effect of focussing on one thing at a time to achieve the perfect score. It is only when the mind wonders than something is missed.
5,Okie in Oakhurst!,I can see this benefiting younger people too as this sharpens memory and makes it fun while ‚Äúplaying!‚Äù We all can benefit from brain exercises‚Äî-not just for the aged.  I‚Äôve gone from a 4/5 to a 5/5 (yay!) on cognitive testing. I will continue to use this app as long as it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs helped so much and I appreciate it being accessible to me.
5,LadyDi1369-69,"I really like playing this game because it training your mind to do different kinds of games to help with your focus, speed, concentration and lots of different things. If you want to help yourself to better focus, concentrate & remember this is a awesome game to play. Try downloading it and give it a try let‚Äôs see how you do."
5,Tm2danc,I never buy games but I decided to on this one because I wanted to improve my brain power in a number of areas.  Attention span most importantly but so many other areas too.  I love the games and I sometimes play for hours at night on the challenging puzzles. Definitely work my one time purchase!
5,Kk fun brain games,This app is really fun and also helps to strengthen your brain. We should always challenge our brain health and these games do just that. It also can keep you become accountable each day and although it‚Äôs a game its also a fun way to break away from the mundane of everyday.
5,Gabyyyy :)),"This is fabulous! When I first downloaded this, I didn‚Äôt see how this could help me improve my memory, but having this app for a few months now, I see a difference. I have a way better time remembering things. To whomever created this app, a big shoutout!! I will definitely recommend this to my friends :))))"
4,JRCGENX,"Overall solid program. A few idiosyncrasies with the idioms. Phrases said in one part of the world might be slightly different other places and the configuration doesn‚Äôt take that into consideration. For example. ‚ÄúPut in ones two cents‚Äù & ‚ÄúPut ones two cents in‚Äù are similar and both appropriate, however the game states one is incorrect."
5,Sobo1084,"I have a lot of members in my family losing their memory as they age , i notice a lot of me in them so I‚Äôm trying to break the cycle. This makes it fun and makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing something  productive.   Also all the test options are really helpful for self care and working on self in general."
4,mcholtzclaw,"I just started but it‚Äôs good to test your brain to stay sharp. With mental illness on the rise and the feelings of inadequacy many Americans suffer from these days, I feel that this is helpful. Just wish it was free. Good on the creators for providing good content for people to subscribe to. Can‚Äôt blame them because we live in a free market where you have to make money to thrive."
5,Osbornjl71,"I needed something not too hard or time consuming to keep my abilities sharp and this app really fits the bill. The games are quick, not frustrating by being too hard or too easy and you can squeeze in a little exercise while waiting in line, etc."
1,G a l a x y 123,"I purchased the lifetime access in early June 2023 and this app is still charging me weekly. When I try to submit for a refund the site (Apple?) will only let me go back as far as last month to submit a request for refunds. The charges I was able to submit for are still pending, but there is no way to contact Impulse to get the other charges that they purposely did AFTER my lifetime charge on Jun 3, 2023. Can someone at Impulse reach out to me to make this right? This is ridiculous and feels like a scam!"
5,cassette1234,"It can be hard to find a game suitable for OCD, ADHD, and autism. This game showcases the different impulses the brain desires. Usually I have to have music, a show, or a movie in the background, and i go from tik tok to instagram to one of my many app games and none of them suit my needs. But this way I can have everything and just switch within the game!!! 10/10"
1,Gonezpini,"I dos not even accept the free trial and the game opened when I tried to exit the plan options page. It tells I have a free trial that must be cancelled before it expires but it does not tell me when it expires. I have tried to cancel the free-trial /subscription in all possible ways but it doesn‚Äôt let me. It tells me to contact support but there is no phone number/ email or anything on the app or online. I better not be charged!  Update: WHY ISN‚ÄôT APPLE TAKING HANDS ON THIS MATTER?  GMRD the developer of this app never responds to emails but gladly continues to charge, their website has a support contact box but when you hit send a small box with an OK shows up‚Ä¶ without sending the message.  There are hundreds of dialogs with apple support of people asking how to cancel this and Apple‚Äôs response is useless.  Apple App Store is allowing scammers to take Apple users money."
5,BradWilliamsJ,"This is one of the best most competitive, brain improvement, challenges I‚Äôve seen and I love the ability to compete against others and see where you stand against other people in the same age brackets. There are many IQ tests and other cognitive testing that is totally worth the money! Keep it up!"
2,Not for anxious minds,Anytime you make a game that puts you against a clock ‚Ä¶.for most folks causes an increased stress response. I‚Äôm not paying for something that left me worse off than when I started. Then your test results are shown against the same population of people and it shows you where you rank. Sometimes you‚Äôre 98% better than those of the same age group - sometimes only 8%. So now you feel anxious and stupid. Lol no thanks - I can go to work and get laid for that!
5,Btomkiw,"I am someone who loves a good puzzle game. And as a woman approaching my 60th birthday, I want to do everything possible to remain vital for the long haul. The puzzles in Impulse are both fun and increasing challenging. And the brain boost that comes from the various games is more than worth five minutes a day. This is now part of my every day workout routine."
4,twilighto9,"I am recovering from a stroke. This app has tests that help my memory, math and peripheral short comings. All of them are hard for me but I see improvement happening. The other thing I noticed is that I do better in areas that I think are impossible to do. It helps me realize I am doing better then I think and it helps me have more grace for myself and hope"
5,Kynzie pronounced; kense,"I am loving impulse so far! (Even since I have only had it for 2 days.) I have LOVED the games! But the only thing I would change is making all of the games free to play. Sure the free ones are good, but there are still a TON of games you have to subscribe for. But still, that‚Äôs the only thing I would change. Other than that it‚Äôs AMAZING!!"
5,imasilhouette121,"I can feel my brain expanding as each day passes. Memories and skills that had been locked within my dormant mind now come to light. I am more powerful than I‚Äôve ever been and it‚Äôs only been 2 days! Soon I shall have the mental fortitude to escape to the immaterial plane. Until that day, this app will prove most useful."
5,xX≈†L√ÅY√äRXx,"This is the best brain game I have ever played it has actually helped and I haven‚Äôt even noticed till somebody had mentioned it to me. I think it is a great way to train your brain and to focus more on the unthinkable. Like people are always on there phone no one ever reads anymore, well I think an hour of this game and you should be good!"
4,Gogodap,I had previously written a 1 star review bc of the difficulty in reaching customer service. I‚Äôm happy to report that customer service did finally reach out and worked diligently to resolve my issue. I really enjoy the games and appreciate learning how to reach customer service. Still a little salty about the initial issues which were very time consuming to resolve.
5,nice momentskv,"I found this app on TikTok and it has really helped me calming my anxiety, stress and depression about hitting targeted tasks benchmarks because I used have a tbi and this has become the Nuerogym I need to feel more at ease about my mental agility. Thank you to the creator(s) of impulse for creating a gym of this sort for people that want to work on their mental health and agility!"
1,Cl1210,"I signed up for the free trial to test out the app. This did open quite a range of things for me to try out - it‚Äôs quite enjoyable. Among them, an IQ test. This was a 60 question/ 20 min test and, at the end, it gave a score.  I could see the score but would only allow me to access the report if I signed up for an ongoing membership. This immediately turned me off.  What is the purpose of a free trial if I cannot access portions of the app? What else would I have to pay extra for even if I signed up for an ongoing subscription? Immediately canceled my free trial."
5,Not-so-dumb,"Just got started, 2nd day. But I‚Äôve taking some interesting tests about myself. Personality, IQ, signs of ADHD. All adding up. And I know these brain tests will help my aging brain stay sharper. There‚Äôs a plethora of categories and another plethora of games in each. Levels ramp up difficulty well. I believe I will use this app for a long time, if not forever, to help."
5,Katiebobatie original,As ive gotten older and been glued to my phone more and more i have felt a lot dumber. This game is helping me use my brain in a more productive way and I like that :) the games are simple yet efficient and the personal quizzes have shown me a lot about myself I would‚Äôve never thought before. Overall love the app!
2,Beaniejeanie33,I am disappointed in the free version. It makes it out like you will have all this brain training. I get three games a day and they aren‚Äôt that hard. I finish in very little time and don‚Äôt feel like it takes up my time or really has much to offer. The games are sometimes challenging but you only have a few questions and it‚Äôs over. Then there is a stupid candy game that‚Äôs supposed to be relaxing but it never changes. So it‚Äôs a pointless app
3,Bagelbit,"This game is genuinely good for people who suffer from mathematical problems and those with visual spatial problems (both apply to me), however the most glaring issue I had were the constant bombardment of ads every single level. I know you‚Äôre trying to push a subscription service, but you‚Äôre not helping your case with the ads, it made me delete the app. Great game, but I just can‚Äôt deal with it."
5,RandalJohnson607,"It‚Äôs been helping increase my memory and focus! I see a big difference and it helps me unwind with the games! Definitely worth trying! I noticed a difference in memory, focus and decision making in a few weeks! It measures your progress so you know how far you‚Äôve come and what to work on!"
5,Zzekyy,It tells you what you are strong at and tells you your weaknesses. Weaknesses not to feel bad but to target as something to work on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Which by the way this app can support in growth of those weakness. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this exactly but I‚Äôm glad I subscribed to Impulse. Give it a shot!
5,DerickStaciTaylor,"As a person who struggles with anxiety, ADHD, and mediumship (Yup, I‚Äôm one of those people who the deceased talk to/through) ‚Äî this app has helped with attention and awareness.   I‚Äôm able to focus and the exercise it provides helps me with daily tasks that are usually more difficult to accomplish.   My memory has improved immensely since I began my training with this app.  If anything, I suggest going pro with the annual plan.   As the levels increase, some are blocked without it!  Overall, I‚Äôve suggested it to numerous people in my family and friends.   They tried it and some have even kept the app.  Thank you!"
2,koalacarrie,"This brain training app is so far inferior, especially compared to other apps, like Elevate. This app, Impulse, presents the exact same tests over and over again, day after day. I am sorry that I subscribed. Canceled after less than a week when I realized how simplistic and boring it is. It‚Äôs extremely monosyllabic, with very little graphic content, and FAR from what I would describe as engaging (or helpful, beyond the first day of use). I definitely do not recommend."
5,DoubleBluff007,"I often feel like I am not challenging my mind and exploring my weaknesses. Impulse offers me many ways to do both. I‚Äôve since learned more about how my mind works, what I‚Äôm good at and what I‚Äôm not.  I hope to use Impulse to improve my skills at work and to help me introspect on my emotional weaknesses to improve relationships."
5,Moni753,It‚Äôs great for testing you brains ability to process and remember information. We tend to go to the gym or walk and run to keep our body in shape why shouldn‚Äôt we do the same for our mind/brain. I like the games and information and the fact it can help with anxiety as well is a big plus for me!!
1,DSpring25,"After completing one of the personality tests online to determine my archetype, and after enabling the free trial which is the weekly fee, it did not allow me to see the results. It led me to believe it would not ask me to purchase the yearly plan in order to see my results. Also, the variations of these tests are two answer questions with very little variety or thought whatsoever. It uses methods pertaining back to Carl Jung but it does so very cheaply and with no deeper thought. Nothing sets the app apart from a free online quiz center. Extremely overpriced and underwhelming."
1,Dirt_boy,"Games are fun and challenging, but when it comes how you compare to others in your age group, it laughably bad. You‚Äôre either better than 99% of your peers or zero percent. Today I got one wrong at a higher level and it said I was better than zero percent while yesterday I was perfect in the same game and I was better than 99%. Needs work. Also, figuring out how to cancel or modify your subscription is so difficult it is bordering on fraud. There are a lot better games out there for same amount of money. Choose wisely"
5,Michi89410,"I usually don‚Äôt buy into these type of apps as they don‚Äôt usually help with my severe adhd, but I decided to give this one a try as it looked pretty interesting. The games are perfect and are actually fun and addicting. There are also some tests/quizzes which are also really fun. Definitely worth it to try this app out."
5,VRamzguy,"I feel as though the app knows me by now. Like, when slack off a few days, then I get a notification on some exercises I just ‚Äúknow‚Äù I‚Äôm going to pass with flying colors. I pass‚Ä¶ then I miss that one,but the interesting challenges and smooth transitions of the lesson/session itself makes this app that much more fun to interact with!! I love it!"
5,BuzzmanKB,There are numerous brain building apps out there. I have played a few of them. This one is both similar and different. The aesthetics are very pleasing. The exercises are not entirely new. Even with the subscription model with zero ads or just free with the ads it runs smoothly. It is not pushy and feels welcoming. Absolutely worth your time.
4,TravviusPattius,This app is insane so far and I am using it every day to keep my brain sharp in several areas. It could have some more games and it would be cool if they added meditative and mindfulness based games as well. There are other parts to the brain that aren‚Äôt enhanced on this app but I‚Äôm sure with time they will work on them. Absolutely suggest just buying the lifetime deal.
5,LexMacayla09,"Impulse has so many activities that make you actually use your brain. I recommend for when your bored, not bored, wanting a challenge, wanting an easy but fun game, etc. There are multiple games in this app and you will be excited to get back to this app every time you get off of it."
5,Lilahdream,"I really love playing Impulse because it helps me understand that I am smarter than I thought. I can see as I‚Äôm go through more levels I‚Äôm training my brain to be successful I‚Äôm only in fifth grade practicing on 13-17,I am actually a straight A Student and I am ready to go. But one thing I would like to change about impulse is the age performance üòÅüòÅ"
5,MattNKara516,"After several rounds it becomes more and more difficult. The challenges are different therefore ultimately fun. Keeps you on your toes and you definitely have to think from time to time. I have not played enough to notice a difference, however I can already tell the game is helpful."
5,david money,"I know most people don‚Äôt look at the reviews, and if they do they don‚Äôt believe their real people. Well I actually like impulse. I use it every other day. It helps my brain stay sharp. Also things most people don‚Äôt do is write reviews, well that just goes to  on show how good the app is, if I‚Äôm writing a review about it."
5,Okkk.,I had this app I think about a week now and only used it twice but I think it will be beneficial for your brain if you use it everyday so far I did math memory and attention span only in 10 mins and doing that everyday we help your brain function better I think.
5,LukasJess,This has helped me improve my overall mental health. It helps tremendously with stress and anxiety. It does more than you realize when you stay persistent. I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself from taking the tests. I like the daily motivation notifications. It keeps me going. I‚Äôm so grateful to have learned about this app!!!
1,Michael8991234579476527767,"The games were kinda fun, but I only got it for the brain teasers which don‚Äôt even let you answer the question on your own; they just make you stare at it and then when you think you know the answer you press ‚Äúshow answer‚Äù and it just tells you. I gave it 1 star because I did not know it was going to cost money until I noticed a charge from my pay pal. Apparently it went ahead and charged me for a subscription that I did not at all sign up for. Luckily it was only $7 but still I think it‚Äôs incredibly shady that they charged me without my knowledge."
5,lo_real,This app is bomb for me bc it had the test thing to gauge your type of adhd and then weird enough has a lot of games that I normally download on my phone anyway lol‚Ä¶only had it for the past 2-3 days but off to a good start of keeping it lol (laughing bc I def get bored easy and the games  are a nice rotation to my other ones too)
3,NikSeal,I‚Äôm starting this app as of two days now and I‚Äôm doing this for self awareness and everything I need to alter for the better to improve my life in all aspects. So I hope it can help with things I have failed to remember or things I overlook and change my way of thinking. Due to the ways of being raised or not raised at all. So I can be a  more positive and healed spirit and help others with their own healing and self discovery!
3,Ms. Review!,I really love this game it is so relaxing and calming to just sit and play only there are to many ads I‚Äôll try to switch my game and it just is ads ads ads it is so annoying and the fact I can‚Äôt play the full mode of the game because it is asking for money and if I don‚Äôt want to pay then I miss out on half of the game or more it‚Äôs a great game but that should be fixed other wise it is a awesome game üôÉ
5,Lena311,"I was telling my friend how I feel like I‚Äôm not remembering things as well as u used to. She mentioned to me about Impulse and how it would stimulate and keep my mind going. I absolutely love the app. I feel that with time, it will significantly improve my memory and cognitive function.  I love it so much that I have a lifetime subscription.  Thank you"
2,Flagatgirl,Like the games but they only have a limited amount you can play of each one once you have played them no more load up even though they say wait for more. I like certain games not all of them I‚Äôm paying for the app why are we limited to a certain amount of games then your done. Won‚Äôt be paying for a renewal on the app to finish games and not be able to play them for the rest of the year.
5,Hormonal1,I love these short exercises and they are a great way when you are trying to take a social media break to fill those moments when you feel like you just need to grab your phone and do something. There is always something interesting to do or learn on Impulse.
2,Sponge bob!!!,"So you‚Äôre going to advertise the app on instagram without saying anything about the price. I go on and start my free trial, take a test, and then you make me pay for subscription to see the results. Please. Its the fact that you make your customers go through this process just for me to immediately cancel my subscription due to take of transparency.    It‚Äôs fine if you want to charge. Totally understand but be upfront about it."
5,Ssmith9994,I have had the worst brain fog since getting covid a year ago. This game was recommended to me by my doctor who said I need to keep my brain thinking and problem solving to get myself back to normal. I would tell everyone to buy this app and play few minutes each day to help restore cognitive thinking
5,Good to train your kids,I love how it helps you train and during the summer you can do this it has math. It can tell you how you can use math that shows you how to play the game first before you start it and you can pick how much days you train and how much days you get off. I just love it. I recommend it for your kids.
5,Anonymousüß†,It‚Äôs fun to play when I need a little refresh or when I am being bored at waiting for the bus. It‚Äôs a little too much ads but I think it‚Äôs fair when you don‚Äôt pay for it. Besides they help you analyze your brain functions in many ways through the fun mini games.
5,TheoneandonlyChris69,"Impulse Brain Training is a game-changer! The app's intuitive interface and diverse exercises keep me engaged and challenged. Its personalized approach targets my strengths and weaknesses, while progress tracking motivates me to excel. This app is a must-have for anyone serious about enhancing cognitive function. Five stars‚ÄîImpulse Brain Training exceeds expectations!"
4,SteveTy166,Downloaded this app to try it out.  It‚Äôs cool but it started looking like too many ways to get money from me so I decided to delete it an hour after I got it.  Problem is I‚Äôm not seeing it anywhere in my subscriptions‚Ä¶.  I just want to delete this app before the first payment.  It‚Äôs an ok app just not for me.
4,Mommof3+,"It seems like some of the games would be easy, thinking back to elementary math, but they‚Äôll sneak up on you. I am no brain scientist but it feels like something is going on inside the cobwebs of my brain. I did not think I had too many of those but it seems it‚Äôs finding them. The only thing I would say is there does seem to be a bit of an agenda going on."
2,Steph_329,"While this app is entertaining (and personally nice to have and play on an airplane), it is not where the ads on Instagram say it is. I was advertised as an app to help you dive into things like adhd and trauma and I was immediately disappointed to find it was minimally addressing those things. They advertised quizzes that were game based, and I have yet to find any. There are also a lot less quizzes than expected, overall. Save your money. Do not get the subscription."
5,Fhs8,I was nervous at first as I didn‚Äôt even want to admit that I was losing memory and words were not coming to me as easily as they had previously. I found it easy to use. Not intimidating and the tests were just a bonus. Super fun with convenience of course 10 minutes a day!
5,limitlessthoughts,"This app is more then I expected because I have downloaded many different brain apps, and this one actually stimulates your brain and has fun activities. It also allows if you can‚Äôt afford it to start off with a free version to experience it. Thank App Development Team üôè"
5,I'm obsessed,"I‚Äôve never been one for phone games, but this truly takes the cake. I feel like it‚Äôs a nice distraction for my anxious/chaotic thoughts when I need something calming to focus on, and helps me become more mentally in-tune in the long run. I can see this being a part of my daily routine for many years to come."
5,Kshrouer,This game is fun if you are highly anxious like me. Just a couple minutes of playing some mind challenging games takes my mind off of all the tasks I need to accomplish in a day.. helps me to reset and refocus and be more productive ‚Ä¶ if you like quick brain challenges this is for you
5,BeGeebers,"I am going to turn 71 in a few days and am beginning to lose track of my memory due only to old age and lack of stimulus from being almost all alone in a strange city. I‚Äôve not been able to meet people and to make friends. I don‚Äôt watch tv, preferring to read instead."
1,TryAnotherNickName756,"If this is brain training then so is candy crush. Slapping the title brain training on some games a child could play and telling your audience that they are ""better than 90% of their piers!"" is genius. 30 question IQ test, 25 question AHDH diagnosis. Yeah right. If this is what you settle for, then the TV remote and microwave buttons are also brain training for numbers and calculation. Maybe social media scroll is brain training. I'm doing spelling training typing a review. If only I could watch some ads or pay money to have someone pat me on the back for it."
5,Tkpro13tom,Impulse is a fun game to sharpen your skills in various ways. Quick bath and identification scenarios will assist you to be more observant and problem solve. Mistakes are accounted for so you don‚Äôt get off easy. The app provides a useful way to spend time when you aren‚Äôt doing anything else. You will make time to play the games.
5,ellolowoman,"I downloaded impulse because I wanted a game that would exercise my mind, and evaluate my thinking and this app does exactly that. Impulse has fun games and great quick feedback. I love the simple design and the variety. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to do pointless activities and enjoys puzzles!"
1,Boredouttamyflippingmind,"They trap you by making you sign up for their ‚Äúfree‚Äù 3 day trial. Then it automatically charges you if you do not cancel it. However there is no quick and painless way to cancel the subscription at this time. You have to jump through hoops and give your left Thumb to even figure how to begin to cancel it. NOT an Honest App. I‚Äôd rather have a true free trial and then if I like it hit a button to keep it. Beware of apps like this, they are banking on you forgetting or getting frustrated and just paying for it."
1,Jayziggy25,The app is great but the process to end your subscription is terrible. Since I did not subscribe through the App Store you have to search for a way to unsubscribe and then it doesn‚Äôt even work. I tried to unsubscribe before my 7 day free trial was up and I didn‚Äôt hear anything from the company. I tried to contact them at least 2 different ways and still nothing and I still ended up being charged the the subscription that I was trying to cancel before I was supposed to be charged.
5,Lulapandora,I am always wanting to challenge my brain especially not working a day job! It‚Äôs great to keep my brain sharp! But I like how it tells me how I match up to my peers! It‚Äôs a good guideline on how much I can improve or to impress myself on how good i‚Äôm doing! I know people always say never compare yourself but I think they do it in a gentle way!
4,Dooted‚ÄônZooted,"So far, it‚Äôs a good app. I‚Äôm only on the second day of training, but the games are easy to stay focused on and help me feel like I‚Äôm making progress. Not that I‚Äôm clinically recommending it, but it does seem to help me focus more as someone diagnosed with ADHD. Might not help all cases of it, but it is right now. I‚Äôd recommend doing the trial first then deciding to if you want to pay for it before committing of course."
5,‚ù§ C h e r r y ‚ù§,"Very convenient app to use when on the go. I use it on the commute to/from work or when I‚Äôm standing in line for something, and I must say I feel much more motivated when I see that my score has improved in a specific cognitive area. Looking forward to future updates of the app!"
5,1banaltra,Finally a game app that is what it claims. I‚Äôve enjoyed the simple games as they increase with challenges. I find myself getting back to this app when I‚Äôm in a waiting room or such places like the car service department to help stay awake üòâ.  I‚Äôm older so I think this helps with speed/timing.
5,dreadpurse,"I appreciate the app trying to accommodate each user and I really like that the app gives them challenges they can handle!   Honestly, I‚Äôm not a fan of math‚Äî honestly if there‚Äôs a way to exercise the brain without using math then I‚Äôd be happier for it, haha.   but I do like that the app teaches the users about the human brain. It‚Äôs very helpful!"
5,beno√Æt the brotagonist,"I seldom write reviews, but this app is beyond fantastic. As someone who is sick of perpetual subscription models, I love the fact that you can make a one-time purchase. $50 seemed steep at first - but the games, puzzles, and quizzes are seemingly endless. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be more proactive with their screen time, rather than endlessly doom scrolling. üôèüèº"
5,IssaNessa,This game is completely different from all the other apps I used. It‚Äôs got my full attention when playing and honestly look forward to playing. I believe this will help give my brain the extra boost it needs and definitely will be adding the app to the kids phone.
5,B1rdTheW0rd,I‚Äôve only been playing it for a few days but I love it. It‚Äôs way more affordable than other brain training apps that I‚Äôve tried and the games are great. It feels much more organized and I enjoy the games a lot more than Elevate for example. I have a feeling I‚Äôll be able to stick to this more easily.
5,Yeehawsome!!,"The app is so well curated that I find myself drifting throughout the day for the positive reinforcement that comes with mental exercise.  The IQ test made me consider that I‚Äôm capable of more than I had initially believed.  The games are fun, the content is great and I love this app. I‚Äôm certainly a raving fan here and have told a few people about it already"
5,Me$$ala,"I saw this app in an ad one day and didn‚Äôt think anything of it but i actually downloaded it, and that‚Äôs when i started trying out the daily tasks. Doing the daily tasks are super fun and innovative and my brain thoroughly enjoys the time i‚Äôve spent since i‚Äôve gotten accustomed to using and understanding this cool app. üòÅ"
2,Junior BRPO,"Chame on you stealing from everyone knowing that after delete this app you will still charge people,apple should and will be hold accountable for allowing you developers to steal money from apple clients,$2.99 to stop all ads and everyone get the ads in each new level hahaha good one I‚Äôm a lawyer and will confront apple and developers regarding this in legal action, yes I read all your disclaimers and fine print, I know what I find out and will use it again you and apple App Store."
5,Gabby Rohr,I have been struggling with my school life. It has always been hard to focus or to remember something small‚Ä¶ But impulse is helping me to keep track and to get my mind stronger!!! One of the most helpful apps on my phone. So if you are having the same problems as me then I recommend you get this.
1,wishfulphoenix123,Updated- I received an email from the developer saying family share isn‚Äôt available. So be careful not to drop $40 on an app you can‚Äôt share w your family bc you can‚Äôt get a refund and it states NO where in the information that it can‚Äôt be shared!!   Hi! I love this app and my daughter has started playing it too. I purchased the pro version but it won‚Äôt show in family share for her to download the full version. I only spent so much bc I thought we would be able to share it. Please help.
5,doesn'tmatterwhatisay,It‚Äôs still the beginning phase of me using the app but immediately I‚Äôm engaged and excited to do more activities. There is only so much time in the day and something that takes the time you want it to is perfect and you can always increase or decrease to fit your time and lifestyle
5,Nachoforlife,I thoroughly enjoy the game it makes me think a lot more than what I normally have to in helps me process a lot of what I do now because I gave makes you think so much which is what you want and that‚Äôs why I really like this game because that‚Äôs what I was looking for something a challenge me in this game really challenges you.
5,GiselQuevdo,"I actually love training my brain I have many games so far and this one actually motivates me to keep going because I don‚Äôt want to lose my streak. It‚Äôs really simple and very fun to do! It shows how to do the games first and then let‚Äôs you improve. I realllyyy like to keep my brain going, so if you‚Äôre like me this is the game for you!!"
5,Capinij,I love to learn and the only thing that helped was watching repeat Jeopardy shows. This app is insane and I‚Äôm addicted. I can‚Äôt stop playing! My memory has improved and my thinking has improved. Thank you for developing this app its a lot better than the Mensa app I purchased 8 years ago.
5,Jaggeeda,This is really what I needed because of my brain injury and trying to get my wits back about myself all over again which is a journey in itself believe me this is a real deal testimony truly and honestly speaking from a sunken place mentally fighting all kind of obstacles to get my mental stability back is definitely a REAL WAR IN ITSELF FOR REAL TRUST ME ü§¶üèæüò§üôèüèøü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,Fantasylover,"If you want the commercial free version of this game it will cost you well more than twice as much as Netflix every month. Ridiculous and stupid. If you go for the free version, be prepared to be bombarded by ads between every game. The commercials last longer than the actual game play. The ads are for gambling games. This game is merely a come-on to sell you into the losing world of internet bingo. I could understand $10 for a year subscription. This is stupid and so are you if you pay for this product."
5,Danabor,I thoroughly enjoy this app. I find that it keeps me on my toes and i can still do most mental functions that i need to without being confused . Some of them are getting harder and because i am long past beginner i do struggle at 75 doing some of the memory games. Thoroughly recommend this app !
5,balderkel,"It‚Äôs probably a little early for me to leave a review, but I figure I can always update it. So far things are going well. I really enjoy playing the games they have. And if playing these games ends up helping the severity of my ADHD, that would be incredible! I‚Äôll update this in a few weeks.üòâ"
5,ifonephanatic,"Ok, maybe extreme, but seriously not far off. I‚Äôm slowly deteriorating and my mind is becoming more and more obvious that it‚Äôs struggling. I‚Äôve just only recently started using this app and I‚Äôve already noticed a comforting difference in improvement. I got the lifetime version and keep up my daily streak."
5,cynthia shill,"Love objective mind exercises and goals identified.  I feel more confident and positive in a short time , I am not only capable but confident . This is a valuable ap, without question!  Important to actively work to achieve optimal health This is a multidimensional toolbox of interactive experiences to provide mental exercise and support optimal mental activity !"
1,KevinWalker04,"Makes you take all these surveys THEN the subscription window pops up. They don't even have a ""no thanks"" option to continue in free mode. The only option they had was ""enable free trial"". Waste of energy if you aren't willing to pay for tests you can find online. If you are willing to pay, I can't comment on the specific features as I didn't buy it, but who knows, it could be the best paid service ever. Just don't waste your time and money if you aren't willing to pay for access to the app."
5,Corri406,"I‚Äôm someone who uses my phone to break up the monotony of my day, whether that be at work or watching tv. I can‚Äôt stand the mindless scroll of social media and there‚Äôs only so much solitaire a girl can play‚Ä¶ but Impulse exists! It‚Äôs not only a fun alternative, but it also has a positive influence on my brain - win win!"
5,Love Spicy,"I highly recommend paying for this app not only is it addictive but it helps you recall things you‚Äôve learned in school. (which definitely needs the dust brushed off) It also lets you know what percentile you scored in comparison to other people using the app, which is a little boost of confidence!"
5,beesweet69,"I have up to 19 head traumas. I am in need of brain training. I‚Äôve only used it one day, but so far I am extremely pleased. I like the positive reinforcement. When your comprehension level drops like mine, the second grade comprehension level because of my last open head trauma.. so far so good thank you"
5,Bracrach,I don‚Äôt usually like games. I honestly don‚Äôt usually like puzzles. I don‚Äôt like challenging myself with logic and such. It gives me a headache. But I DO for some reason really enjoy this app‚Äôs games and puzzles. They‚Äôre short and simple. I‚Äôm not sure about the science but hopefully it‚Äôs making my brain less lazy!!
5,jazminebrat,"This is very helpful and useful knowledge and learning as our brains processes different emotions and transformations, this app has games and cool information to help with whatever your dealing with as to mental health physically, mentally or even emotionally! If you‚Äôre trying to improve your brain, health, reduce stress, or more download this app I promise you won‚Äôt regret it !"
5,Hemiemmie,"Being an educator, it is true that daily exercise of the brain will improve memory, intelligence, and the ability to learn! I love the daily challenges and the IQ and trait quizzes are pretty accurate!  I have only played for two days but I have learned a lot about myself! I highly recommend this app!"
3,Ally4son,"I‚Äôve had this app over a year and really enjoyed it at first, however it‚Äôs just the same things over and over. They advertise new tests and games but once you take the basic ones, there are never new ones. Am I missing something? Some of the games advertised are not there, nor the tests. It‚Äôs gotten boring and I will not plan on renewing my paid subscription unless it changes."
5,Focus 2.5,"It‚Äôs always a good idea to keep the main frame in focus, and since, I‚Äôm at the tinder age of 65, I, definitely want to keep my main frame, oiled, and running on all cylinders. The, world that, I, was raised in is vastly changing on a daily, basis  and, if you don‚Äôt stay focused and on, your A, game, if not you either get left behind, or stepped, or stomped on"
1,Llama2.00009,"This game makes me more angry then calm. This game is supposed to make me feel calm and make my ADHD more controlled. After I tried to play a game I was sent to pay for a month or a year. I should not have to pay any money to calm my ADHD down this is the most stupidest scam I ever seen. If you don‚Äôt want to go broke because this game is stupid find a game that you can organize things to calm yourself down, adds are better than having to pay to calm your ADHD down. Moral of the story, don‚Äôt download if you don‚Äôt want to go broke and/or get angrier and not calm your ADHD."
5,its all about my king,"I‚Äôve been using Impulse for a while now, and I must say that I‚Äôm impressed with the app‚Äôs personalized training. The app focuses on certain parts of my brain, such as problem-solving, creativity, concentration, attention, and memory, and offers a variety of ways to perform mental training daily by playing amusing mind games  ."
5,Blondeleah,I guess it must be the kid and me that comes out so I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to explain why but I just love the sorting game and games like this on Impulse. It‚Äôs especially fun when you get a high score and that gives me a quick confidence boosters and just makes me feel a little smarter after playing a few rounds!
4,Oli1060,I am currently on the free trial. I love the games I am able to play. They are very fun and I can see how they can help distract you from anxiety. However I was hoping to see the tests and maybe I would actually subscribe. If I could see how this app would actually help me improve I would subscribe. The free trial only lets you play without the knowledge on how to improve.
5,MrsMoye,I‚Äôve been using the app when I feel anxiety building up or when I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôve also been using it at bedtime. The activities and diagnostics are the perfect way to ease anxiety and wind down. It has also helped my confidence level and my sense of accomplishment each day.
5,EM of CO,"I‚Äôm not into games. This piqued my interest with the personality assessments, complimented by various games to spark mental activity rather than aimlessly scrolling through social media for hours on end. Each tiny victory adds up, and motivation sets in with relevant comparisons to others in your age bracket. Beware, it‚Äôs addictive!"
5,Lisa P. from IN,I am new to impulse so still learning how to use it but it is easier each time. I like all the games and puzzles I have tried so far even ones I didn‚Äôt think I would like. It‚Äôs great to get the messages to prompt you to play. I am glad to have this as part of my new routine though out the day. Lisa P
5,sunnydetime,"The activities are fun and engaging. They keep your brain active and make you think. However, unlike some other brain stimulating apps, there was no frustration here. I welcome the areas where I need improvement and look forward to a higher score the next go round."
4,brachjason,"I switched from Elevate to Impulse recently and while Impulse has a larger variety of problem solving games, Elevate gives you tips if you‚Äôre struggling on a game. Impulse doesn‚Äôt give tips so it‚Äôs harder to learn effectively. Can the developers add tips and anything else to foster improvement instead of just repeating something you can‚Äôt figure out how to solve?"
4,Alesia411,I  a stroke survivor so I need the brain stimulation the only problem for me is it is  way to expensive for me to keep going on and get the full effect of how it will help. I wish there was a version for survivors of brain injury‚Äôs for free or really cheap. I can not work and I am on a fixed income barely making it. I want to give it a five  but I can‚Äôt because to expensive.
5,Oceanbrew,"Starts off simple which I really enjoyed starting classes online soon, so I wanted to see where I was at cause I haven‚Äôt been to school in a long time and it showed me. I have a lot to practice on, but I was grateful to have some thing that I didn‚Äôt have to pay for to help me you know, warm up my brain."
5,Intorko,"While I wish this was a free or less costly app, I must admit I do enjoy it. The only downside is it‚Äôs an annual membership when there are free apps available or games like Brain Academy for a one time purchase of $30 or less on sale. Other than cost, this app is amazing. And if you don‚Äôt mind paying, it‚Äôs worth it."
4,Julia Mas,This app is very fun and good for your brain but the only thing is that you have to pay for almost everything. Other than that for the seven day trial it is good for learning and quizzing your brain. There are also IQ tests to see what you get and then it gives a pretty accurate anwser. I would get this game but wouldn‚Äôt pay like the $70 a year but should try to 7 day trial.
5,Nicholas James Campbell,"This app is telling me nothing with self-discipline determination, willpower the level of intelligence that I didn‚Äôt know that I had if you‚Äôre looking for a daily challenge something to make you feel guilty. If you don‚Äôt do it in a reason to pick up your phone is actually beneficial download this app."
4,Kale‚Äôa,"I like is this because I can‚Äôt really help with Claire ministry and making it more or even stay more stronger and smarter especially when you‚Äôre out of school during summer break, you could lose a lot of knowledge so doing this without my brain, connect more faster with thinking in making decisions and is staying on the basic facts on things!"
5,B Shirk,"If you have trouble with basic brain function due to high amounts of stress and trauma, this app is for you! It tests you on different types of brain function. It starts at a kindergarten easy level and then you work your way up to harder and harder challenges!"
5,feetnite,If you struggle at school just download this game to remind your brain on some activities you be doing at school it‚Äôs like a quick reminder and it starts up your brain on little things to then big things instead of rushing at the big things the point is it‚Äôs nice to warm up your brain and train
5,NB Kate,I look forward to these every day. I like to start my day with the planned games and us random games to refocus throughout the day. I also recommend this to my clients especially any of my more mature who have noticed a dip in their memory and the improvements have been notable.
5,stuckinthepast,This is great for my dear sweet neurodivergent brain! By playing these helping games that make my attention away from the learning (since I have to work on not counting with my hands) and gaining! I highly recommend to anyone who has neuro-divergent brains who wants all the fun and learning - with out the school class room feel!
5,Agowatiha,I‚Äôve really enjoyed using this app. It‚Äôs really helped me focus and concentrate again. After having as many concussions as I‚Äôve had it‚Äôs been difficult to use cognitive functions as I once have. This app seems to be helping with that. Can‚Äôt wait to solve the next problem! Thank you.
5,üòéMickeyüòú,"The app is just amazing, it runs smoothly, has tons of mind games, it is very easy to use, and it is FREE! It sure has ads but they aren‚Äôt as persistent as in other apps, plus they don‚Äôt pop up every single second, and by not a lot of money you can buy the unlimited access and it is just‚Ä¶ awesome ‚òïÔ∏è"
4,Daego85,"This app is phenomenal, especially on the days when I wake up, and I‚Äôm just groggy and not all there. I can turn on this app and within five minutes after a few games feel mentally alert. Highly suggest this application to any business professional or anyone looking to improve your mental capacity."
5,salazar7515,Keeps working out my mind instead of just aimlessly playing video games that do nothing for me but waste time. Would recommend to everyone to try. Love the feature where it compres you to other people in the same age group making a little competition which I love.
5,BrainF0gM0m,I was looking for an app where I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with crappy ads and random notifications and this is it! The games are fun and I found myself remembering numbers at my job that I was struggling with previously. Highly recommend if you want something besides candy crush to play
3,Jasonmouse,"3 stars so ppl see it more, it‚Äôs honestly fun interactive games. Yes the price tag is scary but if you leave it and forget about it for like a week it‚Äôll give you crazy discounts like 96% off the yearly plan. Now if that was the base deal then I would be more inclined to be a repeat customer but understand that in times of massive wealth adversary we are facing at this time as a world, the deals really make or break customer loyalty and retention."
5,KasiusClah,Wide range of fun and different games. The more you do the easier they become as your brain gets it‚Äôs exercise. Makes me feel good about myself and it seems to slow down my ADD mind. Especially if I do it daily. I haven‚Äôt even paid for the premium and it‚Äôs still AWESOME!
2,CWCLT7,"When you first start the app, it seems you have to buy a subscription option. If you X that screen you get the free version‚Ä¶I‚Äôm thinking glad I tried clicking X because now I can try the app. Played a few rounds then SURPRISE!‚Ä¶I get an option to buy a subscription at a much lower price!  Shade. Not that I mind paying, but seems odd everyone gets a different deal. Shame because it seemed to have potential, though I‚Äôm not reading much in the reviews people‚Äôs real world benefits."
5,Teacher CES :-),There was a big buggy glitch in one of the games and I sent them information about it and in a few days the next update fixed the problem. They let me know they were fixing it as well.
1,Emily Vicent,"i‚Äôve never left a review but this app doesn‚Äôt care about wasting peoples time if it means they might make profit off of it. selfish marking tactics. i did the free trial so i could do the archetype test, well 72 questions later eith much time spend carefully answering the questions and i can‚Äôt see the results unless i pay! they make you think that you can use the app in full with the trial but its false!!! not a true trial.   the app may overall deserve more stars but my experience with it was one star ONLY."
1,maryjanewatson,"I pay for this app 95% for the candy sorting game bc it relaxes me‚Ä¶or it used to. WHY would you put a restart button right where the undo button was?!? I keep restarting my game by accident bc for over a year that space is where the undo button was. And now a game I used to use to relax myself when I‚Äôm anxious just sends me further into a rage üò§ please change it back!!   Also, give the option to clear completion history when you‚Äôve finished out all the levels. That would be awesome"
5,bdikehqojdbhsojdb,"I downloaded impulse when I looked for low storage games, found it and showed it to my friend. They played it for a minute or two and then downloaded it straight away. This is the best game for brain training, sleep, and reducing anxiety and stress. I would highly recommend it to anyone struggling with these items."
4,JamestheDad,"I do enjoy the training games and I do feel a boost during and after I participate in them. Ads are lame and so are paid subscriptions just to enjoy premium options‚Ä¶hopefully we can have positive options that are useful and don‚Äôt cost the common person extra $, soon in the future (Grants should help pay for this)"
5,HussNasty,"Played the first three games and I love it. Unless it‚Äôs a complete hoax and the makers of this game are in cahoots to mess with me. I need to find out more about myself! Unfortunately, I may have to pay for this subscription. Which I do not do generally on purpose. Definitely guilty of accidental subscriptions and follow up pleading phone calls. Lol"
2,wadesterk,"The app indicates you have full/free access during the 3 day trial period. You do not. Immediately upon completing tests they begin wanting money to unlock results. The testing is good with apt questions which is why 2 stars.  The lies, however, make those two stars as far as they go.  Logically this means their sole reason for granting the 3 day access is the hope some poor sap forgets and they then get to zap the person for right at $60.  Do not forget to unsubscribe would be my advice."
1,Teakayjee,"Yeah, I‚Äôve had this app for a few weeks now, found it just searching through the App Store.  Since installing it I‚Äôve been bombarded with ads on Facebook that are completely irrelevant to what is actually in the app, the final straw was an ad where it implied there was some sort of personality quiz that would determine your ‚ÄúMale Archetype‚Äù whatever that means.  Not only was said ad irrelevant to the actual content in the app, it was completely nonsensical. It was a graph with the different ‚Äúmale archetypes‚Äù with several personality traits that said ‚Äúmale archetypes‚Äù have in varying degrees.  I‚Äôm not going to go through all of them, but ‚ÄúThe creator‚Äù ‚Äúmale archetype‚Äù had one of, if not the lowest score in creativity.  I have no idea what their intention with these ads are, but if it‚Äôs to get people who already use your app to delete it, then good job it worked."
5,Pudgie McGee,"I love this app! I‚Äôve always enjoyed logic puzzles and pattern puzzles, so I was really excited to play it. What‚Äôs even better is that it works at whatever level I‚Äôm working with! I don‚Äôt have to worry about it being too easy. It gets challenging quickly. It‚Äôs only been a few days, but I‚Äôm addicted!"
5,James Geiser,"Whether it‚Äôs short, moderate, or long form brain exercises, this game has it all. Plus, it explains what each game is meant to help you with, and analyzes the data from your previous scores in order to further tailor future games. I‚Äôm only a couple days in but I like it a lot so far."
5,ùíúùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìÉùìéùìÇ‚Ñ¥ùìäùìà,My memory has improved greatly since I started using the app. I have even began to become more attentive to my surroundings. I appreciate how the creators always ask in what ways they can help make the user‚Äôs experience better for us. I am grateful and will continue use!
5,Bright09,"i‚Äôve completed tower of hoari like five times on different accounts, i‚Äôve completed max sliding puzzles twice and i‚Äôve done all 480 levels of robotic flows. so don‚Äôt get me wrong i love the game, however it‚Äôs sorta easy. i wish after i had beaten sliding puzzles a different harder puzzles appeared, and so on with every other game."
5,Ace of Diamondz,"This has a lot of little puzzles and games I like to play all in one, and I feel like I could really improve doing these quizzes. Whether it‚Äôs helping my memory or helping with math problems. Definitely recommend. I also got a slight discount which is crazy so totally worth my money in my opinion."
5,Cor_rine52,Please update the test! Most of the questions I was right down the middle wanting to hit both options and a few of them were a neither for me. It would have been nice to have those other opportunities. I had figure out on my own where I actually placed.
5,drying Chloe fusion symbol,First you don‚Äôt have to be smart to play this. This game is made for to help you mentally.   Second it is actually Reilly fun in myOpinion if you don‚Äôt like it you can say things you don‚Äôt like about it just don‚Äôt say to not get this game. So IF YOU are interested in it it‚Äôs actually a really good game in my opinion again.
5,ryan soulcract,"I‚Äôve just been playing for a short while but I‚Äôm enjoying myself and already feel inspired to purchase, though it is nice they allow you to play for free with ads (if you can call that free). But yes I will play some more for sure and potentially buy, I imagine you may feel the same."
5,Naag Nool,This app hasn‚Äôt only given me some much needed confidence in my intellect and brain capacity but I love the games! And it feels great to accomplish the challenges. I recently heard of these two nuns that lived to be 100+ but with the memory and recollection of a 20 year old because they would complete puzzles/brain games. This is my goal & Impluse is helping me get there. ü•∞
5,BoredomLifeYaKnow,"I just got the game a few days ago, but i really like it. I like that there is different games and challenges you can do. At first the games will seem easy but once you get on higher levels they actually begin to get challenging. Unlike some games where each level is practically the same."
5,KyraC103,"I really enjoy playing this game. It makes you think, and it gets your brain going. I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 5. It helps with different Types of weaknesses, that you would like to work on. It helps you focus, and helps u get better at anything you need to work on."
5,JJ/wolfygirlylovescookiesxxx,"It‚Äôs my first time playing and I‚Äôm already writing a review, I‚Äôve tried other brain workout apps like this and they were good but for some reason the games here appeal more to me. They have the same premise as other brain games, but the visuals are more appealing to me. I recommend giving this app a try."
4,A290312,"This is a pretty good app to help with memory and relaxation, the only thing that I would change is the prices. The prices are crazy, I think it is $6 a week for an app!!!!!! I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to pay that. I just stick with the free version, but just so you know, you can‚Äôt access the results to tests without the paying version."
5,LilD33R,"I just wish it was 100% free and not just for a trial period either‚Ä¶ Being a stay at home mom of two that homeschools, I can‚Äôt afford any subscriptions other than the ones I pay for now for my kids homeschooling program. This app is great for me in helping with my ADHD as well as my son whom also has ADHD."
5,vball0813,"This game has become part of my daily routine, and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready for the day. In today‚Äôs world, people don‚Äôt do a lot to challenge themselves or keep a good mental state, and this app allows for both. The payment plans are absolutely worth it in the long run!! Highly recommend!!"
5,AvaJencinas,"I downloaded this game because I wanted to improve my memory and my overall brain power, I have been playing for a couple days in a row and it really helps improve my memory and I feel like my mind is sharper and I am able to concentrate and build that brain muscle!"
5,Eizzeee,This app is honestly the most useful tool for anyone wanting to improve their intellect & comprehension skills. I highly would recommend this app to everyone. The games are both entertaining and great for memorization skills. Tests give you results and statistics. The impulse app is refreshing againüíóüíóüíó I genuinely enjoy it!! DOWNLOAD
5,AlyssaAnderson89,I absolutely enjoy the different exercises that impulse offers and I like that they offer notifications to remind me everyday or how ever often I like. I also like when I open the app it says your training is ready for you it makes me feel like it‚Äôs made specifically for me.
5,Outshinebarber,"Great for training every part of the brain, everyone should be doing these exercises but since they aren‚Äôt I feel this will give you such an edge..it‚Äôs only day one and I can‚Äôt get enough of it, can‚Äôt wait to see how it molds my life going forward!"
5,J. Mike Rosner,"Love ‚Äòbrain Games‚Äô. This Seems good so far, challenging; I like it.  I‚Äôd been ‚Äòplaying‚Äô these-type ‚Äògames‚Äô for ~(seemingly) Years now. Impulse truly is a fantastic exercise which Feels much like a game.   My Severe TBI has improved exponentially since I‚Äôd begun my training regiment. Impulse has also become a regular aspect of my ‚Äòregular‚Äô recovery efforts now, as well!!"
1,Extremertab22,"I was trying out the 3 day trial right? The game already put a hold on the $7 or $6.99 if you wanna be specific, so I thought it was a little weird but whatever. After playing the game a little bit, the next day I cancelled the trial, because the game wasn‚Äôt my type of thing. Usually the money on hold should come back to my bank account a couple days after cancelling the trial, but it didn‚Äôt. The app stole my $7. It‚Äôs not a big deal but I‚Äôm a minor without a job so it felt like a lot of money to me even if it wasn‚Äôt."
5,SpockJenknsTOS,"After having a ‚Äúmini stroke‚Äù due to complications from a vaccine, I have been suffering from a number of health issues, including brain fog, and uncoordinated typing. This program has been helpful in both monitoring, assessing, and training to improve my condition."
4,Jbug10,"I like this app, a lot of stuff is great. Just wish a lot of stuff you don‚Äôt have to pay for. The app doesn‚Äôt realize that you could just buy individual apps that offer different things instead of having to pay it for it to just be in one app. I think a lot more people would keep the opposite offered more."
3,Nadjaaa123456789,"Im a high school student, and have been playing this for a while, it really gives my brain a workout! I even found myself playing this instead of just some arcade games. However, a lot of the games that it has for you to play in your free time are only available with the subscription, and the subscription is a bit pricey‚Ä¶  But overall a really good tool to enhance your brain function!"
1,sdan,"One of those instagram ads with a simple looking game - turns out game is not part of this app - terrible money grabbing practices due to subscription models present to restrict access to games.  Response to developer: fake advertising is not a brain development strategy - I decided to try your game and it was a switch and bait - most blatant one from the games I've tried on the app store - just change your business practices by making quality products that people would love to spend their money on - this is pathetic, sorry."
4,bgubjb,"Impulse is a great brain game! It is much better than many other games because it has a daily workout/goals set for you when you arrive. The games are fun, new,amd different! The reason this is not a 5 star review is because there are in app purchases but that is really the only downside I can see. I love this game and I will keep using it for a long time!!"
5,mon_vi,I love this app. It‚Äôs like a little sliver of fun mid day :) I especially like the impulse games and the one where you have to put all the same candies in one slot. And also the IQ test has these matching games that I really enjoyed. I wonder how accurate those results were though.. I‚Äôd like to put it on my resume. üòÜ
5,The Vamp Poet,Apart of being healthy is not just a healthy body but also a healthy brain and this app can help with that. This app is full of fun and great challenges that keep you on your toes.  After  a few weeks I feel like a can handle the mental grind and have more clarity throughout the day. I recommend it even if it‚Äôs just for fun.
1,B. Rennard‚ô™(¬¥ŒµÔΩÄ ),Though the games are fun this app is a scam. IÔ∏è should have read the reviews before downloading. While playing the app IÔ∏è got the option to chose a ‚Äúprize‚Äù that was a discount on the yearly fee. IÔ∏è choose 92% off however after purchasing IÔ∏è quickly realized IÔ∏è got scammed. When looking in the App Store you only get 2 subscription options a 70% off and 63% off each close to $30. So IÔ∏è canceled my subscription and will definitely follow up with my bank to note them if they try to charge me again. Watch out for the tricky app!!!
5,DeliaAthena,"The games are fun, so they go quickly, and they are different enough so that there is always something new and I don't get bored. Each game is different enough so that I feel I am testing varied skills and there are the right amount of each type of game so that it doesn't get tedious."
3,Slutoshi nakamoto,"Dont usually leave reviews but this pushed my button Saw an ad on instagram and have a similar app installed (and paid for) so I'm the type to pay here also if I see something I like  Downloaded it for a specific game, that shows on the ad but doesn‚Äôt exist in the actual app. Then when I tested my ADHD it collected SO MUCH PERSONAL DATA, and then blackmailed me to pay in order to see results. Needless to say, deleted."
5,EVIL MIKE,Enough of these mind numbing games . When I get a few minutes of downtime I‚Äôve committed myself to seeing what kind of changes I can make in myself to be happier and more confident . This app is wonderful . Don‚Äôt let age and life dull your sharp edges . Use impulse to stay strong !
1,Kya Quatel,This app is always advertised as ‚Äúhelping you find your trauma type‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat kind of anxiety‚Äù you have. Then it immediately tries to manipulate you into signing up for their service by promising you way more than it could possibly do. I wouldn‚Äôt even assume a personal therapist was capable of doing all the things this app claims to do. It would take different specialist.  I see other reviews saying they can‚Äôt cancel. Screams scam. I hate when people use psychology to trick people. Don‚Äôt get this app.
5,Mrs. Carrabba One Day,I‚Äôm not one to sit and play games on my phone even though I know I could benefit from a mental break from everything else going on all the time. But using Impulse has been fun for me as well as insightful while also still giving me a sense of accomplishment.
5,Azagoth13,I have been looking for an app that will help keep me mentally sharp & focused for a while.  This app has helped beyond measure.  I have begun to have my normal processing speeds return in most areas and in others it has begun expanding my gifts.  Highly recommend for all that want to keep their mental faculties‚Äô youthfulness.
5,.!.!!.!!.!,I‚Äôm sitting at work on a stand down. This app helps me with trying to sharpen my brain for I have a head injury and since it happened I have a horrible time remember things even to as how old I am! So I would say it‚Äôs a fun way to memorize things and sharpen you brain capacity.
1,Alphaw51,"Like okay I can understand ASKING people to buy a 4$ a week subscription but omg they will block out everything EVEN IF YOU DO BUY THE CHEAPEST ONE. The creators of this are so greedy it's out of touch with the real world. Make an app, ALLOW people to support the app, don't shove more adds and subscriptions down their throats by gate keeping the results of the test you just wasted 10 mins over just to be told to spend more money. If you subscribe to this app your more lost than asking google for relationship advice."
1,Chelsea1263,im actually so fed up with thisüò≠ i didn‚Äôt have enough money in my account and i cancelled right away cuz i didn‚Äôt mean to get it. they still want me to pay for a year when i didn‚Äôt even press a year but pressed a week. i was supposed to have a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù BUT NEVER GOT IT AND THEY WANNA CHARGE ME FOR A FREAKING YEARüò≠ Now the app store won‚Äôt let me get apps when i try to download apps because it wants me to verify my payment method and when i try to it doesn‚Äôt work. don‚Äôt trust the subscriptions on this app. they‚Äôre just trying to take your money.
5,edog1316,I love this app sooooo much since it‚Äôs almost summer I want my brain to keep working. This app helps with anxiety which it calms me down. Whenever I finish my games I always feel accomplished üòÇ. The app helps with memory and tells you your stats at the end of each game.  Just in case people can‚Äôt tell I LOVE IT
5,trevorsnarr,"This app is absolutely amazing! Bravo, to all the hard workers that put this together to make sure that our brains don‚Äôt go amok with the onset of AI.   We can all come together and make sure our brains continue to work despite the easiness of what technology provides us.   Let‚Äôs do this for our human brains!!üß†"
5,Orion's fly guy,"I have been retired 15 years now. And over the last few years I‚Äôve noticed a decline the speed with which I problem solve. I will now focus on one project at a time while ignoring other impactful issues. Good or bad? I don‚Äôt know. Also, remembering names of new people‚Ä¶faces‚Ä¶no problem."
5,sushdjdjxnsojdb,"Yes, I indeed gave this a five star review. Thanks to this app, I feel more confident and comfortable with different aspects of the world. This really made me think about what my life actually is. Please if you really are struggling call someone, but if you‚Äôre not that far, this app makes you feel calm, cool, and collected. Try this app!"
5,LegendSportsGRP,"Love this game so far, theres tons of different activities to and tools to use for sharpening memory and critical thinking skills, response times, hand/eye coordination etc. i can see my self enjoying this for a long time to come. Challenging and difficult at the same time as rewarding and entertaining."
4,dniseyp,I like the brain training games. Short and effective- because they are basic but challenging (even though they don‚Äôt feel like they should be- which makes me aware of my need to do these types of exercises! I would like having little scientific explanations of how they how they work. Like the science behind the activity.
1,ZeeeeüéÄ,"The instagram ads are cool because they make want to take the tests BUT even with the free trial, you cannot get the results of any test unless you pay for a subscription! I knew once I was the ‚Äúin-app purchases‚Äù sign in the App Store that it would do that. Then there‚Äôs an ad where you ‚Äúwin‚Äù (I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs shown to everyone) 92% off the subscription to try to make you hurry up and buy because wow you just got 92% off‚Ä¶. nice try. Thanks for nothing! *don‚Äôt forget to end your free trial before you delete the app!*"
5,BabyHerc15,This app is awesome!! Honestly it‚Äôs fun kills time gives you a great deal of self awareness of your skills and makes you want to improve all while helping your brain learn on so many levels. Highly recommend this to all ages young teenagers mid life and the old it‚Äôs a must get for anyone really! Nice work!
5,Daisysunkiss78,"Little mini games keep things fun while really honing in on your mental acuity, working memory, problem solving and so much more. No matter what kind of games you like, there‚Äôs sure to be something here for you and you will see a different in your mental abilities pretty quickly."
5,trishyann 74,With so much information and tasks sometimes you need a little extra help to ensure that you‚Äôre doing everything to exercise your cognitive strength. This helps with that while improving areas that you need to work on while being fun at the same time.
5,Q-Dog/Baby,"Parents should be aware that Impulse is a highly kid-friendly puzzle game with a low entrance barrier that offers a natural introduction to the physics of mass, velocity, and trajectory without being overtly didactic. It was intended to cover Newton's laws of motion and was created by researchers. But the gaming is challenging, and without support or a player base, young players can lose interest."
5,rezaroze,This app is really helping me to get it together to be able to stop focus and concentrate on what the next step is instead of rushing in without paying attention. I‚Äôm really enjoying this out very much and I think it‚Äôs doing me a lot of good thank you thank you thank you so much for this app.
5,camodogamingfan,I am enjoying the app so far- have only played once but I think over time it will help me keep my brain working better. Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in our family so I want to keep my brain healthy. Starting at my age (60) is probably a good idea as the onset for us appears to be in our 80s.
5,Buckeye Grandma,I am a 66 year old female and I have some memory issues at times.  My family is concerned so I have been enjoying the impulse games that are letting me use my brain and helps me prove I am doing fine and it is not as serious as some people think.  I have scored well and will continue to use daily!
5,Eli üôÇ,I really like this app and all its tests/quizzes  And that the app works offline too! But I would really appreciate if there could be less adds when I am online because unless I get premium I have to deal with like 20 adds in one training session. Otherwise this app is awesome.
5,reddigjr,"I had recently been struggling with remembering things so I looked up puzzle games on the App Store and saw this. From the first game I played to the last I fell in love. This is the most fun I‚Äôve had with puzzles in a long time, 10/10 highly recommend for anyone looking to have fun or strengthen that brain!!"
5,mameme07,"Great great mind game makes your mind think which way to go what you doing what you‚Äôre looking for I thought I did it. I did 90% 98%. I want to keep going. It just makes me want to keep going and going to see how far I can push myself concentrate how high I keep getting, anybody else but myself"
1,Mlshuck,"Do not get this app. You cannot cancel your subscription. In the app it tells you to cancel through your Apple subscriptions. However, because they bill your account directly it show under subscriptions that this app is free. I‚Äôve reached out via the app twice and never received a response. I also reached out through Apple and never received a response. I‚Äôm deducted $39 and change about every 25 days directly from my debit card. Again, do not get this app."
5,Persephone836020,I loved it literally such a wonderful app i use it everyday starting first thing w he n i wake up in t he morning and before I go to bed i love this soooo much i would most definitely recommend this to you and I‚Äôm saying this because I‚Äôve already recommended it to all my friends :( ü©∂ü©∂üåôü•≤üëºüëºüëºüëºüëº
4,Alyx Stone,"I like this game a lot. I love brain training games, and this one is a big help for me. I have ASD, so games like this are good when I need something to do, something to hyperfixate on, or if I‚Äôm feeling anxious or stressed. I guess I could say that my only problem is that I, as a child, cannot pay for the pro version, but that‚Äôs only a minor thing. I love Impulse either way. Great game."
4,girliepop$$,This is an awesome training game but the main reason i got it was to help with certain things like ADHD but when i took the these for ADHD it said i had to get the trail (which costs money) before i could have the results which was disappointing it's still a great game but i would love to have more free stuff such as results from tests and such.
5,Jbra222,"I love this app. Instead of mindless scrolling on social media, I can easily spend the time on here and be productive while I have fun playing the games. I also love how the games are easy enough for my 5 year old who especially enjoys playing the candy sorting game with me! Highly recommended"
5,A6572‚öΩÔ∏è,This app is the best app for fun calming games. And for building memory it‚Äôs awesome . And I‚Äôve had this app for 2 days only and I already love it . And also I‚Äôve had it for two days and haven‚Äôt came across a single problem or ad . You should download It if you want good memory and fast reaction. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,mswamom,I have really enjoyed using Impulse. I feel like it has improved both my attention and memory significantly in a relatively short amount of time. I spend less than 10 minutes a day using it and I have been using it daily for 3 months.
5,JuSi1126,I have had issues finding a way to refocus my brain before and after long study sessions. These brain training games have been an excellent source of distraction that I can count on to give me brain a break from study material while also keeping me in the zone to focus! Love it!
5,DesignDevineDiva,"Of all of the many exercises I‚Äôve put my brain through in my life, this is one of the most satisfying. The effects are similar to the feeling you have doing one of your favorite activities - stretching yourself to be better. Yes, I recommend this experience as improving your state of mind."
1,LenkaGao,I downloaded the app out of the curiosity if I‚Äôm going to like the app. I should have been able to cancel subscription within a week but in my Apple settings I‚Äôm not able to cancel it. I emailed the support per the policy - you should be able to cancel subscription by sending the email about cancellation and no answer yet. Hopefully I won‚Äôt be charged $6.99/week for app I don‚Äôt even want and I‚Äôm not even able to cancel it! Hopefully the support will reach out to me soon!
5,sometime banker,The games and tests on the app are actually quite a bit of fun. It‚Äôs like many of the free games that you can get in the App Store but with this app there‚Äôs more of a purpose behind it then selling you something or wasting your time you‚Äôre actually doing something you‚Äôre improving yourself
5,davijoma,This is exactly what I need to boost my mental prowess. I encouraged my husband to get the app as well. We set aside a few minutes each day to da our daily challenges. It takes a few short minutes but reaps great reward because I feel myself becoming more adept and more focused.
5,paijearenee,I have suffered a Tramatic brain injury from a car accident almost one year ago to today‚Äôs date. I have amnesia in which I‚Äôm taking dementia medication for. It is helping. But playing this game has made me feel like I‚Äôm in control of something in my thought process. I‚Äôm really enjoying this app.
3,Kitasluv,"I‚Äôm so tired of seeing adds for that stupid King who needs to be saved. It‚Äôs on every game I play and honestly, after downloading it and playing it I was bored right away.  If there were different adds and maybe only at the beginning of the challenge day I wouldn‚Äôt mind. But to have to go through it 2 or three times every day I play just makes it not worth it."
3,Eggmuffims,I use the app to do the daily training each day which consists of 5 different games. In that timespan I am usually shown 12 ads. You get an ad before you play the game. You get an ad after you finish the game. You get an ad before you go to the next game. Ads are fine but when 70% of the time I‚Äôm on the app for the daily challenge is ads it gets kind of annoying.
5,Darkdogtbad,"I found this app to really help me in practical ways. It makes you focus on the game and helps with not only your memory but, problem solving, and spatial recognition. You he games force me to concentrate and as a result I feel very relaxed. It is perfect for a person like me who overthinks too much. Well done!!!!"
5,KIMAR96,Im relatively new to the app but so far it‚Äôs helping me feel more productive. I like the fact that your going against yourself and it tracks your progress. I can‚Äôt wait to see an improvement on my mental math. Y‚Äôall should make a version where you play with your family that‚Äôd be lots of fun.
5,clarastyle.72,"The challenges are designed to exercise different parts of the brain and consistent practice helps me think and deduct ideas faster. Interestingly enough, I noticed a byproduct of this practice. Working on these exercises ‚Äúlight a fire‚Äù in my overall state of mind so it shifting me out of a sadness, depression or any lower state to a higher, brighter mood."
5,Smartie Spice,"I got this app to help stretch my brain and improve my brain function in day to day life. Although it may seem like a bunch of kid games it actually is semi-challenging, but not in a way that makes you want to quit. I also heard keeping your brain active can prevent dementia so this app would be a good way to do that."
5,Kimbroolay,"Enjoying the app so far. Definitely gets your brain going and stimulated. I would like to see more depth on how I compare to my peers in the progress section. Not quite grasping that part, but otherwise I‚Äôm making this app a daily part of my day and enjoy it a lot."
5,QueenJ4765,It helps me a lot and my anxiety used to be very bad and after only 2 days of doing this game. I have been able to calm down and not have those panics. Highly recommend this for people that have anxiety and for people who want to have more brain muscle like me. Definitely recommended
5,Joshb2424,There are a plethora of different games to constantly keep your brain entertained. The tests section can help you better understand yourself. Look forward to completing all the levels of each game. I would definitely recommend giving this app a try.
5,Naa Tso Tso,I love this because it is a game with a purpose. I know I am struggling with memory and have two parents with Alzheimer‚Äôs issues. I wish I knew about this for them.  It‚Äôs fun educating and targeted on just what I need. Fun Functionally Targeted Memory sit ups for the brain. When and Where will the Memory Olympics begin
5,VinCenT0605,"I use this app for focus, memory, and for fun! I like setting my daily goals and I like being surprised that I‚Äôm better than I thought I was at any given game at times. This encourages me to keep playing, which in the end, is helping you achieve your goals for using the app. Have fun playing!"
4,menssewnanne,"I wish this app was able to not have ads in the free version like Elevate does , but I understand why they do and it‚Äôs not that big of a deal just slightly annoying because I like to go go go - but definitely recommend giving this a try because there  are really fun/helpful games :)"
5,Morgangirl6,"I love as feeling brain fog constantly, likely due to my nightly gummy intake to sleep and stress. Impulse has helped remind me that I am not stupid, just getting old and overwhelmed. I feel alive and ready to prove my intellect after I play a while. It‚Äôs very much a daily routine I need to continue and will not soon stop for anything. I needed this!"
5,Mocah1,"My former position as a manager in the aviation field required attention to detail, critical thinking, and problem solving. Now that I‚Äôm retired, I have not had to practice these skills to that degree I did before.  With this app, my brain is definitely getting a work out the more I play it‚Ä¶it is helping to keep me sharp!"
4,Meri Equestrian,"Not sure exactly how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù this stuff is for your brain but it is fun. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the amount of paywalls. I get it, the devs have to sell the premium to pay themselves, but I can‚Äôt even see the results of a test that took me 20 minutes without a micro transaction. The games are fun but the rest of the app isn‚Äôt much without the premium."
1,Yetanotherbusymommy,I downloaded the app through an ad on Instagram. I am still in the trial period but can‚Äôt seem to find it in my subscriptions order to cancel it and there is no way for me to know if I am actually subscribed or not. I tried messaging the developer but the messaging system on their website doesn‚Äôt work. I am not happy about not being able to know if I will start being charged and I can‚Äôt find a way of cancelling it. Things should be easy and clear and they are not.
5,jbfrmalafreakinbama!!!,"Basically put I‚Äôm the most impulsive person I know. This app has helped me sharpen my focus, identify distraction, remember that I too can still do basics like mathematics since I hardly ever use those skill everyday, now I can do those basic maths without pulling out my phone to use the calculator ü§£ü§£ü§£ Enjoy impulse!!! I sure do!!!ü•∞"
5,israelizzmaticizzy,"Honestly pretty fun. Lot of games that were played as a kid but with a competitive twist that challenges the mind‚Ä¶ or maybe I‚Äôve just been out of school for a while lol but no still really fun, lots to do and I‚Äôve barely started. I paid the one time subscription because I move like that. I recommend."
3,Dimitri1177,When you initially download the game it presents 3 subscription options making you think you have to pick one.   That‚Äôs a bit shady if you ask me.   Now if you didn‚Äôt fall for the subscription choices you can have an ad supported free version.   I completely understand the need for ads on a free version and am not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be.  That ad to game ratio is a bit much though.
5,Petebodi reviews,"As I played impulse to improve my attention,focus, and memory, I noticed a change in my eyesight and also focus!  You can get up to 92% off this game which puts you at around $20 a year which is a great price!!  I will continue using impulse to better help my brain and thinking,just wow!"
5,mariposa_latina,I just started and I love how it tailors your learning. You are able to see how you compare to others your age so it helps you see what you could use improvement on. I feel it is more accurate than taking an online test.
5,Bunniexoxox,It gives you memory with ghosts and you have to tap the numbers in the right order. When I first downloaded it I thought it would be super easy but it was a little hard and it was a lot better then I thought it was going to be!üôå
1,Gezrii,"Don‚Äôt believe the ads.  Got the premium after seeing an ad about unique tests like what kinds of male characters archetypes we‚Äôre drawn to say about you and it seemed interesting. Other unique ones show up on TikTok ads   Turns out no such quizzes exist - just your typical psych evaluation quiz and duolingo style games. Highly disappointed, which I could get my money back. I thought they were locked behind premium but they weren‚Äôt and trial wasn‚Äôt an option even tho the app page says it."
3,Audj pudj,"I hate it how you have to have a subscription. I don‚Äôt think that is necessary, but I also really like it because you get to do some very cool and amazing games to help your brain out that is very cool and that is also very creative to do thank you to the app makers. If you would like to add some additional things I would say you should not have to have a subscription, but thanks again love Audrey"
1,ThatOneGuy421,"I almost never leave reviews , but this app try's to pressure you to spend money instantly. It even has this little game pop on the screen with 3 choices for you to pick one ‚Ä¶..after you pick., CONGRATULATIONS you can buy it for 1 year at 90% off (but only on this screen it says)   So I just close it out ‚Ä¶..then I answer 72 questions about myself (took a while)  and AFTER I‚Äôm done it tells me I have to pay to see the report, then it offers me the 90% off again lol  I instantly closed out and ended my free trial"
1,Kymmi68,"The three day premium trial isn‚Äôt really a full trial of premium. Every time you try to do something it offers you a huge discount on the subscription. But the catch is that instead of a three day trial and then the discounted subscription, trying to redeem the discount will start your subscription immediately and you lose the three days free to check the app out. I gave up trying to evaluate the app because of the inability to get a true free trial so I‚Äôll never know if it was worth the money."
4,quejav,"Games are stimulating but needs to be assorted  or varied, not prolonged on one game , per day.  Also if the game , player should be warned if a game is being timed or a timer should pop up, because it seems to affect my scores and it doesn‚Äôt  make sense that my score is lower than others when I just took my time playing the game."
5,GoldenPants123,"There‚Äôs plenty of apps available on the net, and I have tried quite a few. However, Impulse appears to be much more sophisticated. I have only scratched the surface (as it were). I look forward to continue using this tool and improving my mental acuity."
5,autumnnapoli,"I‚Äôm still very new at using this app, so I‚Äôm not sure how great the results are, but the games are fun, well-designed, user-friendly, and engaging. I can‚Äôt wait to get to more difficult levels. And I love that they have side games and puzzles to play in between your personalized exercises everyday."
5,Miko Yae,"I thought I'd try it out cause I wanted to improve my mental capacity/health and it's really fun plus the games focus on different things and actually help. For me, I get daily games for memory, problem solving, and attention. It'd help more if I was consistent but it still did sum in the week that I've used it"
4,"Good deal, okay tests","This is my second day on the app, the games are fun, but I feel as if the tests and scores are just saying the nice things about me. I‚Äôd like to think I am smart, but it feels at little patronizing. I did get a really good deal for a year subscription, and there is a lot to do on the app. Look forward to seeing more!"
5,Cetuck,"The puzzles and brain training games are so fun and they are the same games I see commercials for.  The difference is, on Impulse the games are organized and presented in a meaningful and deliberate manner to address my individual needs!  I‚Äôve learned so much about myself already!"
5,rianleigh07,"I would be obsessed with this app if it had half the amount of ads. This app has sooooo much potential to be my favorite app. Currently, the free version is really annoying. For every game you play or quiz you try to take, you watch 1-2 minutes of ads."
5,haner naner,I downloaded this game because I saw it on tiktok I kinda knew it was going to ask for money for a trial and all that and It did. But it‚Äôs been amazing there‚Äôs still so many games open for playing and tips and information. I love it so much and it‚Äôs definitely entertaining for my adhd
4,Prometheus508,"I don‚Äôt even write these things but I was incensed just enough to do so, this is a great app I just wish it included the family share option for the amount of money you‚Äôre paying for the annual subscription. Otherwise 90% better than DOOM Scrolling (although you‚Äôd do even better outside touching grass and writing poetry in longhand)"
5,Sparrow514,I love brain games and puzzle games because they are fun but especially because I am in my sixties and want to stay mentally sharp. So many great games to play and I really love that the app does not track my personal info like all other apps I have tried. Highly recommended.
5,5gamesaday,"So, the games are calming to me- my brain enjoys the fodder not attached to gem like candies. I like that most of the games are going to reinforce skills needed every day! Memory / recall puzzles of all kinds, math skills- money,  simple math. I enjoy the independence of going at my own pace, and there is no penalty here- no lost points, level, etc."
5,Love Fish Tacos not one many,"This is by far the best I‚Äôve found. .The games are super fun ,and are those typical games that remind me of my youth ,  As you progress a simple matching game can be brutal which can leave you thinking about what needs to change In your own life ,in order to feel safe about any task you face in real life ..üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
5,samiam396,Super good for my brain and benefits me in so many ways. Love playing this game when I‚Äôm bored instead of just scrolling through hours of nonsense on social media that doesn‚Äôt benefit my brain what so ever. This app is awesome and I wish I had the money to play it more. Thanks so much for creating such an awesome app!! -samantha pate from Yosemite
5,littlest day,"This game is awesome because it allows for both mental improvement and relaxation at the same time. I‚Äôm not a math person whatsoever, but using this the past few days helps me feel like I‚Äôm learning more simply by reviewing stuff we don‚Äôt have time to review in upper levels of school. 10/10!!"
5,Ot.hdc,I just started with this app and so far I really like the variety of brain games available. I really like the descriptions of what the different skills are and trying to beat previous scores. I want to work on focus and visual memory skills and I think this app works for those areas well!
5,Lyssafromthegoldengates,"I love the app!! I love the games, it helps me relax and enjoy the small things in life. My job is full of stress and extreme anxiety! This app helps keep my speed and agility alive! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how much you have to pay to unlock the full game!! Other than that I adore it, and appreciate the time and effort of the creators! God Bless!"
5,Jinx and rock,"Yes, please your mind moving and I really like it because I need something to keep my mind straight and off the narrow way. So far, I have enjoyed all the games the candy one and the other one I gave it five stars because I‚Äôve not played any brain games as excitingthank you so much.      Debbie M."
5,AhntTeeTee,"Love the personality insight testing  and results.  Games are fun and immediate feedback on your performance and comparison to other‚Äôs results is interesting.  Games are short, and generally easy to do, while helping  brush up on all general skills and knowledge that fade over the years without use."
1,FaultFindz,"Don‚Äôt waste your money on this faulty launch. It will ask you if you want a free trial, and tell you that you won‚Äôt be billed for 5 days, right before it automatically withdraws $17 from your account.. then let‚Äôs you do a few tests before making you commit to a plan.. or else it won‚Äôt show you any results of your tests. It will also disclaim that these are all games for entertainment purposes mostly. I will delete and unsubscribe, I can get better brain training from a crossword puzzle."
1,Marcel Stratu,"I downloaded this app thinking the 3-day free trial would give me a good idea of how it works, but boy was I wrong. After spending a long time completing a quiz with 40 questions, I expected to at least see some results. Nope! Turns out you need to pay to see any results at all, which completely defeats the purpose of a free trial. The trial doesn‚Äôt offer enough access to really evaluate anything, so it feels like a total waste of time. If you‚Äôre looking for transparency, skip this one."
5,klele5,"The games are really fun, slightly challenging and increasing as you progress, and I can tell a difference already after the first two days! I have a lot of short term memory issues so I thought about giving this a try and I‚Äôm so glad that I did!!"
5,Cvreyy,I am so happy to be subscribed to this App!! I knew I needed to be doing some kind of ‚Äúmind gym‚Äù and this is so good! It offers a great variety and it explains each game in a very good way . I never enjoyed any kind of memory game but just because I am not good at it! I know I need this !! And this App got me engaged!!  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
4,Another Amandaüíï,"I have been using this app for 6 months. I absolutely love it. It has helped me tremendously with math and focusing. However, one complaint. I am on level 525 of Candy Sort and it‚Äôs glitching so bad. I have waited through a few updates to see if it fixed but it still is really bad and frustrating."
5,gigigigigigianna,"Since its the summer I want to improve before the next school year begins, this has helped me train my mind while being productive, the one problem is the ads, I am glad you can skip them after five seconds though."
5,Hstopp.DarkSquishy,This app is so good! It helps me keep on track with testing my brain everyday and I love the fact that each game in the app has its badge! It makes me wanna get them all and the games are so fun! There are only some that I don't quiet like as well as the others but they are still so much fun!
5,Kaitsa,I was recently diagnosed with adhd and being able to understand why I did things the way it did helps me manage my impulses and reactions. This app has helped me take a break and also see how good I am with puzzles. This app helps me focus and somehow it gives me peace too
1,ansapa87,"You should let people know when they lpen a test that they wont have access to the results unless tou oay for an annual membership. I wasted half an hour soing 2 tests, just to not be ae to read the results. I have a 3-day free trial for a monthly membership. Are the tests only available for the annual memberships? Why do you allow us to waste time completing tests when at the end you just to try to upsell us? I literally cancelled my free trial after encountering this money grab."
1,God O. M.,"I bought the lifetime membership a couple of months ago and had to switch Apple ID‚Äôs due to my account being compromised. When I logged in with my previous email I noticed that I didn‚Äôt have the membership anymore. When I contacted customer service to explain the situation both Apple and Impulse said that I need to purchase the lifetime membership again. So, at the end of the day, they got their money, but I didn‚Äôt get their service!!!!  No thanks for the apology! Talk is cheap!"
1,Stefanieeee,got app cuz of a dumb instagram ad for the joke of it. didn‚Äôt like the app so i deleted it and cancelled the subscription THE SAME DAY. and i know i cancelled so dont try and tell me i didn‚Äôt. now i was charged 3 days later?? FOR WHAT i don‚Äôt gave a subscription nor the app even on my phone jesus talk about money hungry. i better not be charged again next week or ever again. Requested a refund from apple :). No clue how they do it since i literally don‚Äôt have an active subscription how does it feel to take peoples hard earned money?
5,RareFury,"This app is a sophisticated tool to help our minds improve our ability to remember, to do basic daily tasks without anxiety. ""Impulse‚Äù is something everyone can benefit from, especially if you‚Äôre growing older and feeling the mental decline as most of us do."
4,Mamabee214,It‚Äôs not just the kids who forgets certain things of mathematics and puzzles. The adults as well. Especially for those who has memory problems.   I don‚Äôt just do the brain training 7 days a week for random things.  I even try to learn the new ways of teaching for my children as well.
5,Waldoshshrjrkxo,I‚Äôve only been using it for two days but my mind feels more clear almost like their is less pressure on my mind. It‚Äôs challenging and fun. The games are more fun then most of the games I‚Äôve downloaded for fun. Let‚Äôs see if it makes any lasting changes.
5,Kimsuepow,it challenges my brain but yet it is doable. I don‚Äôt get discouraged because it is too hard. I definitely think it will help overtime. My memorization definitely needs improvement and ability to process things quickly with details and accuracy..
5,uziquick,So far I‚Äôve really liked this because I feel like I‚Äôm doing something much more useful with my time then scrolling on media apps. This app has help me be better at thinking and making decisions rather than sitting and learning nothing
5,feivel mousekewitz,"I'm really liking Impulse so far as a nice challenge in various ways for how my neurodivergent brain works. I'm playing games that test my relatively slow processing speed, working memory, spatial processing, stress responses, etc. Super interesting and not upsetting me so far when I don't finish timed games."
5,Scott_Rich,"Definitely a productive, yet fun way to brush up on skills you typically start slacking on as the world becomes busier. Each type of game has its challenges, but it‚Äôs interesting to see where you rank among your peers. As someone who can think, but quite average, I was surprised how well I‚Äôve compared."
5,AplhaFemale,"I enjoy impulse so much, as someone who left school early and has experienced a lot of trauma, this app is helping me majorly improve my skills mentally and also leaves me feeling really positive the only two negative things I can say is it is pricey and I think it should be a seven day free trial instead of three days."
5,AcE-K-2/03,"What an incredible test of your mental skills. It is very accurate when it comes figuring out the type of person you are by how you make day to day decisions through the different tests and questions. I love it, and it actually drives me to want to improve my overall IQ."
4,qumquatitude,"Lots of games, not overly pushy with notifications, and useful test on ADHD, IQ, ACES and more. Unfortunately my favorite game a wordle-like word game has started glitching and giving me the same words two sometimes three times in a row. Started about a month ago. While I do often play a few rounds a night, I certainly haven‚Äôt gone through every five letter word."
5,Dustin Em,"This is really a great way to work through brain training exercises and have fun while doing so. This app provides me with many different activities that allow me to sharpen, as well as increase efficiency in my thinking and skills! Highly recommend!!"
2,Gold_mom85,"I paid for a lifetime subscription which is supposed to have no ads but when I use it, most of the time it keeps showing me all sorts of ads for games, and asking me to get a subscription. I wrote them to ask them to fix it but they haven‚Äôt done anything.  Update: they sent me a response asking me to email their support. I did and still no response to my email after several days."
5,Not Useful0303050507,"Great way to wake up those parts of your brain that have long forgotten how to process certain tasks, information, or problem solving. Love this App. Not to keen on having to pay for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or full access but In the world today literally nothing is free in anymore smh."
5,jacquib32,"I‚Äôm just a couple weeks into using the app a couple times a day and it‚Äôs surprisingly entertaining, challenging and rewarding. Great way to start my day and also better than social media scrolling throughout my work day lol Telling my friends and fam to get Impulse too"
5,Business Major College Student,My days are very busy and so I really enjoy the few minutes of exercises throughout the day. The exercises are fun and helpful. I feel like my brain wakes up and operates a little more efficiently. I look forward to these breaks during the day. After playing I feel mentally refreshed.
5,A great game's friend,"This app is amazing, you get to choose what you wanna workout in and it also allows you to do other things! I am in love with this app and it‚Äôs only been the 2nd day! Another thing I love about it is how it‚Äôs completely free by choice, and even if I want to get premium, I was given 92% off for free!"
1,kindaverygrumpy,"the ads in this app are OUT OF CONTROL. it‚Äôs 1 every 2 mini games or so and upon paying for them to go away (5.99 to permanently remove ads for this game) it only removes them in one mini game. not the whole app which i think is ridiculous. id gladly pay more to remove them from the whole app but to have it specifically for one game is a scam and makes me not want to play, let alone recommend the game to anyone which i was planning to do but the ads are so out of control that it‚Äôs not even worth playing"
5,—Ä–∞–∑–±–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á–∫–∏ –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∞,"Loved the lightbulb sequence game. My brain was happy to play that one. Other games are also pretty neat. Good variety. I‚Äôd purchase the lifetime for 30-40, but there‚Äôs no such a thing. Too bad. I‚Äôm not a subscription person. But it‚Äôs good. If you have money to spare and into these kinds of games, then go for it."
3,Paepaeclark,"They give you a free trial with limited access. That‚Äôs all fine and dandy. The games are fun. But they offer you quizzes that take a little time. When you complete the quizzes you can‚Äôt access your results unless you go premium or pay a flat rate for the results. I found it annoying to even offer them, if you can‚Äôt have your results, on your free trial. Other than that, I enjoyed the app."
5,kuromi_luv,"I actually really like this game,at first I was pretty skeptical because I know pay usually comes with games like this and I don‚Äôt like paying subscriptions,but so far it‚Äôs actually really good,I still get to play games and sharpen my brain!! 10/10 would recommend"
5,roseby_v,"Keeping in real.  This game is impressively great for the brain.  Cognitively it kept me in my toes and challenged me to realize the simple tasks can be forgotten or over looked.  Bring sharp mentally is very important and the game will keep you there  I get bored with many games after a few months of playing just because I don‚Äôt feel challenged; however, I don‚Äôt think this will be a problem playing this one.   Young or Wise all should play.  I may allow my students with Autism play. It may be the simulation they need.   This is a wonderful game. Maybe the challenge I‚Äôve been searching for."
4,cowaroo,"This game is awesome. It helps train my brain everyday with fun and easy,medium,and harder games. So you can graduate to the higher games. A lot of things need premium but you can still play the game. Also you need premium to remove adds and have unlimited hearts. Once you run out of hears, it‚Äôs a few hours till you can play again. Over all k like this game"
5,TheBlackPearl22,"It‚Äôs great. There‚Äôs no other stuff you need to do, all the game is, is puzzles. It‚Äôs a different game every time too, so it doesn‚Äôt get boring. It‚Äôs not like one of those games that claims to strengthen your brain because most the stuff is at least a little challenging and you can see improvement."
1,alypend,"I downloaded this app because the puzzles were fun, but started getting charges at random times even though we were purchasing anything. Now even after canceling and deleting the app we are continuing to be charged. Not sure how to stop this!! Pretty sure this is not a real company.  Update: the developer response is bogus! I did not sign up for the pro plan and they have continued to charge us even after Apple canceled the subscription. This app is a scam."
5,Urotten,"Best new brain teaser app I‚Äôve found out. Even if u just play free versions it‚Äôs till helping improve so much like hand/eye coordination, to memory and the like‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre looking for a game to test yourself or just to improve your brain I would recommend it to anyone to just try it out."
5,FaithyReid,My focus and memory has honestly improved. If you can stick to it for even a week you‚Äôll notice the difference. I actually needed up getting the animal membership because I loved it so much. And all of the games are user friendly whether you‚Äôre tech savvy or not.
3,ikeknight,"First, the exercises and games are excellent and I enjoy doing them. What I do not like is there is always a notification. So I open the app and there‚Äôs a number on the bell, so I click it and then there‚Äôs nothing new there. I find it annoying that there are multiple notifications a day & with the exception of the reminder I set, none of the notifications are for anything."
5,KimItzel,"It‚Äôs a great app for those who like to challenge their brain. You can choose what you would like to use this app for, for example, anxiety problems, improve in mental math or etc. The only thing that I wish was different for us free users is the amount of ads."
5,NicJE223,When there are 3 bins they are too close to the bottom of my screen so I the pause/restart/continue keeps on accidentally being hit. Please resolve.  Edit: They fixed the issue! My rating has been updated. Games are great and addictive. It‚Äôs nice to play a game that‚Äôs actually good for your brain
4,Adirobloxlove!!!,"So,I love this it helped me calm down when I was having trouble with life!It helped me calm down and it helped me ALOT!! Thank you for making this and also if you are bored download this!!! For the game:you should add like games not like these memorize games like fun games! But anyways I‚Äôm going to give this a 4 as a review because it‚Äôs ok but I would have games in this!"
5,Timetogo77,My mom told me about this game and my mom said i couldn‚Äôt get premium tho and when I got on the game I was kinda disappointed because I couldn‚Äôt get premium but with or without premium you can still play a bunch of fun games and there is a free game every day that you would normally have to buy.
5,Jibarp,"I suffered from Covid to the point that I could not focus, read, converse or concentrate.  I‚Äôve worked on these tests and drills for two years now.  I‚Äôm finally feeling as mentally alert, aware and with the ability to process again.  To the point of enjoying my senior years and retirement."
3,BrownieJo2024,I took one of the tests.  Selected the ‚Äòshare results‚Äô option to Facebook.  The post didn‚Äôt share the results.  Instead it just posted a link to the website.  Within a couple minutes FB alerted me they blocked my SHARE because it required someone to open the website before seeing result.  Apparantly that is a no-no on FB.
5,sammu_,"I never write reviews lol, I don‚Äôt normally find these apps legitimately useful. But impulse is great for quick mental breaks and finding out more about how your mind works! It keeps your mind sharp while also being a quick break between study sessions. Would recommend :)"
5,Terrydaktil,My daughter wanted me to try this and I really like it. Completing the daily training gives you a sense of accomplishment and I like that it lets me know how I do compared to my peers. Before this I was constantly playing bingo which was not challenging at all. I think everyone should do this. I‚Äôm 75.
5,Stonie1cannobi,I think the game is amazing set up. It has quick fast pay games so when you only have a short amount of time to get whatever training you can and I see the results already and it helps with my work.
5,Pegster s t,This starts off with pretty basic mind training exercises and gets a little tougher.  It‚Äôs not so tough that you get overwhelmed but comfortably toughens your mind.  I identify myself as being ‚Äústupid ‚Äú when really you need to calm down and focus.  I like testing my mind especially at 60 yrs of age.  üòä
5,TheZayLife,"Great app so far (only 2 days into trial). Had the choice for a $50 lifetime offer that I want but you‚Äôre directing me to a single cta to pay $29/month. Send me the link to get that offer and I‚Äôm down, otherwise you‚Äôre forcing people like me to make a 2nd account."
5,üïäÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏èü§ç,I like this app because it does make you think. It makes you think outside the box with trying to figure out some of the problems. It doesn‚Äôt just give you one type of problem either. It also tests your personality. I like the riddles the best.
2,KMC STUDIO,I was prompted to try a free trial through Instagram.  I signed up and then was charged.  Apparently I had already used the free trial and instead of being prompted of this I was seamlessly enrolled and subsequently charged.  This was deceptive to say the least.  I should have been immediately been notified I‚Äôd already done the trial  and I would have chosen a different - probably a lifetime subscription. Now I will probably never use the app and find another one.
1,Barbieatyanna,"We‚Äôre all guilty of skipping through some minor details when we‚Äôre moving quickly on apps. Its currently April and I just noticed I‚Äôve been getting charged a $6.99 fee literally every single WEEK by this app since January (possibly earlier). I opened the app once and forgot about it.   A monthly charge seems reasonable nowadays for certain apps, but this is a weekly one. I‚Äôm genuinely confused about why...  Reminder to be vigilant with checking on Apple purchases/subscriptions."
5,Iamthestevenrojas,I enjoy this app a lot. I‚Äôm no neurologist but it‚Äôs said that the games played in this app help with brain improvement. I truly believe that it helps sharpen my brain and its functions. I kind of feel like I‚Äôve warmed my brain after utilizing it. Like when you warm up before a sports game.
5,impostor48,These fun games make you relax and feel happy and I really enjoy that and how i got this app was from my dad and it looked really cool and then i asked him ‚Äúhow did you get that game?‚Äù And then he showed me the game and installed it on my phone then i played it for like 2 days and now i like this so.. 5 STARS
5,goyaweezermiller,This app makes me stop during the day and use my BRAIN ‚Ä¶ since retiring from Nursing I felt like I wasn‚Äôt having to think about any task or solving any problems‚Ä¶ I think this app is a great way to start training my brain and using my memory And to keep as sharp as possible!!  Highly recommended
5,Rawbbit,I use impulse every day before bed or early in the opening. Helps me keep my mind in check and I get motivated to move to higher levels. The selection of games is wide and I love that I am able to keep challenging myself daily. My 6 year old also plays with me and he loves it.
5,Old-man-river,"This app really keeps you sharp. You know what they say if you don‚Äôt use it you‚Äôll lost it and that not what anyone would want. The game reminds you to play and it‚Äôs fun you never know what‚Äôs next. Like the math what comes first ( ) ,left to right,divide  or times‚Ä¶. And doing homework with the grandkids. Love it."
5,"Committee Member, Pastor","Unlike other apps, which claim to help your mind by playing a few minutes each day, this app has specific exercises and let you know the way in which they help different parts of the brain. So it is fun and yet truly helpful get this app."
5,Tati529,"I‚Äôve been looking for a brain training app for some time now and looks like I finally found it! The short quiz allowed me to pick the areas of development I want, and the games are entertaining. I‚Äôm looking forward to completing some of their assessments to learn more about myself."
5,Navy grape,"I bout the app a few days ago and have been working through all the profile tests, games and daily tests and I am enjoying it more than I expected, as a veteran who has a TBI and memory issues this has helped me see where I stand and how to improve."
5,That Random Refrigerator,"I‚Äôve used Impulse for about a year now and it has helped me tremendously. I sleep better and longer, I feel more energized, and I feel more relaxed. The games are fun too! Personally, my favorite game is the Word Find. Overall, I feel like a better and more relaxed person. Thanks Impulse."
1,xxpoohhoneyxx,"I do love this app and play it every night, however, it just recently started randomly opening my web browser with a pop up virus page. Something about a ‚Äúfree gift‚Äù. I tried reporting it but unfortunately the app doesn‚Äôt allow you to report things. So I hope to get a response from this review. My app was updated 2 days ago and it currently up to date. But surely something needs to be fixed because I‚Äôve had this app for a while and it never used to do this."
5,bacarrie,"Impulse is great for improving speed, accuracy, knowledge, and memory. I enjoy all activities including the timed exercises as well as games with unlimited time allotted. I enjoyed the personality, IQ, ADHD, and other tests and reports to teach me about myself. It doesn‚Äôt get old and continues to challenge me every time."
5,jayce1414,I like seeing where I rate in relationship to other players in my age range. There is a good variety of different games so I can focus on the ones I enjoy the most. I skip a few completely but of course those are the ones I really should get proficient in.
5,NancyofRockhaven,"I have only been using this app for a few days, but I have to tell you, I am excited! I can see how this experience will certainly improve my thinking and brain power if I use it faithfully for the next year. It‚Äôs like I am starting a new adventure!"
3,XoXnothappyXoX,"I know that the purpose of this app is to train your brain.  However, sometimes I don‚Äôt want to do that and simply wish to play to pass time.  I don‚Äôt want to be compared and timed every time I play.  If I want to play to relax, for me, getting timed is not it.  Had it had an option to turn off ‚Äútimed‚Äù mode, I would have bought the legacy. It is unfortunate, I did enjoy the games I played."
4,bkayles,Don‚Äôt download the app unless willing to pay for just about everything. Ads will swamp you as well. If you‚Äôre looking for some small brain activities for 10 minutes a day then this is a good app. But don‚Äôt think you can take any of the tests and get any results. You must pay for them
4,Poslandt,"As someone who likes doing puzzles and quick brain training exercises, this app is pretty good. The puzzles aren‚Äôt an intellectual challenge, but forcing yourself to work through them quickly adds an adequate challenge. The ads are annoying, but definitely a good way to pass time and engage your mind a little bit."
5,MrsMorton18,Helps me wake up in the morning better than my coffee does it challenges my brain just enough to activate my thoughts on the morning and also calms me down when I‚Äôm upset I‚Äôve also learned a lot about myself through the tests they provide love love love this app
5,titpix,"I love the game for myself. Anytime I forget my book at home I always pick it up for some brain games. Also, my six-year-old loves games on the phone, and I don't feel as bad turning this app over to her. It fees positive and not like brain rot. Thanks guys! Also no ads is amazing!"
5,Michael96533,You might as well stay sharp while on your phone. There are activities that are a waste of time and tend to slow your mind down. The brain training games as least bring a small challenge and increase your attention span.
5,NONei11,"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually helping my brain to get better, but it‚Äôs not doing any harm and it‚Äôs fun. I did end up buying the one time subscription purchase because it‚Äôs just so much cheaper, and usually I don‚Äôt subscribe to anything so I guess you could say they got me hooked lol."
5,Lynster1982,"The games are clever and easy to learn. I def feel more alert and focused after playing a couple of games. I also like that it gives you a comparison score at the end just to act as a benchmark for improvements over time (e.g., performed better than X% of people your age)."
5,NinaMS718,It‚Äôs worth to take a few moments and just play. It‚Äôs a good way to wake up the mind in the morning and relaxes and distracts the mind from a stressful day. You will walk away with a smile on your face and that‚Äôs because you found a game that provides a balance.
5,1122boyer,I‚Äôm hoping this helps with my reconnecting my brain function.    I‚Äôve heard great things about this type of Neuro feedback and am hopeful this helps with the issues I still struggle with.  So far I‚Äôm enjoying this app.  It‚Äôs only been 2 days.  But I think I‚Äôll like it going forward
5,deyfwizzie630,My review is 5 stars because I find impulse a great way to use ur brain and train it with anything u struggle with (mine would be memory) sometimes my brain short circuits and forgets things so this app is helping and training my brain to not forget as much. So thank u to the creators of this app I love it sm it‚Äôs awesome!!! üòä
5,*Linsay*,I really like this app because it only takes a couple minutes a day and the games are fun. They make you think which is the point but I feel the benefits are quicker with this app compared to others I have played.
4,Real.Life.Barbi,"This app holds my attention because I control how quickly I can do each game. It‚Äôs really well-balanced with simple concepts and stimulating visuals, keeping you engaged. The challenges follow suit. The combination of these factors really allows you to enjoy these mini brain workouts."
5,Pella della the madella,"Truly one of the best apps I have downloaded. These skill sharpening mini games not only improve your abilities but makes it fun at the same time, got an extra 10 min to spare or need help getting your thoughts in a flow just open the app and work those  neurons. 10/10"
5,yuliya.k21,"Mental health is becoming a fundamental thing nowadays. Struggling with anxiety and daily multitasking routine increases the level of depression and deprives our productivity. So mental self care and its training are our life saviors. I believe, ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù is a beautiful solution to meet my goal to stay sharp and wise! Highly recommend it!"
5,Hxylxx99,"Since I started playing these brain games, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve had a little longer attention span, little better memory, and it‚Äôs something I can do to distract my mind if I wanted to escape in any way. If you want to have fun and learn something from it, I highly suggest this app."
5,Vilhaknss,"To be honest I downloaded it out of curiosity. As I started to play it was actually fun. This game is probably a good addition to your phone for times of waiting, boredom or even just to work your brain. Something different from just a ‚Äúmindless‚Äù game."
5,manifestazn,"Love this app! Really makes you brainstorm an helps me to focus and solve each level. Recommend this game/app to anyone who love problem solving. Best parts is, you can apply this training in your daily life. This should be something that should be given to kids in school. My kid will be on this app daily."
5,merrick98,Doing these small little exercises has already improved my memory and thought process within the course of a week. The games are fun and don‚Äôt take up a ton of time - definitely going to continue exercising my brain with Impluse!
3,ushhxhdhgejdbidb,I saw an ad for impulse on Tik Tok and I thought why not try it out. Impulse asked me questions on what kind of performance and skill levels I was trying to raise using the app and that was amazing. After I finished the questions it brought me to a payment area but I just pressed the X. I looked at my plan and I can only have a week of training and the rest is premium so if it was free I would like it more but overall it‚Äôs a cool and fun app.
5,changemynumber,"I loved ALLL the games I played. Some were very challenging and some were very light on the mind. It was so relaxing and time consuming. It actually makes me feel like I‚Äôm working my cognitive skills, reading skills, and basic math! I really wish I could of continued using the app. Really a shame that it‚Äôs a weekly subscription."
5,AL Services,All the games in one app! Get your daily challenges in and then pick between your favorite games to have fun and unwind. You can also do the ‚Äòquiz‚Äô games to learn more about yourself! I also love that it gives ratings right when you finish a game!
3,SibelleGh,"Most apps mentions to the consumer that there will be a free trial for certain days before they download the app. But this is not the case. It was surprising to be locked out after day 3! Also, other similar apps allows limited daily workouts for those who don‚Äôt wish to go premium. They would still have access to several games daily but not the privilege to access all games.. The quality and diversity of games is great!"
5,Skeeter77niter,"I love the games on this app; I‚Äôve been wanting to play these games all day long, but had to wait and that was hard. I am so excited about how my brain is going to work so much more efficiently; I definitely believe this will happen with these brain games. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ"
5,Bugball31,I love this app specifically because it gives me the opportunity to strengthen my mental health and reinforce traits already present. Everyone loves a challenge and this style of gameplay is surprisingly fun and hard to stop playing once started.   This app is a must-have if sharpening your mental acuity is important to you.
5,Nikefiend11,"A good mix of variety and simple games/tests to keep your brain sharp and focused. Also if you get turned off by the paywall when you sign up, you can opt out for a basic experience and have a chance to spin for a cheaper annual price. Just fyi for those on a budget."
5,BrightNeonLights,"I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like it but after purchasing this app, I‚Äôm actually enjoying the benefits of it. I do feel like I‚Äôve become more focused and I actually look forward to playing my daily games and then some."
5,Rabeem,"Please fix the bug in the candy sort game. It lags after every level, and sometimes locks up my phone. I end up just closing the app in order to move on to each level. Edit: it works well now. Thanks!"
5,saacster,These games are actually pretty entertaining when I‚Äôm bored and to think I‚Äôm strengthening my brain makes me feel productive. I‚Äôve always wondered where I was when it came to brain capacity and it tells you how you compare to others on that difficulty.
5,Suiskdbdbisjeneidj,I like how the app gives you games to play and I also like how it gives you a small friendly reminder that adds are skipable and how it shows you the icons and gives you a reason why there are adds
5,Madismiley,I love this app! I‚Äôve never bought a subscription to a game before but I decided to try because I do want to work my brain. I‚Äôm so glad I did! The games are so fun it doesn‚Äôt even feel like work. Plus the personality quizzes are so informative. I would absolutely recommend!
4,yyghuiiu,"I just play the free games, and they are fun and a good puzzles to do. There are many puzzles to do on the app, and I enjoy doing them. But the one thing for me are the ads. There are so many! I understand that they need them, but it‚Äôs practically every level of a puzzle. But other than that, it‚Äôs worth a download."
5,Krazy_kolors,It‚Äôs everything it‚Äôs advertised to be. The games serve as brain teasers to exercise your brain. The best part is that the games are mixed up and there are a lot to choose from to stop it being monotonous and it only takes a few minutes out of your day
5,Khector78,I have only done two days of training but so far I am really enjoying it. Give it a try   Update: I love this app it‚Äôs not only challenging but interesting as well. Plus the test are enlightening and pretty accurate. This app hasn‚Äôt disappointed me and I use it everyday.
2,bojibabygirl,"I LOVE this app! And used it faithfully every day‚Ä¶multiple times a day. However when I had to do a n iPhone restart, I found that although it shows a profile, it does not actually save your progress. In other words, it isn‚Äôt let you actually set up a profile with your name, email, etc. You don‚Äôt have the option of signing in or out. So if the app is deleted, you start back at the beginning.  Bummer."
5,Juanky179513,"This game is so much fun. It helps me get that jumpstart in the brain to start it all off with good concentration and focus. It tells me things i want to know about myself like for example my IQ level, my type of thinking if im more right than left and more. I highly recommend it."
2,Ismarixo,"Everything you do on this app costs more and more money and it‚Äôs not advertised it would be this way. I don‚Äôt think the mini games are bad but when you ask me to buy something every time I get finished with a quiz or mini game it gets really annoying. Will continue to to do the daily mini games for free, (if I can even do that) but I will not be shelling money out for something that I could just look up."
5,E T.h.R.e.E,It really helps me wind down and honestly stay focused. Probably one of the best games for someone that has ADD/ADHD. By stimulating the brain enough that is has enough time to not only get enable but also establish into an environment that the brain finds its most soothing place to grow on a very well platform for fundamental growth.
5,claraB12345.,"My family has Alzheimer‚Äôs and I want to do everything I can to keep my brain healthy. These are quick and quite relaxing actually. They provide enough challenge to make you think, but you feel like you‚Äôre playing a game!"
4,TJayPoling,"I actually do really enjoy this app, but I already pay for enough things in my life, that I don‚Äôt care to add another one to that list. I‚Äôd probably play around on this app daily if it was free‚Ä¶ however it isn‚Äôt. So when my trial ends tomorrow, I‚Äôll be deleting it. Unless the developers want to work out an advertising deal with me! ;)"
5,Nickname 4 you,"With the games you can see why they give them to you, there is certain free games but not all are free, which is fine for me.  They give you new games every day, but you only get three (which is also fine for me).  It‚Äôs I really cool app, you should try it out."
5,BlackPeaceMaker,I appreciate that the games are quick and easy and the app regularly reminds you throughout the day to take a break and work out your brain for just a bit. If you are someone like me who gets overstimulated or bogged down with work in life this is a fun reliever for your mind.
5,Al's diner,Excellent app. Just wanted to give it a few days of use before I gave a more extensive review. I chose this app because my sister said I have memory issues (I know this is because of day to day stress). This app is helping me train my attention to things a little more carefully.
5,this isn't yours to change,"If you‚Äôre looking at your phone screen each day, you might as well improve your brain function. Just a few minutes a day with fun, engaging games is all it takes. I‚Äôm enjoying myself immensely."
5,Shockakahn,I always feel like my brain is sharper after practicing with impulse. My responses are quicker and I find my brain retrieving info quicker. It's a valuable tool for those who have to make a lot of quick decisions at work or who need to gather their thoughts for insightful discussions and presentations.
5,Exerciseman,"Really good app. It can really help people‚Äôs brain no matter what disorder you have. It‚Äôs like how you‚Äôre tested in school.. I wish I downloaded way sooner, long ago and I‚Äôm 34.. This is what kids need to be doing instead of other stuff on their phones. I needed this when I was in high school at least.."
5,Wspanicgirl,"Love the challenges and the pace off these games! It is a much better use of my time that would otherwise be wasted getting sidetracked going down a scrolling rabbit hole of internet brain numbing nonsense. Thanks for encouraging good screen-time with fun games do t bombard me with pop ups, and spam!"
1,blackpink_lisa,"I completed a day worth of tasks and it have a me a prize that was a 92% or 98% discount off premium plan. It said it would be $0.58/week so I went ahead and bought it. I realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to be using the app much so I decided to cancel my subscription and saw that it charged me for the whole year. I feel scammed after it told me that it would be less than a dollar per week and instead of getting charged weekly, they charged me for the whole year which was almost $30"
5,cassidy bolster,Honestly at this point in the game I‚Äôve been playing for about a week yes there are quite a few adds but overall I love all the games it has and the tests it is so fun for me and with my bad memory I like to play those ones and I love math so I‚Äôm lucky they have math things also.
5,KayanaBloodrayne,I believe that it‚Äôs important to distance yourself from traditional games that do nothing to stimulate your mind  and this creates interesting and engaging mind games that really makes you think in a good way rather than the normal societal pressure and stressful thoughts.
5,Jackiefroberg65,"Loving the a lot test and quiz‚Äôs to keep my mind a little better on the focus I‚Äôm not usually on this kind of apps but I think I‚Äôm definitely paying the $27 for the whole yr to get the progress reports and other stuff u let‚Äôs u know the process of quiz‚Äôs the games , math a bunch of different stuff"
5,MarikeSwart,"A better way to entertain your brain versus mindless scrolling through social media feeds. Sometimes you just need to shut off a bit, or focus on something outside of the ordinary day to day responsibilities. It relaxes me, and is beneficial for brain training at the same time."
5,Skirken,"It has a wide variety of test/puzzles. It‚Äôs not too expensive. And has daily exercise plan. I really feel like it will be helpful in improving/exercising my cognitive functioning. If you want to improve your cognitive functioning in a fun, helpful way, this is the tool for you."
5,Pescador3347,"I‚Äôve tried several ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù and as a 57 year old that would like to keep my brain sharp, this has been the best app I‚Äôve found, to date.  Instead of the same old repetitive game, playing over and over, this game takes you through different stages, focusing on several different factions of the brain that decrease with age.  It‚Äôs far more entertaining and effective than just doing the daily newspaper crossword or ‚Äúlogic puzzles‚Äù.  If you are starting to ‚Äúage‚Äù or just want to keep your brain sharp, I‚Äôd highly recommend downloading this app and putting it to use!"
3,Landon Rob. Martin,"I got this app not only to be sharpen my brain, but also to relax and help me wind down a bit. But these ads cause so much stress. After every single level I always have this feeling that an ad will pop up and it‚Äôs the suspension that stresses me out a bit. Great app, but you‚Äôve got enough money. At this point you‚Äôre just milking it. Slow down with the ads please."
5,Qcooltiger,It‚Äôs entertaining and it is also educational. I feel more confinement at school and smarter. It‚Äôs great brain work out. I would suggest anyone get it since you can use it for free. But it‚Äôs even better if you pay the subscription. So don‚Äôt hesitate get it now.
5,grandma crash,After suffering with long covid I was searching for help to improve my cognitive function.  Impulse is one of the tools I use daily.  I can measure my progress and see where I need extra help.  I really have enjoyed this app and have referred many friends and associate to it.
5,Azurus Panthaleos,"This app has plenty of diverse games capable of stimulating any type of person‚Äôs brain. It also allows for self discovery through many quality personality tests. The colorful and vibrant designs are stimulating and never allow the user to be bored. Five stars, would recommend."
1,Anonymous20241115,"Way more expensive and that too its yearly and not lifetime. Ads are soo frequent and takes lot of time even with skip ad, which shows how desperate they are in pushing the customer in buying the subscription. Weekly and yearly subscription is rip off.   If you are ready to spend 30$ yearly or 7$ weekly then this app is for you. Else one should have patience to use the app with ads which are too frequent and takes time to skip ads."
5,LinRussRn,"When you start out, there is a learning curve. As you continue the program, you feel the improvement and then you can also see the report and see the improvement. Great mental workout."
5,Jude999üòÄ,"I purchased this app for a year, and I‚Äôve been using it regularly. Starting today it immediately crashes after opening‚Äîit immediately closes. Is there a fix for this?"
5,stephbmann,With my mom suffering from dementia and seeing that disease first hand I am always playing games and trying to do things that they have found to help the brain exercise. I appreciate this technology and have enjoyed playing and hopefully strengthens my cognitive parts of my brain.
4,broknsoles,I spend time playing video games or reading books. I have spent time playing word games or puzzle games but found myself swiftly bored with the variety. It is nice to have an app that does not waste time trying to sell me other things instead of the focus of the app itself.
5,Gj√ºdith,"I like the games in the app. It‚Äôs simple and quick to use , especially when you only have a few minutes to distract yourself from something . Helps me refocus . Games are simple, yet engaging . It sometimes wants me to continue playing more."
5,Renay4567,"Look forward to training everyday and enjoying the games! Especially the relax games before going to bed, helps shut my mind off and enables me to actually fall asleep faster. Started 2 months ago, haven‚Äôt missed a day as I don‚Äôt want to break my streak!!!"
5,CathiGg,I really like the variety of training Impulse has to offer. It doesn‚Äôt get boring like other apps I have tried. I also like the detailed feedback it gives. It really helps me to better track my deficits and areas of improvement.
5,aacclx,"I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing these games in my free time, better than scrolling social media aimlessly. But doesn‚Äôt take too much time to complete the tasks. Feels like little achievements that just boost your mood and exercise your brain :)"
1,Alma San,"Just another money hungry app. I did the free trial, after 3 days I‚Äôll be charged if not canceled and they want me to sign up for another weekly payment to get my results.. So first use of the app there‚Äôs TWO different paywalls. The business and your app will probably fail. I don‚Äôt know who would be okay paying for this app. You can‚Äôt advertise something and then force people to pay two times to do what you advertised would be possible.  I knew it‚Äôd be a scam like this when I saw the advertisement."
5,"jjiio,makoakwjejdidjfhf","I never imagined that this type of program could work for me. However, after a couple of weeks I really noticed a change In my cognition and memory for the better! I‚Äôm having to rely less and less on Siri!!"
5,Koala woman üë©üèª,"I am smarter already, and I have only use it for three days. it is fun in entertaining for kids, but it is still challenging for adults. no matter if you were a kid trying to get smarter or an adult just wanting to train your brain. I recommend this game for anyone."
5,djfvfjfo,üíØThis game is so fun and can help improve mental math and attention. I am a n 7th grade and downloaded this fun game that really helps for learning mental math and helps you get improve over time. If you are looking for improvements you n Math u should definitely download this! üëçüíó Thank you!!!
5,Startanaa,"I have frequent panic attacks and severe anxiety, I got this app and was a little ashamed that when it comes to health and benefit we always have to pay for something, like a subscription. But overall all the free things are helpful. Also very calming and distracting when feeling symptoms of panic."
5,backsideof40,I love this app! It a great way to exercise your grey matter improve functions. It never feels like work and I love the stats u get so you can see how much you improve and compare to others. At first I thought it was a little pricey but it‚Äôs definitely worth it.
2,pamu72,"Cool games, but some are not able to be completed without the ‚Äòextra tools‚Äô so you must watch an advertisement to get the extra tool to complete the level. There are already huge ads between games (30-60s), this was just an extra one (60-75s). I‚Äôm actually going to delete this app because of that. You spend more time watching ads then playing the games‚Ä¶ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,Albyz88,"This app is really cool. It was an impulse purchase haha. But I love that it has various brain tests, along with a multitude of brain games! I've purchased something like this before but it felt more like a chore than fun. This is comprised of really short and fun games, all very different, that keep it really interesting!"
5,me892630-,"I struggle with focusing on text over a light background, and it would be really nice and convenient to have an option for a black background and white text, and maybe a customizable option featured in the subscription."
5,mrmcdoned,"Impulse is really helpful for things like paying attention. Paying attention is something i don't necessarily struggle with often but impulse helped me improve. Main reasons i love impulse is: the games are fun, it helps improve needed skills, the ads aren‚Äôt terrible  I would recommend!!"
5,LyLy Ward,I suffer from a lot of different mental Illness‚Äô and this has helped me think quicker and prioritize what‚Äôs important and not in what I think. It keeps my brain thinking and testing myself to improve. It‚Äôs extremely relaxing and helps a lot mentally in a healthy way. It boosts my self esteem too lol.
5,Jsjajan182847,"I enjoy the various games, puzzles, and tests that engage the brain and eyes. Focus, Memory, and quick & creative thinking are challenged. I enjoy this more than other mindless games when I have a few minutes. A couple of these in the morning with coffee to get the brain out of bed."
5,dako1015,"Way better than I thought it was going to be. I‚Äôm really impressed with the variety of test,puzzles,games, and etc. I just got the 6.99 week to try it out and starting to think its definitely worth the annual subscription!!!"
5,James970,The impulse brain training app is a great way to improve my working memory and exercise my mind. It‚Äôs fun and easy and the benefits are very good. I have some experience with brain fogs and mental adversity and this is a good app to help when I get distracted by a large task at work or just need a break from overthinking.
5,sundarmd2000,"You won‚Äôt be disappointed! That‚Äôs for sure.  Excellent triaging of a customized goal set for you whether it pertain to fine calculations, simple to complex problem solving, and even hand eye coordination in relation to puzzle solving while looking at time management. ‚Äònuff said!!!"
5,lotus de loca,"Been using it a month and I feel like I have less memory episodes where I forget people , words and sentences as I speak them some days are worse than others. I am getting quicker and farther on each game each day"
5,LaneTheSalesGuy,After leaving school I don‚Äôt feel my mind is challenged a lot in various ways with most days being repetitive and tedious work. This allows me to keep my brain sharp and try to improve my reaction time as well as my reasonable thinking skills.
5,hazelorosco,This game is so awesome because If you are colorblind (I am not colorblind) it gives you the option to make the screen like you need it. It also is Really intertaining because you don‚Äôt need wifi and you don‚Äôt have to wasn‚Äôt the next day to play games.
5,Kellie_Baumgartner,This app is so much fun. I downloaded it for one game and I had no idea all the cool challenges it actually had. My favorite part is the random games it gives you but also the fact it ranks you against others to let you know where you stand. Want a challenge get this app!
5,JustDupes,"I was concerned that my memory was declining so I did some research on ways to help. One of those is brain games for focus, clarity, quick decision making and critical thinking. I no longer feel foggy brain or embarrassed that I can‚Äôt find the words to say when I need them. Very useful app!"
5,CravenTaken,"Honestly playing these game brought a self awareness of when I‚Äôm able to do my best and when I freeze up or pause during an exercise, overall it‚Äôs fun and I hope I‚Äôm able to build my self and not burst through everything thinking I don‚Äôt need it. üò£üòñü§≠ü§´"
5,DylanBuys,I love the app it‚Äôs been very entertaining and beneficial for me over the past few weeks. My problem with it is there is no way for me to transfer my progress to my iPad. Nor is there a version made for the iPad. I would love if these two issues were fixed!
5,TrippnSac,"Yo yo yo just buy the lifetime subscription. It‚Äôs 50 bucks and you can just play whenever you want.   Not really sure if this app is worth anything because I just started playing; I have a two day streak. However, the games I‚Äôve played are cool and the test seem informative"
5,csdbiem,"I‚Äôm not sure about the training part since I‚Äôve only had it for one day, but the games are fun and quite different from any others I play.  It‚Äôs nice to have the variety in one game and the games make you think and will no doubt get more challenging."
5,Jyfjgdhyf,So I love this game and helping train my brain but I have suggestions most of my family is autistic so I always wondered if I was autistic my suggestion is take some Add test and autism test or any other disorder and put it there it would help. After all that no complaints and love the app
5,LindaN112,"I‚Äôve only been playing for one day, so it‚Äôs a little early for a review. So far, that‚Äôs the only thing I don‚Äôt like about this game. If they had waited until I started to see results to ask for a review, the review would have actually been meaningful."
5,Gr8stairbldr,"Well, it‚Äôs only day two of the app. I really enjoy it. Played it for over an hour last night. I thought it was extremely more entertaining than watching TV. I look forward to the daily challenges and we‚Äôll see how it goes."
5,hrcXVIII,"I‚Äôve only been using this app a few days, so far though it‚Äôs really entertaining. This app also seems to have several games packed into to it that are mini-games within other games. I‚Äôve already suggested this one to friends."
4,Snark8va,So far it seems easy but apparently I am too slow in the process so I am not really sure how I feel about this. I can see the skill building that the program is working towards and for that reason I am going to continue working on my own skills through this program.
5,Jiggle-ton,"I‚Äôve only been playing for an hour, but I feel that Impulse does an amazing job at strengthening the brain, with accurate tests and puzzles that really do help. I would seriously recommend this app to anyone looking to challenge this brain and/or improve their mind."
5,tatararatatata,"I love that it has so many options. Ones for when you just want to play without a purpose, ones for remembering those maths that you don‚Äôt do since school was over, vocabulary, memory increasing, test way more fun that the cosmopolitannnnn Anyway, I love it"
5,k ri s h,I love this app it helps my brain get the exercise it needs to get better.  I had a stroke 2years ago and still have cognitive issues and other issues that are causing my life to be a little challenging.  Impulse really helps me to keep going forward with my mental recovery
1,mrsjuliaru,"Downloaded this 3 days ago, started a 7 day free trial (and then it‚Äôs $6,99) to see how I like the app. Today In the morning  I took an 84 question personality test which took me a good minute, only after I answered ALL the questions they happened to let me know I had to pay extra to find out the results. I was frustrated and removed the app immediately, as soon as I cancelled a free trial subscription. Meanwhile I‚Äôm getting the apple bill from them for $7,64 !! Return my money!!"
5,Tray09198,I usually have a difficult time starting a routine when it comes to stuff like this but I have found that this is a simple and effective app when it comes to reminders and focusing me on my goals for the day.
5,Brittney831,Unfortunately I have to cancel. I play so much hated having to pay $30 for a subscription. Soooo worth it. After the year it‚Äôs charging $7 a week. Can‚Äôt figure out how to change my subscription. So I‚Äôm having to cancel it. The games and tests are amazing. This app is amazing.
5,original-bettyknows,Impulse has been a pleasant experience. It‚Äôs not intrusive on your phone with notification overload. The games are interesting and results descriptive. There‚Äôs also a Mental Journal portion of the app that I‚Äôve been exploring. It‚Äôs a series of tests to test your IQ. This is a fun daily app and esthetically pleasing and user friendly.
5,tttvtefcf vrhg,"Impulse is a great app. I never thought it was so good but then I figured out how fun it was after just my first three games, after that I got 92% of of my subscription and it made me really want to keep playing, if you keep playing you will improve your memory, yput mental math, etc‚Ä¶."
5,BeccaBradley1984,"I have an attention span of a goldfish and have always struggled with logical thinking (maths was a huge issue for me both at school and as an adult). This app is amazing! It‚Äôs helped me learn to concentrate and focus without getting distracted and my logic, problem solving and maths is really coming along well with the help of this app."
5,ZeeCov,"This is a great app that has really helped me with my cognitive functions. I have one question though, I have completed all 188 puzzles and wanted to know if there was a way to either unlock more or reset them so that I could go through them again?"
3,Djsizjo,The idea of this app is great but there can be some tweaks first off I wanted to take an IQ test and it took me a while and when I finished it didn‚Äôt let me see my results unless I got premium so they basically wasted 15 minutes of my time and if you don‚Äôt have premium you can‚Äôt rly play like any of the games accept for like a few out of like a hundred üòï
5,harrisonsma,"Feels so good to be working these challenging games, stimulating my brain instead of just mindlessly scrolling! As a nursing mom who has to sit for long periods of time this just FEELS so good!! I feel sharper, refreshed, and relaxed after playing!! Love love love! Do yourself a favor & get on it! Sending to all my family & friends"
3,devilish raisin,I really like the games and I think they do really improve like the brain but the only thing are the ads and the massive pay walls because it‚Äôs like really expensive and like I understand but also they have like it it‚Äôs way too expensive and it‚Äôs not very accessible so inspect expensive for a subscription but I I‚Äôm really glad that there are still free things
1,Pdubble12,I used to love this app. But you took away the days played and that was a point of pride for me. Also changed the number of games required to play each day. I‚Äôm very sad. I do not like new version at all. I won‚Äôt be using as often any longer. Anyway to go back? Apparently this was changed to become a money maker now with ads and premium. I am uninstalling this as the changes ruined this app for me that I played consistent for the past year plus.
5,Mellojk,I really like the games a lot. It‚Äôs really a good challenge for I‚Äôm 50 years old and I wanna stay sharp and I like the times tables the patterns and all of them really. My only complaint would be some of the directions are hard to understand  but two thumbs up
5,KGardin,"The games are simple and fun, but also harder than expected.  It‚Äôs nice to see the score improvements from session to session.  I have a decline in my score when I don‚Äôt use the app for a while (months); that is a good reminder for me to do it daily."
5,GABBI BLM,Im about 5 minutes in and i love it i like that it tells you how personal your experience is and where you fall amongst other peers to know where you need to improve even if you are super above average meaning you can improve in other aspects to learn to be more relatable
5,Blessed Child of God#2,"I first found out about the app from my sister. Dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in our family line on all sides, so she decided to start to reverse as much as she could. I played her app and loved it, so I downloaded it and loved it ever since. The app makes me think and helps my cognitive growth."
4,NYAH_luvsimpulse,This app is Great I saw it in a TikTok add.  The app helps you understand more about yourself. When I downloaded this game I took the ADHD test and they gave me my results back and they were very much true. This app is great for people with anxiety or have mental disabilities because it helps them understand who they are and that they are for sure smart. 5 stars‚≠êÔ∏èüåü
3,DragonCityLover1,"I played the games and they seem fun but it seems like such a money grab. You cant do the tests and see a result without having to pay 5$ or the whole subscription, I might just be a cheapskate but I'm not paying at all, even if it is 28$ a year. Like I said the games are fun and challenging but the fact that you cant see the test results without paying is a little infuriating."
5,TwistedTrashPunk,"I was pretty skeptical if this training would be worth the cost or time, but I‚Äôm seeing results rather quickly. I cannot always make the same time for it each day, though the reminders seem helpful."
2,DaniWlkr,"I downloaded the app because I thought it looked interesting. The first couple of games were alright. I thought it would be a good brain exercise. It was. But I felt it was a little ‚Äútoo‚Äù redundant. I canceled my subscription on the third day. Two days later, I was charged $6.99. After going round and round with Apple support, I decided to just pay it and cancel again. The game was so-so, but definitely not worth what they charge for it."
5,HylianNineTails,"Im glad I found this app! It has fun brain games and there seems to be always something new instead of the same game. Unlike other apps, due to repetition, I get bored and tired of them and usually Uninstall. This app also calms me down when I‚Äôm on my little ADHD spiral."
5,suxhahsuxj,I really like the app for one it can help with remembering stuff like in math and that‚Äôs one of ny hardest subjects but in general I really like this app because to me it is peaceful and really calming for me it also helps my mind to feel good throughout the day I‚Äôve had this app for three days and it really is enjoyable
5,G_lucid,This app is amazing so far and im really enjoying the daily workouts for my brain. It really feels like im increasing the efficiency of my mind in various ways. Its like putting your brain through a yoga class. Slowly building strength and balance over time as well as increasing your understanding of its functions.
1,mmu193,"Came up as an ad on another app, and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. CANNOT EVEN TRY OUT THE TESTS WITHOUT AGREEING TO PAY FOR MEMBERSHIP. To make it worse, when I found out there was no way to access the results without paying, and I tried to exit, they proceeded to bombard me with ‚Äúare you sure‚Äù messages, attempting to get me to access the results of the one test for a ‚ÄúOne time fee of 4.99‚Äù  How cheap can you be? I was hoping this app would help me with my mental health, but it has only made me more frustrated. This is terrible."
5,kimberlyselden,I have several other of the brain learning apps and they‚Äôre all very similar. Impulses platform is a completely different experience. I am having a lot of fun doing the different tests and practicing every day! Thank you for coming up with something differentüòä
5,Volleyball lover14,"I really like being able to go through the processes in my head without a clock ticking. For me personally, this is much more satisfying and I find myself really thinking things through instead of just tapping a random answer to beat the clock."
5,leahwthemooniconpic,"This app‚Äôs games are faster than other ‚Äúbrain workout‚Äù apps I have tried, but no less helpful in getting my mind going for the day!  I especially like the one line drawings, I could do those for hours lol!  Definitely worth checking out!"
2,Vandaling,This game is riddled with ads. You can‚Äôt play two levels without an ad. When you take the tests it makes you decline purchasing it like 3 times and if you click the notification portion to get rid of the notification you‚Äôre right back at the results to have to decline buying the report again 3 times. It has potential but doesn‚Äôt take into account adhd brains and doesn‚Äôt seem to have a timeframe for a game to end.
5,cftxtxotccy,It‚Äôs really great little Overpriced I‚Äôd say but worth it with as much as it gives as long as you buy the onetime charge which it‚Äôs ridiculous the price but you can do the 3 day trial try everything out and you decide if it‚Äôs worth it for you or your kid or not
1,Glorya12,"I downloaded this cause I had previously saw an advertisement in a game I played. I‚Äôve seen other reviews on this specific app, however I downloaded it for probably 10 minutes played the games and all that the ads kept popping up and it was really annoying anyways. I‚Äôve never seen an app slow my phone down and glitch so bad it lagged and wouldn‚Äôt let me open other apps. I ended up deleting it and a few minutes after it reinstalled and messed my phone up"
5,ughhello728927849208488392,i personally have a brain condition were my brain processes things differently than the average person  it has affected my life inside school math is a daily struggle and being able to focus on one thing at one time is equal to a heart attack for me i have seen real results with Impulsive and its low-key really fun
5,Homegirlmarz,"I absolutely love the challenge of the games and better yet, the look of the app is very nice and sophisticated. Every day there are different games and makes it much more exciting. After completing your daily dose of games you still have the option to play more if you wished to. Definitely recommend."
5,Bhasvant,"Only after one day of use I saw the difference immediately. My alertness improved, focus and determination. I feel it is definitely a brain workout. I‚Äôm gonna keep using it and see how far my brain can go!"
3,Mind numbing fun,"Except for the word games I‚Äôm doing really well! And to be honest words are my issue! So I‚Äôm hoping this app helps me change that. I‚Äôm a 51 yr old woman; partying in my 20‚Äôs and perimenopause are taking their toll on my brain, (kids, don‚Äôt do drugs!) I often cannot recall words or easy math problems‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only on day 3, I‚Äôll update if I see change, as of right now 3 stars because it is enjoyable."
4,Avocadoü•ëü•ëü•ëü•ëü•ëü•ëü•ëü•ë,This app is amazing!!! There is nothing wrong with it!! Sooo why did I give it 4 stars?? Because you don‚Äôt get those ‚Äú35 fun games‚Äù. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM!!!!I don‚Äôt want to pay for an app. I got this game because I thought I would be getting fun brain games. Other than this issue this app is absolutely amazing and I definitely recommend this üòÅüôÉ
5,cl needs more filtering,"I look forward into coming daily to my space where I can concentrate on getting challenged by impulse. I think it‚Äôs an excellent application, and I highly recommend it to everyone including my friends."
5,ElizabethSheehan0207,I just started playing this game to improve my brain health. I didn‚Äôt think it would actually be so fun! You forget you‚Äôre training to sharpen your mental acuity. I‚Äôve noticed already how it‚Äôs helped me lengthen my attention span and think critically. Highly recommend!
5,fdgsl,"I just started this program and have found it both challenging and fun. I,of course, need to see how the challenges progress and how it holds my attention. I am certainly hoping to keep my mind both fresh and agile as the years go by."
5,WildAlaskaWoman,"I love Impulse. It‚Äôs not only challenging, but very informative, too. The various ‚Äútype‚Äù tests have helped me to understand why some tasks are difficult for me, and how past traumas have affected my behaviors. I‚Äôve just started my program, and I can‚Äôt wait to do more!"
5,Lady shiv,"I have only been using for a few days, but am enjoying the app and exercises. It is nice that they start at a low level and work up to the higher levels. Will continue to use and see how much it helps."
5,SrslyNotAtAll,"I posted a review mentioning two issues on the app. Within 24 hours I got a response, and within roughly 48 hours both issues were fixed. Nice to find an app run by people that care if you‚Äôre happy with your purchase."
5,Rika S.,"I was looking for short brain games without having to purchase a large game I didn‚Äôt want.  I only wanted the ‚Äúmini games‚Äù the brain challenges.  This fits my needs perfectly.  Now I‚Äôm challenged to do better, be faster, more accurate.  I love it."
1,neverhavewrittenareview,"This used to be the best!  But the amount of glitches keeps increasing. For instance in the candy sort game, when you complete a level it will not progress to the next level for quite some time. It used to go right to the next level. Also, if you start a game on another day it won‚Äôt allow you to continue where you left off. I have found I have had to go back a couple of levels before it allows me to begin."
5,Myright1,It‚Äôs fun and interesting as you compete against the clock to be as accurate as possible. It shows you well you did based on the studies which also excites you because you want to do better each level
5,Claudia Sofia Davila,I adore how I can't get enough of these three amazing games that I love and would love to get ready to make the most of my summer break. I find it interesting how the platform provides users with questions to consider and how it asks what they want to do and improve on.
1,Tanisha228,If you go for the free option you get a 15 second add every 5 questions and it takes forever to do a quiz. And then once you get to the end it holds your results hostage unless you sign up to pay!!!! Wasted my time completely! The app takes every opportunity to charge you and is completely useless in the free version. You have to pay to make it worth it! And unsubscribing from a paid account definitely won‚Äôt be easy or fair.
5,Tipsysworld,"I am late in life DX‚Äôd adhd etc. always had trouble with math, memory skills and the like.  When I heard of this I did the introductory games and was hooked.  My memory has improved, math skills still lacking because of the timed games. But overall this has helped. Great idea"
4,Bre Krazii,Nice app for what it is. They do have a paid option but they also have free play as well and the candy sorting game has helped with my anxiety especially during work and even with bordem. I don‚Äôt mind the ads but the push for paid subscription is frequent which is why I took off a star.
5,Ashkracker,"I love playing games and since having children, I feel like my brain and I are disconnected. I love this app. I enjoy the quizzes, because they‚Äôre subjects I‚Äôve been curious about, and I enjoy playing the games (as stated above). I‚Äôm so happy I caught the sale which has allowed me to purchase for life!"
5,Emmeline_axolotl,"Ok so I heart Impulse so so so so much. If you're forgetful or want to get better at other stuff, like me... Impulse is the game for you! I personally love it so much! There aren't to many adds, there are daily practice games already chosen for you... Anyway, I love Impulse! It is so fun totally recommend it! Thank you for reading this! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°  TTYL!!"
3,TheLotusMind,"One of the games I play very often is the ‚ÄúWords crossword‚Äù. Occasionally I‚Äôm stuck and I want to see the solution. To my surprise, I have to watch a video ad of some games which I cannot even close. I actually have to close the Impulse app and reopen it‚Ä¶ Besides this annoying bug, it‚Äôs unacceptable to having to watch ads for a game that I already pay for!"
5,ShlickVic6,"I‚Äôve only been using the app for two days so I am not going to say that it is working on me already, but it is fun. I‚Äôve enjoyed the exercises and I do see how it will help down the road. I‚Äôm excited to see all the different improvements in me."
5,Suzkigs,Whenever I play impulse I feel my brain gets a good workout and I am sharper for giving myself the mental exercise. I need metal  exercises because I have  several brainsurgeries and at times felt that I needed to sharpen up my skills. This is one app that has helped a great deal.
5,carls junior 1543,"This game is so fun, and at first I was like,‚ÄùOk, well, I‚Äôve tried these games in the past, and haven‚Äôt had the best experience with them‚Äù but this game is actually pretty fun. The one line game could have some better quality, but this was actually really fun for me. I recommend it."
4,EraserheadBaby,"I think it‚Äôs very cool that you get a daily exercise based off of your goals, and an explanation on how each game/puzzle trains your brain. I don‚Äôt have a paid membership but I‚Äôm still satisfied with the free services this app provides. It‚Äôs got a decent amount of free games, puzzles, and tests including IQ tests and an ADHD test."
5,hello ur bad guy,"The app is great, but I feel as if there are too many ads, it is making my enjoyment with the app subpar, but if there was a way to reduce the amount of ads that pop up it would be great."
5,Crazygamer 123,Fun and exciting game. It keeps you interested every step. There‚Äôs a challenge if you accept. I like the accuracy. I like how much it is catered towards you and what your needs are. Some levels I don‚Äôt like because they‚Äôre too challenging for me. But that‚Äôs the point lol.
5,Precious564,"I was skeptical but paid. I‚Äôm 59 and can feel my concentration, short term memory and anxiety taking over. I decided I‚Äôm not going to let it happen. I feel young, I‚Äôm getting my body in shape and now my brain. It‚Äôs fun and challenging and I‚Äôm seriously competitive against my peers. Try it! It‚Äôs awesome!"
5,Shwacky1,"After suffering brain damage in the hospital, I really didn‚Äôt realize how much was gone until a good year and a half went by. I like these little games- they are fun and yet not overpowering. I am looking forward to my improvement!"
5,nevermindmy name,I love being able to play a game for relaxing or stress relief and knowing that at the same time my brain is being strengthened against deterioration . I‚Äôve often felt like games were a waste of time but with this app that is just Not the case!! Thank you for creating this!!
2,H4X1NY0UR$Y$73M,"It's an interesting idea for an app. But at the end of the day it's just a cash grab, capitalizing on the people who need more reassurance in their life. Psychology is a very broad spectrum, and 72 questions and answers ran through an algorithm simply isn't enough to give you a detailed understanding of how your brain and emotions work. Maybe a very slight understanding. But all in all, this app is about as useful as those Facebook quizzes that tell you what superhero you'd be."
5,cocobeens1234,"It‚Äôs a super fun game I have found myself choosing this game immediately when I pickup my phone. I also love how you can choose what parts of the brain you want to work on, your daily goal of play time,your approximate age,etc‚Ä¶ to get the perfect brain training fit for you."
5,Tiffynshermie,"It has been an amazing stress reliever. I also can tell that for the past two days after a few minutes my brain starts to ‚Äúkick in.‚Äù Coming from a cancer patient and someone who has ptsd, I highly recommend this app so far."
5,Mbjacobo,"I had a baby recently and realized that after pregnancy my memory and ability to focus were diminished. This is perfect, the exercises work and they‚Äôve short enough that I can do them even when the baby is awake"
4,Indecisive_individual,"This app has very fun logic puzzles and mind twister games, and it's a good mix of everything, and To add to that these are actually fun & intriguing games. Although to get full access you do have to buy a subscription. I would love to see the full capabilities of this app, but I do not have the money. Have fun Gaming!"
5,PheonixPlayer,"Impulse has helped me too relax and unwind while still keeping me on my toes, the only thing I don‚Äôt appreciate is how much you have to pay if you want to get the full experience. I really wish you could just see your test scores. Other than that Impulse is AMAZING."
5,roarrrrrrrrrrrrü¶ñ,This game is literally so amazing I am learning so much from this game even though I‚Äôm not too far and I‚Äôm learning so so so so so so much and I‚Äôm really happy that they got this game out like you know made this game and it can really be helpful for certain people if you try out the game BYE!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Catchureye ,I‚Äôve been needing a break from social media and this app is serving as the perfect replacement during my 30 day detox ‚Äî it‚Äôs  actually strengthening my mental faculties instead of dulling them. Grateful to have found this app during my social media detox!
5,chey.hoover,"I don‚Äôt typically leave app reviews, but I truly enjoy this app. They say your memory fades over time and this helps me feel like I‚Äôm doing my best to strengthen it. Some of the games are really challenging and make me actually think. A drastic difference from the mundane!"
5,Piglettpie,I‚Äôm having a great time with this app. I‚Äôm naturally competing and I love to improve my scores. Some of the games and tests can get pretty tricky but you walk away feeling accomplished. Even if you‚Äôre spending 5 - 10 minutes a day on it. Happy with the purchase.
5,ddavis2319,Very impressed with the huge variety in different quizzes to test your brain. The app is addicting though. I have began to look forward to new challenges everyday & love the fact it shows you where you rank among others. A++
5,happy420life,I like to use this app daily to keep my brain fully functioning in the crazy work environment in life that I deal with on a daily basis it helps my memory and helps me quickly find a solution to small problems that I have ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶great app worth the download
5,nikimomae22,I use this app when I feel sluggish. I notice in the morning I‚Äôm slower with the exercises than in the afternoon and evening. It helps my mind get the morning fog and boost I need. It helps clear my head if I am having headaches it truly is an amazing exercise app for your mind. I 100% recommend.
5,Mamajuju823,I never play games and never have apps I have a lot of OCD so I just can‚Äôt have anything I don‚Äôt need or use but I decided to take a chance on this game and I love it I can‚Äôt live without it now I think I‚Äôm gonna be playing games all day I‚Äôve only had it for four minutes. But I‚Äôm in love!!!!
5,KJ_6002,"I have been struggling with my memory for the last couple years so I decided to try this app out, just by using it for a couple of days I feel myself getting better with remembering. Great app 10/10 recommend it to anyone struggling to remember. ü§ôüèΩ"
5,Iowa_70,After a car accident causing a traumatic brain injury having to relearn many things this is great training for my brain. Relearning math and finding out I don‚Äôt remember certain math problems and other things to. This app is so very useful in relearning and finding what to relearn.
1,TGill3,"At first glance this app appears to be something of interest. Unfortunately following the download the user is faced with several prompts requesting that you sign up for upgrades for rather expensive fees.  This happen before you are able to even test out the product.    At one point it states that you can have a free trial, but will automatically be billed shortly there after.    I was not even able to explore what this app had to offer before I felt compelled to erase it from my phone, for fear that my account will be charged for something I DO NOT.   There is no way to cancel and I‚Äôm still unsure if my account is going to be billed.    There are several layers of deception.  I strongly advise all users to pay close attention during the download process.  As for my close friends, I will strongly advise them to avoid this app completely."
5,allieway1!,"Impulse is the best way to exercise your brain and make it fun!! After just a week I already think clearer and quicker and stay focused . Thank you impulse, you are an exceptional too!! I can not wait to see what else I am going to improve upon!!"
2,jdne s mkf,"70% tests results aren‚Äôt accurate and it‚Äôs being a paid subscription. It said gain 1 week free and cancel anytime. 8 hours after payment, I was charged $30 and can‚Äôt get a refund until the charge is posted. It hasn‚Äôt even been 24 hours and can‚Äôt do anything but regret paying for a subscription. I‚Äôm sure this app can help others explore more about themselves, but it doesn‚Äôt seem the results resemble me."
5,Dr. Barbie,"Finally found an app that helps me kill time when I‚Äôm bored, plenty of games to choose in one ap, and might even be good for my brain! I decided it was worth paying the one time fee so now I never deal with ads"
5,sweetlakezz,"So I was hesitant at first.  And then after a year I gave it a try.  It has helped so much.  I previously suffered a traumatic brain injury and have trouble remembering sometimes.  So I need this.  And I was give a fantastic discount for the pro version and let me tell ya, it was so worth it.  I do lessons everyday."
5,BigStick-oh-69,"Gives you limited results unless you wanna pay for it if it‚Äôs anything besides the basic training for the day, at least that‚Äôs what I found so far. But it‚Äôs a good game , at least the daily training ones are."
4,Milan025,"I think it has a nice variety of game‚Äôs and challenges. It‚Äôs response to your performance is honest, yet encouraging. You can also use the app without paying, if you‚Äôre willing to deal with some ad‚Äôs. You also can expect to see some cognitive improvement fairly quickly."
5,Clackyclack,This app takes my brain off day to day activities and helps it think in other logical areas in a fun way. Some of the games are relaxing before I go to bed but also require some level of thinking to keep me sharp.
5,Pywakitt25,You concentrate and as it goes your time gets shorter to finish a series‚Äôs of each game which makes you want to beat your time from the last game. There are several games to choose from. Tests your skill and expand your mind.
4,The one who didn‚Äôt want to,I love this app but in the quizzes you have to pay to get most of your answers but other than that love the game but paying is an issue for and other people so if you can't pay for games or apps I wouldn't get this game or get the game and know that you won't get the full answer unless you payüíµüôÇ‚É§‚ÄãüôÉ‚É§‚Äãü´∂üèº
5,Twin fang,I like it even with no having the subscription yet I can still see enough information from the test to want to keep the app and I‚Äôm really considering buying that yearly plan after just one day (I‚Äôm currently on day two)!
4,vsunesyhc,"Lots of great games and ways to improve on cognitive function.  ADHD friendly!!  There are no interruptions with ads.  There are minimal push notifications  I do wish it was free or even a bit cheaper per month. Sadly,  I won‚Äôt continue to use the app at the current subscription price."
1,Jeff Landon,"I signed up for a year of Premium, mainly for the tests. The games seem Ok but the IQ, ADHD, and personality tests are a JOKE. Not accurate, and has a disclaimer for entertainment purposes only. Sad, yet another app that doesn‚Äôt deliver. Seems to be the norm now. If you just want the games everyday I guess it‚Äôs worth paying for. I‚Äôm canceling after one hour of use. I‚Äôll find those kind of games for free. This app is all hype, in my opinion, and I was so excited when I first started! Like I said, really disappointed."
5,Casey4000,Compared to other apps I like this one the most so far. It‚Äôs got other things that ones like lumosity do not and I find them more enjoyable. Maybe it‚Äôs the graphics looking more like kids games but they‚Äôre more fun for me to play
4,spellflinger,I never give reviews but I‚Äôve been playing this daily and it actually helps so I decided to get the subscription and so far haven‚Äôt been disappointed but be warned they will try to over charge at first but if you ignore the first offer the game gives another for 92% off
5,delaubadere,"Loving the app so far. The ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù deal was quite a catch since only $10 more than the yearly subscription, the downside being you don‚Äôt get to test it first (since you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a one-time deal). Lots of games, levels, and tests. Loving it so far!"
5,coco freestyle,"Nice variety of games. The very slight anxiety from the speed-based is only because I‚Äôm competitive and want to score well. Especially enjoy the quizzes to get to know yourself better, but honestly one should prolly take with a grain of salt. Better than doom scrolling!"
5,mefh04,"I really like this game ü§≠ Idk if it‚Äôs actually helping my memory or not because the levels seem to be too easy for me, but it‚Äôs still fun and it doesn‚Äôt feel like one of those games with no concept or any type of purpose beside to just rot your brain."
5,Trying-To-Adult,"I usually don‚Äôt download apps like this, because it costs money, but this is an absolutely amazing app! It helps you get to know yourself a little better, and also helps with mental exercises to keep your brain, sharp and plastic!"
4,Henneball,Have not explored everything. Some times my phone didn‚Äôt register click so I ended up performing not well on some tasks/questions. The ones that worked seamlessly are great. Still a little curious on how some scores are low though it was done at pretty quick speed with 100% accuracy.
5,Pjstewart,"I am an artist so I spend so much time trying to creat problems for me to visually solve. I am also part of an Alzheimer‚Äôs Study. I find that interesting also. As I get older my memory is not as sharp as it use to be, so I feel that brain exercises should be helpful."
3,Kylie_77,"I‚Äôve been using the Impulse app for years, and have absolutely loved it until the update that happened within the last week. I liked having 5 different games to play each day, but since the update, the same 3 games play over each day. I loved having the variety of different games before the app update."
4,gurrenLogan,"Hi there, reaching out here as I‚Äôve tried other avenues to no avail-  First of all, great app. Love it. However, i paid to remove adds from the candy sort game and have since changed phones but still using the same appleID, yet it refuses to restore my purchase. I even have receipt from apple for the purchase. Please help"
5,Jjman575733889,"It does not take long to complete daily challenge but the effect is immediate and long lasting. It helps to prime your brain for a greater focus, problem solving and attention to details. It helps me to wake my brain up in the morning and begin productive day."
5,brittany0_0ann,I downloaded this cause I wanted some puzzle games and this app is also built to keep your brain active so it was a win win. The puzzles and tests aren‚Äôt hard at all but they are still enjoyable and I feel like I‚Äôm doing something good for my brain. :)
5,AshleyAw3some,These games are enjoyable. They seem easy however I know they are a good brain challenge for sure! It uses knowledge we learned and memorized in grade school or those earlier years of repetition so it seems knowledge we already have just don't use often
4,msles23,"Since playing impulse, I‚Äôve noticed my improvement for attention to detail. from day-to-day tasks to product management. So far I‚Äôve only been playing just for five minutes a day to relieve some stress, but thinking about changing it to help sharpen certain skills. It‚Äôs been pretty good so far!"
5,Devynpmua,"I‚Äôve had horrible brain fog for almost a year now from medications. I truly feel more alert and can think quicker and clearer since using the app daily! And unlike most adhd apps, I didn‚Äôt get bored after a day and stuck with it."
5,Katie063,"I like the way that it is sort of personalized to me and what I want to improve I don‚Äôt have the pro, but wish I could. But if you can‚Äôt afford than the regular is wonderful too. If you want something even better, which is optional, you should!!!"
5,TexasHasHurricanes,This game is great to keep your brain active or reactivated.  Highly recommend it to everyone as a way of making sure your brain stays sharp.  If you are already struggling with memory issues please consider trying this game to improve your memory.
5,Unhappy with Lowe‚Äôs,"I have tried other brain training programs but this is the best by far!  I love anything that makes me think and keeps my brain active. Many, many games to choose from and the lifetime option is wonderful. Others only do annually. This is a great app!"
4,Mstori880,"I hate playing games, but this app is fun. My husband and son are playing it too! I would subscribe if they had family sharing. All these subscriptions are getting expensive, especially when you have to purchase per person and have a family of 5."
5,THIEVING APP,I used to always use my phone constantly and wasting my brain away with a bunch of dopamine inducing apps. This app really has helped me since last year with my mental cognition whenever I felt myself slipping with my mental health. Love this and the ideas thank you!!üôèüèΩ
1,Scam47745854,"There is no way to delete this app after ‚Äúdownloading free trial.‚Äù It does not show up under subscriptions, and it automatically charges you after free trial ends. This app is a money making scam and the developers should be ashamed. Many many many reviews on the internet reporting the same thing. So sad that the developers of this app went to college, studied the magical language of computer science, in order to scam people for money instead of actually implementing some measurable good in the world."
4,ANDIEE93,"I enjoy the game a bit. I play without paying any money in. My only thing I don‚Äôt like when I didn‚Äôt the tests, to see the results I have to pay. I‚Äôve never paid for a game and I won‚Äôt start now.  Outside of that, I love to play the different games. It keeps me focused and had helped me realize in areas I struggle in."
4,ronniez26,"I would have given this 5 stars, but I‚Äôm not yet capable of that since it‚Äôs only my second day with the app. The games are fun and the higher levels can be somewhat challenging. The IQ test really put me to the test, but I did pretty well on it. All around solid app."
5,Excited Participant,"I like that the games are simple, quick, and actually fun. If I make a mistake it forces me to think twice which has been amazing for my attention span. I‚Äôm always in the go so whenever I have a moment I can pull this up  and the game is ready to go. Enjoy!"
2,Paygel,The ads on the free version are ridiculously long. I read another review where the developer said to just x out of the app after 7-10 seconds and that would be great except the x doesn‚Äôt show up until way longer than 7-10 seconds. I do click the x as soon as it appears but it takes sometimes longer than a minute! Annoying. Will delete the app.
5,Paisley tie,The games are really great! Fun! Entertaining! You think‚Ä¶.how easy is this going to be‚Ä¶..guess what‚Ä¶.?? Lol it‚Äôs not so easy but not impossible and I cannot wait to replay against my last score! I cannot say enough good about this app‚Ä¶.Try it out and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
5,Mount_Vito,"This is a great app that is filled with games that make you think and think quickly, but also is so much fun to play. The price is a little steep if you choose to pay weekly, but their deal on an annual plan for around $20 for the whole year is worth it"
4,DHolland6,Definitely a quick helpful way to keep the brain sharp! Wish it was slightly less expensive. The big 92% off deal helps but I‚Äôd rather be able to use that deal and pay monthly rather than whole year. I‚Äôll stick with free version until that is changed.
5,iConvertible,I love the daily exercises that keep me sharp. The games are practical for the brain because it helps your brain recall things that it already knows how to do. The faster you become with it the brain grabs up much more knowledge of concepts that you will need later. Awesome App!
4,lucy-fire,"Hello, I am one of the players who range from ages 13-17. I like most puzzles so this app is really cool for me. It forces me to critically think as well as use my common sense, something I feel like is no longer common. It‚Äôs a really cool app, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I‚Äôm hoping for something free from the app. My only issue is payment, but I understand why they do it."
5,EmilyGrace24,"I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days, so I‚Äôm still anxious to see how the games change over time, but I‚Äôm really enjoying so far. I haven‚Äôt paid for the premium yet but I may, because the ads really are annoying. ü´§"
5,njferrell,I absolutely love this game.. I have memory trouble a lot and this game helps me to train my memory and challenges me to really think about how to solve some of the problems.. it give detailed instructions if it‚Äôs a new game and it tests me in different ways and helps me be more confident in myself!!!
5,MMARN4,As a mom to a preschooler I am keen to idea of rewarding good behavior and it fueling positive behavior. I get it in a psychological level even more when I play these. It feels good to get things right! The games are fun. It becomes a race against yourself and their totally addictive suddenly 20 min passes in a flash. I highly recommend!
2,judypr092,I am enjoying these games but have contacted customer service three times by email and there has been absolutely no response. Not to mention that it was difficult to track down the email address‚Äî I had to find it here in reviews. As such I would not recommend this app. There are plenty that are similar but that also have responsive customer service.
5,moretaffa,I know I don‚Äôt remember enjoying school but this is fun. Feel like I could just do this all day. Being that my family has a history of mental illness I think I just might thanks for making it fun!!! Personally I think everyone should use this app big and small‚Ä¶
5,kimmojoshay,"This gave me a boost that I really needed in no my no life . I‚Äôve still got it just need to use it at 59 this is a MUST!   I‚Äôve been playin everyday and have moved on up in all the games. I love to challenge myself know 4a FACT IT KEEPS MY MIND ALERT. Really quickened my HAND  EYE COORDINATION.  Keeps  me sharp and proven FACT IT HELPS AGAINST DEMENTIA, Alzheimer‚Äôs so PROPS TO YOU AND THANKS"
3,Adampelt,"The games are fun and addicting, it‚Äôs a well-built app, but the ads are relentless and frequent. It takes far too many clicks to get to the next game, or to simply navigate the app. This app feels tolerable for a week or so, then will be deleted. It‚Äôs a shame, because it‚Äôs clearly more focused on getting your money via subscription than the brain training games themselves."
5,Arereanah,I just downloaded the app yesterday morning because I realize that I‚Äôve been going through a stressful time. Playing the little mini games on it really helps me feel more relaxed and I feel like it improves how I feel in general.
5,Jer Nals,Great game to play when you have some free time. It‚Äôs get you thinking just a little bit and challenges your hand and eye coordination. Impulse control to the max. Are you ready for it? Can be really easy sometimes though. Give it a try!
5,Art&War79,I think people would benefit from this app tremendously. It‚Äôs fun and accurate and shows you things you need to work on. Intelligence isn‚Äôt inna box cut and dry! There are layers and each layer helps you to become the best most effective you!
5,AllTorrey,"I‚Äôm a 54 year old female that has had a stroke this past year and I feel this games to be very helpful in trying to help me get back to my old self once again. Thank you for your free app version, for im sure if not for it I‚Äôd be stuck."
3,iutdhbxt,"Fun app for a little bit.  Your results in the games are compared to everyone else, so that‚Äôs interesting.   The games are very simple, yet they ask for an exorbitant $6.99 a WEEK‚Ä¶ They give a 92% off coupon for yearly right at the start before you even know what you‚Äôre getting into, and if you click out, they increase the discount by a little bit more. Not sure how legit everything is‚Ä¶  I guess these iOS apps ask for so much because of the Developer cost Apple imposes yearly. Otherwise, something like this would only be a one time payment of a couple bucks on Steam‚Ä¶ or free. Not much to justify any subscription at all."
4,katortiz77,I‚Äôll admit this game has helped me improve my anxiety a bit more but I can‚Äôt stand the constant ads after wanting to play a new level on the same game over and over. It‚Äôs so repetitive and annoying. I know there is a ad free but in this economy I ain‚Äôt subscribing to none of that. One ad is enough I don‚Äôt need 3 of them.
5,ronlovepeace1!,"I absolutely love the word guessing game. I‚Äôve been an honor roll English student so, I love words. this app I initially purchased during Covid and have enjoyed it so much I continue to buy an annual subscription to not only enjoy playing games but, strengthening my mind at the same time."
5,VICKYYYS_,"Easy to use, really gets your brain working! I feel better each and everyday while I continue to do the exercises, hopefully this is a new start to thinking better, quicker and keeping my brain healthy!"
5,Lesley Grande the dog groomer,I‚Äôm shocked how much I enjoy this app. It‚Äôs amazing at helping me learn how my mind works and also feels good to play the games and see my scores and percentages where I stand compared to others. I also enjoy the personality test part. That was really fun and informative. Thanks impulse!!!
5,Mariah Olsen,This App is great. Helps to call me down and I love the brain boost it‚Äôs giving me. Helps to lift my brain fog and has me focusing on the game and not the stress of my busy work days. Love the brain training. It‚Äôs helping with my focus And memory and helps to cognitively function better as a whole .
3,jessicamarie722,"Activities are fun, could be a cool app. Paid version might be decent but there‚Äôs way to many ads in the free version. There‚Äôs an ad after every activity, they are very long (and least double the time the activity lasts) and they hide the buttons to end the ax when it‚Äôs over. I uninstalled after a few plays."
5,Galaxii76,"I love the challenges that this puts my brain through, didn‚Äôt think my mind could think such a way. I feels great knowing that I still have the ability to strengthen some of my weaknesses. I‚Äôm happy that I am gaining more knowledge and strength."
4,Phoenix the seer,"The lagging after each level is completed on candy sort is annoying, especially when I play the game to decompress mentally and you have to wait up to a minute for the ability to continue to the next level"
5,Best for traveling!,"I have Lumosity as well, and tbh I enjoy these games so much more. They are challenging and the graphics are bright and fun to engage with. The personality tests are great and provide detailed recommendations on improving those areas of inadequacies, like a grown up report card. üòÄ I am highly satisfied with this purchase."
5,CDamianos,As a young person experiencing memory issues I have been using impulse to help me gain back some of what I have lost and I can say it has been nothing short of amazing plus it never really feels like I‚Äôm brain training I‚Äôm just playing games and having fun
5,Clb Joyce,I just found this app and is in love already! It reminds me of when I first went through retraining the brain. This app kept my busy and really soothes my brain. It helps me concentrate and leave the outside noise alone even if it happens.
5,Jeremiah22oo,"Compared to other brain activity games I have played ; as a type one brittle diabetic who survived a month long coma, I find this to be accurate, quick , to the point and scientific . I have visual memory loss ; this is wonderful in helping that issue . So far."
5,hnybny325,I have been enjoying getting myself to pay attention and to think about what I can do!  Age has taken some of my attention away and Impulse has given me the ability to bring it back
3,Jetii,The daily three puzzles are broken ‚Ä¶. I can play the first two but the last looks already played and the day is not registered as played. I really enjoy this app but this has happened for three days now‚Ä¶. I tried to report to support but the button to send the request is not working too. Please fix as I love using this daily.
4,ravila1023,"Downloaded a few brain training apps to try them out and this one seems to fit the mold for me. The app runs a special eventually for a year so I signed up. Tasks seem simple enough and increase in difficulty, has multiple tests to determine things like IQ and if you suffer from ADHD."
5,OhioTamasha,"After hard days, I want something mindless to help settle me to go to bed. This is better than ridiculous television and I don‚Äôt strain my eyes trying to read a book. Anytime I have a few minutes to kill, I pull this up! Love it!"
5,üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüñêüèæ,Just got it last night because I have nothing else to do when my wife falls asleep so I play this app 10/10 so far. Probably way better without the ads every game but I guess that‚Äôs why you pay for the subscription!
5,Why do we read names,"I honestly think it‚Äôs really good. However they need to add more games. Overall it was worth it, though there were a little more ads then I would have liked so I got the subscription but overall it is a good app and I recommend it."
5,411 food,Stress has been a lot lately so in order for me to focus and help with memory I wanted to Try out this app called Impulse it really helps me stay focused and sharp. Learn how to slow down and take everything in and they‚Äôre short and quick fun games.
5,LumbeeRN,Impulse Brain star is an awesome game. I have a very difficult time winding down at night when I get home from work.   After my shower an I‚Äôm in bed I start Impulse Brain Star and before I know it all my stress and worries from the day have melted away. I recommend this game to everyone.
5,Pokun113,"I have bought the lifetime version as a way to support the developers. I like the app and what it has to offer, slowly build up the confidence in training. I would also appreciate if there are more creative grammatical games to boost the language skills."
5,ShainaDay,"The free version of this app is just enough for me. Three mental challenges each day; it‚Äôs quick, it‚Äôs fun, and it‚Äôs challenging. I wish there wasn‚Äôt such a long ad before each challenge but other than that, I‚Äôve enjoyed the app!"
3,Macra440,"Enjoyed it at first and felt the subscription was worth it. Ultimately got bored of the repetition and got a little lazy so I let it sit for a while.   Finally got back to it and the daily puzzles were among my least favorite. Either way, I didn‚Äôt finish all 5 games, thinking it would reset the next day. 7 days in a row and it‚Äôs still the same 5 games. Over and over.   I get that there‚Äôs a training aspect and I‚Äôm probably getting these games because I score lower on them but sometimes it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt care enough to focus. No amount of motivation will get me to apply myself when swiping arrow directions.  Canceled my subscription."
5,Zidane Lionheart Strife,"This app is incredible, all the games are fun and the tests are informative and interesting. $99 for a year but they give you a 92% discount (that‚Äôs what I got) so I just subbed for a year. Totally worth it so far. I don‚Äôt mess with games on apps, I play PC games, but this gets me through the day on a good mood."
5,Lkarbelnig,"Growing up with Dyslexia I had to become good at learning it did not come to me as easily as some others. That being said, I love learning, staying sharp, and keeping up with the things I‚Äôve learned along way. This app makes it easy to do just that!"
5,RSsudzyfox,"Most apps fail to keep and hold my interest this not only fixed that but improved my cognitive functions so I love it everything is a positive, especially since they made it accessible to everyone and not charge for the most simplest aspects."
1,Brittsimmer,This app isn‚Äôt at all what I thought it would be but it‚Äôs my fault for not reading about it. I thought  that it was more like therapy videos and self reflecting sort of stuff. So I clicked to subscribe and I thought that I could just cancel at anytime without having to pay but boy was I wrong. I‚Äôve now learned my lesson ugh! It‚Äôs unfair; I think to undermine people and just take our money! Now I‚Äôll know next time there‚Äôs a no free trial; to not even bother trying it out!! What a scam.
5,Snavsava,"This site is wonderful. It helped me focus more on my memory and it helped me realize my IQ level, and how far I could go in life, it also help me realize that I could do better in school that I am already doing, I really appreciate this app, and what it does for people."
5,crom827,"I like the games-there are many to choose from and they‚Äôre challenging. I like that the score tally will tell me where my skills fit in with my peers-when that number is lower than I‚Äôd like, it make me want to do it again to score higher."
1,Mcbard,"I got the free 3 day trial.  Which hello means you get to use everything for free for 3 days.   I take the archetype test.  Spent 30 minutes answering all the questions and at the end, oh you only have access if you pay for the upgrade.  This should have been stated before I took it.  A good business model wouldn‚Äôt rely on tricking people into paying money.  If the product is good you wouldn‚Äôt need to do that and people would just continue to use it, glad  to pay."
5,Great God of Fire,"Just started, no idea if it will actually help improve my brain function, but it HAS to be better than scrolling social media!!   The games are fine, tons of variety and difficulty and the app is soiled, intuitive with no glitches."
5,mias opinon!,"This game helps so much! it helps you a lot it, kinda tells you stuff you don‚Äôt know about yourself! For example it tells your personality type, your gpa, etc. You will not regrets downloading this game. Like I said before it helps you a ton!!"
4,SatyaSeeker,"For someone with an aging neurodivergent brain it‚Äôs important to continue to try to improve my executive functioning as well as working memory. I feel like the games in this app do just that, but only take up a few minutes of my time and attention per day. A win in my books!"
3,trubex,If it‚Äôs for real then it‚Äôs a great way to get a workout. It‚Äôs fun and bright colors. There‚Äôs a lot of communication. You ask questions that have right or wrong answers. Not in between. It‚Äôs a nice swift game. Well I want to go back to playing it. I will think of other ways it can ‚Äúimprove‚Äù but none come at the moment possibly because my brain got a workout and it‚Äôs tired.
5,weeertty,It seems the number I get older and years the slower my brain seems to process things. My cognitive functions are slipping in before they get out of hand I‚Äôm trying to use my brain in a different way every day and it‚Äôs helping. So far.
1,edifyme2,"In order to cancel the ‚Äòfree‚Äô trial you have to go through Subscriptions on your account and it has to be 24 hours before the end of the trial. It‚Äôs been 2 days since I signed up for it and it‚Äôs still not showing up in my subscriptions to be able to cancel in time. I‚Äôm emailed them at 2 different support emails and no one has responded. I‚Äôve reported them to Apple as fraud. Very scammy! DO NOT TRUST! This is the second one star review I‚Äôve tried to post, the other one never showed up."
5,Galact0,Just simple brain things just keeps me busy when I‚Äôm bored and you can never stop play! Very addictive and you can get a free trail as a start so you can see if you like and you can cancel the subscription anytime you like! Hope this review helps you.
5,BusyBodyHank,I work in a fast paced environment where your eyes and brain activity are constantly moving and bouncing around and with Impulse I am allowed to decompress from my days activities in a fun educational way. Definitely will try with my kids. Thank you!!!
5,bunnynoodle,"I enjoy using this app. I feel like I‚Äôm utilizing my time wisely as far as choosing what types of games to play. Even though I may use it once in a while, I can definitely see in improvement in my focus, decision making, and memory skills."
5,Iihgfryjbcf,If you‚Äôre wasting time on your phone you might as well be working out your brain. Games simple enough for the short attention span of wannabe influencers but complex enough for those taking a break from reading.
2,Obadoba,"Cool app, puzzles and games reminded me of another app that I used a few years ago. That being said, uninstalled the app within 30 minutes of use. (Enough time to complete one of the IQ tests) My reason for deleting the app was due to every other screen asking me to subscribe. I understand most of these apps monetize their functions as a way to maintain the app and stay relevant, but there is a difference between a quality application and a gatcha game."
5,KrazeeKansasGma,"WOW this exercise is really brain exercise.  It‚Äôs completely different than the brain games I‚Äôve been playing!  It‚Äôs a challenge and unlike multiple choice, matches, or word games, this one will make you feel glad when you complete the daily tests!"
5,Jonsnosemom,"This is not a game, this is way better, this is not some old lying game, its a real and awesome way to train ur brain for memory, focus, and even people with ADHD which would be me, focus and memory is my main problems, so this helps a lot, i guarantee this will help, i suggest trying it"
5,alasadagd,"I love puzzles and I love challenging my mental state to help me stay sharp, focused and alert. This game does it all for me. It measures my performance metrics and even allows me to play mini games after doing my daily quizzes. Plus they have enough free content to occupy time without paying for a subscription. Great app!"
5,Myfirstandlastnames,"This app has so many games that scratch my itch for mathematical thinking üíö I work in a creative field so math is not something that I practice day to day, and it‚Äôs had an impact on my focus and memory. Three days into these games and I feel the benefit of playing, sharpening my attention, and I LOVE them all."
5,Kyle Silvestre,"I never saw mental workouts as helpful or  as necessary as physical workouts. Impulse has helped me realize how important mental workouts are. I have only tried it for a few days but I can see that with consistency, my mental efficiency will improve. Great app with accessible pricing!"
5,DrumaStyle39,I just just want to rate this game 5 stars hands down its releases high anxiety it‚Äôs strengthens your mind and your concentration it‚Äôs something to do while your on a short break long ride or if you have bad anxiety. Test yourself to try and go the limit unless for you there‚Äôs no limits at all
5,megroe30,"I have only been using the app for two weeks and already see a difference in my cognition. I am able to recall things better, make better decisions quickly, and honestly it‚Äôs help to improve my mood! Thanks so much for this awesome app!"
5,love all your fam,I really like this apparently it‚Äôs the best way for you to get your hands on the game so you have to do something to make it work for your game as long as you have the ability to play with the game
5,Levineely,"I was a fan of Big Brain Academy from a while ago, and enjoy doing brain training that is akin to gameplay. This app does that for me on the go and on my phone, which is cool! I liked the IQ test and hope to see continued improvement as I train more."
4,üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Ä¶,"NEEDS LARGER FONT! 2nd time prompted to review, months later, (I don‚Äôt even remember leaving the first review lol) still the same..fun & i‚Äôm sure the difficulty level increases but I haven‚Äôt spent much time here bc I need to be able to increase font size. If a developer sees this, if you could, please advise for those of us who require glasses or are partially visually impaired. Ty"
5,Trishann123,I love this app! The creators really know their stuff! Memory improves as you play. I just wish the premium version was free because I‚Äôm so broke I could only try the trial period but as soon as I can come up with the money I will be getting the premium edition!
5,ü´∂üèæüòÅ,"It‚Äôs a great way to take your mind off of what‚Äôs been bothering you. It really helps with concentration and it helps you focus on one things at a time. It improves your skills in working, reading, writing, organization, and math. This is a great app! I would 100% recommend."
5,IndigoHawthorne,"I‚Äôve been hesitant to try this game because of the cost, however I will say that this is one of the best, challenging and fun game helping me sharpen my memory and brain speed. When one gets older, mental agility and gymnastics are essential to an easier life. Bravo!"
5,Connieartie,I look forward to using the Impulse app everyday. Finding out all the tasks I‚Äôm not as good at as I thought is helpful and enlightening. It‚Äôs challenging in the most fun way and a great tool for those like myself who are monitoring our cognitive abilities as we age. I recommend it!
5,scoobydoolover69,I feel like with my medications and autoimmune disease that I am losing dexterity of my memory and thought processes. But my biggest challenge is my ADHD.  Just getting on here and doing the exercises is challenging enough yet it it is fun which makes it easier for me to do so.
5,Lil_bit_crazy,"I‚Äôve been needing an app like this in my life! I haven‚Äôt had a lot of time on the app, but so far  I love the different games they offer. I also appreciate how everything is categorized for ease of use. It‚Äôs great, can‚Äôt wait to find more things to love about it."
5,Barliors,"It‚Äôs fun and I see the value for sure. I will say myself and two friends got the same result from the ‚Äúrandom discount‚Äù box. Seems fake and unnecessary, you can offer a discount without making someone feel like they‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù something."
5,I like turtles 1321,It gives you personal questions that makes you feel better about yourself and feel like you‚Äôre not alone and overall build your character and your view of life.
5,Bigbearblondie,I really enjoy this game. It helps to take away anxiety and stress and I need to focus. It also gives me answers about myself that I didn‚Äôt otherwise think I would have. I love the games. They are simple. They will help you to learn a lot about yourself.
1,Nick Jonas.,"I downloaded this app because I wanted to take some of the tests they offer such as my archetype. The app implied these were free but when I downloaded the app it made me sign up for a paid account. I got a 3 day free ‚Äútrial‚Äù but when I completed my first test, it wouldn‚Äôt let me access the report without paying for the full subscription. The ad and free trial were both misleading and just wasted 20+ minutes of my life for something I could easily replicate online. 1 star from me :("
5,Curtinly,I used to play brain training games on Nintendo DS and loved them. I decided to try this app out because my friend mentioned it. I like the games and I like that there are different tests you can take. I recommend this game if you don‚Äôt want your brain to turn to mush.
3,NOT A HAPPY BJs APP CLIENT,"There are some games on this app that do not progress to the next phase after you complete it. For example the candy sort game. Once you complete all of the flasks and have organized the candy, the app does not allow you to go to the next board and freezes on the board just finished."
4,Miss Williams88,"It‚Äôs a little easier than I thought. It could be a a little more challenging. Either way, it is still a good app to have when your bored or need to pass time. Wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the better features but nothing in life is free right?!"
5,Pretty Rikki97,I feel like being able to do things that actually test your brain helps improve in many ways! I just started but I plan on doing this as often as I can for my health and to get myself mentally better!
5,Ericygo93,Have been loving this app. The only thing I wish you could do is have shared access among iPhone family members so they may be able to enjoy the app as well
4,Rainbows and awesome,"I totally get making money off people buying ads free but I‚Äôm taking a star away because you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to train your brain. Other than that, the games are SO FUN! It take like 10 seconds to just skip the ads and play the games. It is what it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,"Smart, Mark","I find these games to be very very helpful for me. I never did very good and well in math when I was in school but the math seemed fairly simple so I got quite a few correct. An avid recycler so and I know colors well, so putting the red in the trash, and the blue in the recycling was just natural for me."
5,olivialazooo,"Fun and stimulating! The price for a year, in my opinion, is fantastic compared to other brain training apps trying to charge anywhere from $50-$100! I recommend for anybody, even though the levels aren't hard enough for me yet it's stimulating."
5,FilBilly RayRay,"This is a great app to get your mind out of the usual norm of why you are on your phone and helps with focus and brain stimulation. Worth to pay the money.  You‚Äôll get an option to pay yearly, maybe for even $30 a year. Check it out! Try it out!"
4,Lima60,"I am happy with the app ,it is very helpful, but since 2 weeks ago, I am receiving only three daily recommended assignment, not five or six like before. I tried to look for your phone number, and there is no way to get it and call to let you know, hopefully I will get an answer from you."
5,Dog6021YT,"As you may see in the title, I don‚Äôt do many reviews so it is a rare thing, but I really love this app (I hope it doesn‚Äôt make me pay later) and I think it‚Äôs great for self improvement and mind improvement, üíØrecommend!"
5,VadymK,Highly recommend you try it out. Not only it‚Äôs a good brain training app but there is a one time payment and no monthly payments like other apps seem to love to do. Give it a chance and try it out and buy it for life if you love it too.
5,Akash B,I like this app because I usually use it to play the mini games in between tasks I do throughout the day. The app is very responsive and I enjoy the new games that are added from time to time
1,snailwhit,"All of your ads talk about finding your brain type or adhd type or whatever, but not even one of these reports is available in the free trial. This makes your ads seem quite misleading.  Your response says ""Please be aware that on a free or trial plan, you will still have access to basic results only, such as your IQ score, trauma response type, archetype, ADHD type, etc."" This is not true. You cannot see what ADHD type you are without paying money."
5,Ruby Q Mace,It‚Äôs good because all ages can play it like my daughter that is 16 or my other son that is 10 they both wanted to play it and I love it because there‚Äôs so many different options of games and it helps my brain. And my daughter that is 7 she loves it.
4,YaoiOtaku,"I don‚Äôt go for app games usually- but the aesthetic they used looked nice in the ad I got and the puzzles are really fun! It‚Äôs also on the ‚Äúshort and sweet‚Äù end of app games. And they‚Äôre all different puzzles so it isn‚Äôt boring to play, ya know?? Plus- it gives a score based on people in your ranges results and I always think that‚Äôs fun. ^^‚Äù"
5,Manxis107,Mentally kickstart your day the right way! End the mindless scrolling through social media or browsing the new inbox delivery as soon as your eyes open and stimulate that reality bending world changing orb of meat that sits between your ears instead. Really. Start today.
5,marschun,"I wanted to try out this app because I‚Äôve been looking for something fun for my 70 year old mom to use. We all age and this is a fun app that helps people stay sharp. After playing with it for my free trial, I‚Äôve decided to buy the lifetime version for my mom to use."
4,Nep Deep,"I love the app so far, but have some slight issues. 1. Can‚Äôt easily find the personality test results for the tests I have already done. Haven‚Äôt found them at all actually, maybe not used the interface‚Ä¶  2. Sometimes I swear I hit the right tiles and it says I‚Äôm wrong but I swear I give the same answer again and it‚Äôs right. I think it‚Äôs probably me and also the app but definitely feels off sometimes. 3. Sometimes it‚Äôs very easy to hit wrong button if you tap slightly off. If your finger is slightly slipped. That changes the score. Maybe larger buttons? Overall I like the app so far!!!"
5,MatanYlevy,"Have been in therapy forever and this app literally is a game changer.  It lets you works on you your way, not the therapist or books only way. When you actually invest the time to work on yourself you see greater results"
5,A‚Äôs pov,"This is easy to do and incorporate into your day. They are simple, fun games that pass the time. Why not do some good brain stuff in the process instead of just watching videos or just zoning out? I like it. I‚Äôd recommend the app to just about anyone."
2,MissChristyM,"I recently tried this app.  There are some interesting brain games. However, I tried this game as a free trial. I did cancel more than 48hrs before my trial ran out and they still charged me for the 2nd week.   I tried contacting and no response as of yet to refunding me.   I don‚Äôt suggest trying this unless you actually are prepared to pay weekly for the app."
2,Autumnmariah,"I wouldn‚Äôt know of what is in the app is worth anything. I doubt it is, after encountering my first paywall and going the annoying steps I took a test that was ammture, stupid, and filled with nonsense questions. It was long and irritating. When I finally finished I hit yet ANOTHER paywall. Even though I have agreed to pay after a 3 day subscription it demanded I payed more to get results.  I wasted my time, DONT waste yours"
5,TexasEins,"I've always known that brain training is good for my mental health, Memory, and Cognition but I never had the time to sit down and actually do it. Impulse let's me set a realistic amount of time each day to do a quick brain workout and the games are fun too!"
5,Best first audio book,I like that it gives you options of what to develop and the games are pretty fun! Quick dopamine release when you see how you‚Äôre doing well - also like the feedback in how I‚Äôm comparing to others in a similar demographic.
5,smccar06,"I like the games a lot and I‚Äôm very picky. They are challenging but still fun. Not a fan of the ads but I already have so many bills, not trying to pay for another one. The free version is very enjoyable but the ads are enough to make a person insane."
5,Miri the scari,"As someone who has a learning disability, math has always been hard for me. I was so worried about being intimidated ((yes even on an app)) but this was actually really easy.   I love the games - they make my brain like‚Ä¶ wake up? It‚Äôs like it stimulates my brain. I really love it."
5,SueLyn-Boston,"The games in this app are really interesting‚Äîmore than in other similar apps I‚Äôve tried‚Äîand the UI (the directions, feedback, etc) have a sensible and friendly tone. highly recommended!"
5,Grace 2 u,"The training is a mind awakening. I am enjoying it everyday. I really like the challenges, easy to comprehend instructions and follow. It‚Äôs a great mental keep up especially in my age, retired and less responsibilities since my kids are all grown ups. Thank you for creating this wonderful mental exercises."
5,Jasercise,"For someone who is diagnosed with cancer, and has had multiple surgeries in a short amount of time along with treatment my cognitive skills memory have been not what they used to be. However, I find that this Apple loan has helped me improve substantially."
5,SerenaAnneKat,"I have found, since I‚Äôve been getting older, my memory has been getting a bit difficult, but playing this game I have seen an improvement over these past few week. I totally recommend for any age."
5,sterrrling,"quite literally just installed and began using this app. I‚Äôve played one memory game and so far so good, but it‚Äôs early. üëçüèª constructive feedback: if at all possible, don‚Äôt prompt users to rate and submit feedback on the application during their first session."
2,mc_CLOUD,"While the library of games is pretty good, I‚Äôve been a subscriber since the app launched and new games/content are released maybe 1 time every 3 months.   Also, on some games like Words Crossword, you have to watch ads to get additional hints. I would be ok if I wasn‚Äôt already paying a subscription. Also, the ads are the sketchy type that force you to download the app in the ad before receiving a hint."
5,JoannaM.,I love how challenging this game is and the fact that it‚Äôs something different everyday. It also tells you how well you scored va others that have played. I feel great about scoring better than 90% of my peers that played the same game!
5,Madmaxlp,"Impulse truly works and challenging toward your individual skill levels! I am on the 3rd daily challenge; I tell you, so far so good! I highly recommend this app to anyone willing to challenge their current impulse skills and also elevate their cognitive thinking üí≠ ‚úîÔ∏è"
5,DNorth1418,"I work out my body every day‚Ä¶.my brain is part of my body‚Ä¶logically I need to work out my brain. Love the quick fun games, haven‚Äôt been playing long but hope with dedication I start to see improvements in my recall, focus and general cognitive strength."
1,23456seveneight,I got a deal yesterday that said I would be paying $0.57 each week and then it took out $28. Which is ridiculous to me. If you‚Äôre going to charge that much then don‚Äôt even put the weekly payment because it‚Äôs not real. They charge the full price right then and there. Anyways that all I have to say I really hope they fix that. I want my money back in all honesty. Don‚Äôt download the app. I personally believe after reading the good reviews that most of them are fake.
5,gddgxhdh,"I love impulse so much! It‚Äôs great it helped me get better grade at school! I do wish all options were free, but there is a good selection to play! And you can chose your problem areas to get better! I‚Äôve only had it for about a week, but I love it so much! Thanks Impluse!!ü•≥"
5,FupaSurgeon,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs doing anything for my  brain, but I do enjoy doing the exercises. I have had a few concussions, so even if it‚Äôs just a somatic effort, at least it helps me feel better. I do recommend it. If you have any doubt about your sharpness, give it a try."
5,Seek Harmony,"I am on bright when I have some free time at work or when I am bored. For instance, I completed some IQ tests today while I was lying down. I found out so much about my personality and emotional intelligence. Recommend if you are interested in improving your cognitive abilities."
5,DocteurN,"Great app for making your brain work in ways that you may not use as often as you should. Just like a workout, some areas may need more attention, but everything gets challenged just the same."
4,DeJa Renee LLC,I just downloaded the app and it‚Äôs been pushing me in a healthy way to continue to play these brain games and get my brain going in the morning as well as helping me slow it down at night! I would definitely recommend it for someone who is looking for more stimulating apps to help with productivity.
3,Pdizzle194,I bought this game for the one-time payment so that my investment would be sound if I ‚Äútrain my brain‚Äù daily. I enjoy the games a lot and the results help me better understand my strengths and weaknesses. But it is unclear what measurements they evaluate and how the algorithm works. Perhaps if there was a little bit more transparency ‚Äî considering this is MY brain ‚Äî I would rate this app higher.
5,Shelzer Hound,I really do enjoy this app. It stimulates my brain in ways I forget to in a day. It‚Äôs also fun for the most part. I enjoy the games and challenges. I‚Äôm not so into how it tells me about my responses to fear and trauma but that it probably cause it‚Äôs fairly accurate.
1,Mieczkowski,"I bought the full member ship which is about fourth dollars and I did this before I Astarte using the application and it was a mistake for sure. The game I saw advertised is not even one they offer and I‚Äôve been doing this for fifteen days and every single day it prompts me to set a reminder to so my daily exercise. There is no way to turn off that and just overall I would say save your money I am sure there are much better products available, that are more affordable and honest in their advertising."
5,üêîüê∑üêÆü™øüê∂ü¶äüê∞,Is incredible nice playing this game when I had knew I couldn't look remember thanks and now I remember everything plus I've been able to focus more must a must download if you have ADHD. 5 stars for a fact.
5,lisa rocky tt,"I really enjoy this app. It keeps you on your toes with fun activities. It's not hard by any means. The instructions are well stated and you are given time to complete the challenge. If you need a reason to play on your phone, let this app be it!!"
1,Ganjeremy Fonzarelli,They let you play a couple games then INSTANTLY ask you to start a subscription that of course is billed yearly. If you‚Äôre a normal person and don‚Äôt want to make that big of a commitment to an app you downloaded like 5 minutes ago you get absolutely bombarded with ads. Literally an ad before and after every game. Only get this if you‚Äôre not bothered by being spammed by the same 3 ads or are willing to start a yearly subscription.
5,Littletweetybird,I‚Äôm on a sobriety journey right now and this app has been VERY helpful! My memory is getting better and it gives me something to do when I‚Äôm craving or having anxiety. If you‚Äôre on a journey to become a better you this is the app!
5,shhhhhhhhhh388,"When I first downloaded this game, I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd have to pay to even attempt some of the puzzles. I was just looking for a game that would relieve stress and improve IQ. I don‚Äôt really have money so I can‚Äôt give any trials a try."
5,Blah blah girl 420,"I love the convenience of being able to train my brain on the go, as a mother and someone who has past trauma and lives with ptsd this really helps keep my brain sharp and making knew neurological connections to keep my brain healthier."
5,Wais Bey,"The user interface is second to none. And the games are versatile, and they provide a variety of options. I have been using this application for quite some time. My children love to play it as well. Five stars."
3,Jdonae,Games I played were ok but it only has a 3-day trial before having to pay. During this trial it will say you have analysis/tests available but it won‚Äôt tell you you have to have a paid subscription to get results until after you‚Äôve answered 40 questions. Do not recommend!
5,Stress Relieved,"The daily training is short and fun.  And I like the reminder to take a minute for myself .   I‚Äôve just started but this is something I can commit to and it will get harder as I get better, so it will always challenge me."
5,FossiBossi,I have been using the app for about a week. The games are fun with different levels of difficulty. I enjoy the percentile ranking after each game. It can tell you what you are really good at and where you need to improve.
5,darcycole1976,"I am having a difficult time with my memory for a number of reasons: I‚Äôm 48 and going through perimenopause, I have severe ADHD (hello, Vyvanse!) and I have Cirrhosis which impacts my memory big time. THIS SPECIFIC APP WILL HELP YOU TO CONCENTRATE!! I think it‚Äôs very fun and it‚Äôs not a hassle to do. Some of these apps can be a real drag! So A+ to IMPULSE! ü§©üòÇüëçüèΩüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Gr8Coco #5,I find that using Impulse at the end of a long day helps me clear my mind of all the nattering and I just focus on the games  and strategy I need to complete the activities. It lowers my stress level before I‚Äôm ready to go to bed Which leads to a better night sleepüí§
2,CandySorter,"As others have noted, candy sort has become almost unplayable since the update. Lag when pressing buttons, lag when switching between screens. Size of the play screen changing drastically. Most times when trying to advance the game via the continue button it will just sit on a blank screen. Needs to be fixed."
1,Cajunreba,"I had to delete the app due to the games not pulling up and redownload it, but it will not let me restore my purchase of a years subscription. There is no way in the app to cancel the free trial either so I may have to delete completely so I am not charged for another year. My subscription is good until 2025 but I cannot access it. I have no website log in, the app never prompted me to create one. No way to get help in the app either."
5,JAG912,"Maybe I‚Äôm just ADHD‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been doing these puzzles and practices in my mind since I was a child. Focusing through the app gives rhythm and reason to the practice. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to sharpen their most effective tool, their mind."
5,Marvey8,I just started working with this app and really enjoy it. It gives me a few minutes each day to sit down and exercise my brain. I look forward to progressing to a little harder games each day.
5,kittyhz4u,So far this app has helped me with getting my memory being back more on track where it was when I was younger. The games are fun little games and I enjoy them. The quizzes are an enjoyable side bonus as well. Keep up the good work y‚Äôall.
5,AR.1983,This is a great game. They recommend fun activities that keep your mind sharp. Just started doing it but I already paid for the year subscription. Look forward to taking the IQ test recommend anybody at least a one week trial.
5,Fila chick,I‚Äôve tried a couple of apps and got bored with them. This Impulse seems a bit more measured and interesting so far so I‚Äôm looking forward to my training each evening. Early days but I‚Äôd recommend trying it to see if it is a good fit.
4,yeahgene,I get bored with the lights and tasks and minutia of games on apps. This helps my brain to completely disengage and focus on worthy games. Brain fog is real with adhd and this allows a focus outside of all the things we need want or don‚Äôt want to do. Dopamine hits from doing well. Enjoying it. Two day streak so far.
5,Mikehblaze96,this app has let me learn so much about myself from there many different tests they have and I enjoy playing there games to help with training my brain I think the app develop did a great job with the design of the app as well as the instructions for the game
5,Did you know kenz,I like it so much is is one of the best things I have ever downloaded. I like it because it has fun games plus you learn at the same time üòç it tracks so many things and it is cool I recommend this game so much so please download it.
5,jcat's iTunes,I‚Äôm using the free version & I disabled notifications so it doesn‚Äôt add stress to my life so I can just play when I want to. It does make you think. It builds difficulty levels as you go and shows how your performance compares to other users.
5,Rima123456789,I just started because I can‚Äôt focus and just drift through the days after I started using this app I‚Äôm hopeful it has a lot of games and things to do and it‚Äôs fun plus the full access was only like $24 for a year
5,ElDedo1,Lots of fun with great brain teasers to test you through out your day. Nice to keep your self engaged while keeping your mind sharp instead of doom scrolling on social media like the normal modern zombie these days Go out for a walk get some sun instead and do this from time to timeüòâüëç
4,Conrad_71,"Thought it was a good deal for mental awareness. Though I‚Äôm still curious as to why when I switched phones, I still cannot log into my old account where I had done tests and and challenges. How does one know progress if it changes back to new after switching phones."
5,claireespo,I really enjoy this app. It challenges you and keeps your mind sharp. You can tell that the creators put a lot of thought into how the mind truly works and what exercises and games would help improve the brains overall performance.
1,Jenna Frank,"Wasted time answering 40 questions just for a screen at the end saying I need to pay to see my results. Tell us before we answer all those questions! They know exactly what they are doing. Hope the temporary money is worth all the lost respect from your users and possible positive recommendations to others. If this app ever gets brought up in conversation I will make sure to tell people exactly what it is, a money hungry creator with a app that‚Äôs waste of time and a deception."
2,EnnaRenee,So I thought this would be a fun game and a way to get to know myself a little bit more and possibly improve some skills. I went ahead and paid for a subscription the basic level one $6.99 a week and it won‚Äôt even tell me a detailed result for any of the tests; it gives me a one-word answer and ask for more money to see the ‚Äúreport‚Äù I find that annoying to say the least.
5,SnickerDoodleJules76,So far I absolutely love this app. I have been able to learn so much about my processing styles and how to improve them. I‚Äôve been able to work on my short term memory which has been an issue for years.
5,Piam4,I enjoy the app more than I thought I would. I have ADHD and it forces me to focus vs careless mistakes because I want to perform well and improve. I do feel that it helps me with response time as I‚Äôm trying to process quicker than usual.  Like thinking on my toes quicker.
5,darlbh,"I genuinely do not enjoy phone games. Too much story, too many things to collect‚Ä¶Blah blah blah. I like that this is simple and actually makes me feel like I am practicing skills. I like to zone out at my phone just like everyone and this may actually be benefiting my brain‚Ä¶win win."
4,bubbindl,"I really enjoy the variety and style of games it offers, but if you want to sit and play it for 15-20 minutes it‚Äôs not ideal. every other level or puzzle you'll get a popup ad, and some of them have those fake 'x's that take you to the app store."
5,Dvmares,"Coming from a family that is prone to Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. I feel that it is necessary for me to keep my brain active, so I don‚Äôt fall into that category when I get older. I love the games and I love how user-friendly it is."
1,BoomBoomBase,"I found this app on an advert and downloaded out of curiosity and boredom.  This app offered a free trial to pro but when I clicked it ended up charging me.  I tried to cancel straight away and report it for refund but was denied.  Furthermore; since my refund was denied, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have full access to this app but as it happens, I don‚Äôt.   So now you‚Äôve taken my money without the service you claim to provide for it.  Where is the ZERO start option???"
5,Midnight Tee,"If you want to maintain your mind strength then this is a great game to play. Even if you need to build it back up then your definitely playing the right game!! You will have loads of fun doing it, just check it out you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!"
5,AH-STL,Always believed I was stupid.  Didn‚Äôt go to college but started my own businesses and previously was the highest grossing sales rep and later BP of marketing and advertising.  Can read and speak Hebrew and lead orthodox Jewish services. Was always scared to take IQ tests for fear they would prove that I‚Äôm a dummy   Thank you
3,stefanschaefer,Cool app lots of interesting stuff but the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù isn‚Äôt a free trial at all. It‚Äôs just a marketing gimmick so they can try and convert you to a subscriber using manipulation. They don‚Äôt actually let you see the results for anything until you subscribe. Which they give you a ‚Äú90%‚Äù discount for to make you think you‚Äôre getting a steal.   Interesting app. Sleazy business practice.
5,yp apliance solutions,"So far I have been working with the app since yesterday and I love it, it's interesting all games and stuff that they have to keep your mind in shape. I always try to get the app to help me maintain my brain in shape but this one so far has everything I only one app."
5,claire without the i,"I‚Äôm enjoying these games. I‚Äôm doing better than I thought I would. I‚Äôm have no idea if this will train me to be more attentive or creative, but right now it‚Äôs enough that it‚Äôs more fun and relaxing than lots of the apps /puzzles where there endless ads."
3,greywolf53000,"See, ads themselves are okay, but when i am on a streak in connect the dots and an ad pops up i get soooo mad! Tips that should be added, less ads and 10-12 age group. My Iq is 128 and I‚Äôm 11 but when i took an advanced and quick Iq test it put me below 90. I would rate this a five if they could fix these things, but overall its a fair thing"
5,Blakeconwar,It gives you things that you didn‚Äôt know and it tells you the percentage of people are the same as you or it can tell you by if you‚Äôre better than others.
5,jhhihiji,This is by far one of the best brand games I have ever used. It has different daily activities for you to do it tells you your percentages on how you did and it barely has any ads.
2,CutieCucumberüíó,"Ridiculous that I have to pay to use it. You can improve by finding some way (other than a 3 day free trial) to keep at least a portion of the app free. Do this especially for students or those who are budgeting, but also want to reap the benefits of using an app for brain training. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the app seems great and has potential."
5,Bunny girl üê∞‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíãüíãüêá,I love this app I only got it two days ago and I love it so far the games are simple and fun. I love the variety of games and how they‚Äôre all heated towards a different way of brain training. If your thinking about getting this app I would definitely recommend it. üß†ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑
5,Briole,I just started using this app and so far it‚Äôs pretty cool. Definitely makes me focus. When I have a flare up with my fibromyalgia my brain fog makes it hard to concentrate on things. And I am stuck at home in pain. This app keeps my mind busy with good stuff vs mindless crap.
5,an super hot white shirt,I thought I could only enjoy this to have a subscription but that‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôll pressures you in the beginning but the ads aren‚Äôt that bad that you can‚Äôt enjoy what it has to offer. It‚Äôs only been a few days but I think the app is pretty cool. -DAJ
5,Vyesal,"If you want to push your mental training to the next level, look no further. The daily challenges will get the ball rolling and pushes you to achieve higher scores with each task. Absolutely love this appt and I highly recommend you download it."
5,Juliet Mac,"I have a brain injury from a car wreck. I have great long term memory, but my short term memory is impaired. This helps so much with exercising my short term memory, and I am a believer that the more you exercise your memory/brain deficits from an injury, the better it may become."
4,JPC2020,I can only play this on my iPhone as the progress doesn‚Äôt sync across devices. Wish I could play in both my iPhone and iPad but they would be at different levels. Is there any way to create an account so that my progress is saved across devices? Thanks
5,chewie.09,I don‚Äôt really like learning but I felt like I had to improve my memory since I get brain fog a lot so I downloaded it and the games are actually pretty fun and addicting I just started it so I‚Äôm not sure on how well it works too much progress wise.
5,vigpoi,"A lot of games and apps like this have apps but they aren‚Äôt skippable and quick. Impulse is free and will meet you to your level and after a few questions, will know what in your brain you want to train. Overall, impulse is really fun and great for your brain."
5,song msg Rico,"This game is the best game to play when you‚Äôre out of school because this game keeps your mind super sharp. When you go back to school everyone will think that you had summer school, but no, it was all from the game that kept your mind on and going."
3,MrsB203,"It‚Äôs only my second day using the app, but I‚Äôve been prompted to leave a review. So far, I like it. The brain training games are engaging, and they don‚Äôt require a significant amount of time to complete. There are many options for additional training games, and I have begun checking those out. After I‚Äôve spent more time with the app, I will return for another review."
5,mee466897876,This app is very user friendly and has 0 ways to scam you or codes you into buying its premium features. It made me want to pay for it. It should go without mention that the app does cavalry what it says it will do.
5,Woo-Hoo21,"Love this new app! I feel my brain getting stronger! So much better than mindless swiping. Took the personality test, after 30 years, I have the same exact personality as the professional test I took way back when. This app is right on!"
5,jayleen!,"This app has been helpful to me so far it helps my brain stay focused and rethink about life. I really love this app,one of my favorite things about this app is that there is this 7 day week game and you play a couple of little mini games to help your mind on focusing."
5,unsweetenedreams,I‚Äôve played a lot of mind games and tried many apps but this one is unbeatable. Not only does it have limitless games for free it also works your brain instead of having kid mind games they‚Äôre actually very sufficient and they keep you entertained ü•∞
4,TheMiddleChild101,To be honest I was pretty dumb and now that i got this app it made me feel smarter of the couple weeks and I‚Äôm going into middle school so this is helping me a lot and I‚Äôm really smart now so I hope  anyone who is reading this please download this app because it‚Äôs really good now anyway I‚Äôm gonna give this 4 stars because it deserves it üëçüèΩ
5,Krakendude,The games here utilize the same style of mental training as an old brain training game I use to play on Nintendo DS called Brain Age. This style has proven effective in improving problem solving and information retention so it already has a pretty solid reputation in my eyes in terms of effective methods of training.
5,Shortred82,"I consider myself a person of pretty high intelligence. Boy, was I wrong when I started playing the games. But - I got better and better. And now I enjoy beating my old scores on some games and tests. The games are explained well, and are really fun to play!!"
5,JazziStar99,I have severe memory problems due to a lifelong seizure disorder and I really think this game is really gonna help me to ‚Äúwork my brain out‚Äù bc like any other muscle the less you use the more you lose! So I‚Äôm very greatful to yal for making these vital brain exercises so fun and easily accessible!!
5,big tuna 84,It‚Äôs a really well structured game that has many levels of play and will absolutely have you thinking a whole lot more at the end of your play. It test different cognitive attributes and I think they did a great job putting this together.
5,Thunder Cat,I am recovering from a a head injury and I‚Äôm trying to exercise my brain in multiple ways to help me with my recovery and though I‚Äôm just getting started I find that this is healthy mixture of exercises though I am growing tired of the Bingo ads every couple seconds.
5,vmartorano,"I already agreed to pay for this app, but after day 5 most of my games were locked unless I started a free trial to upgrade to pro. AS WELL AS making me watch a video before every game if I didn‚Äôt upgrade to pro. This is gross and scummy on the developers behalf. Take your money to Elevate."
5,Simplyfloyd,"Needed something to challenge my brain and this has done the trick so far. Really enjoy the diversity of games and challenges at each level. Also, the self information tests like IQ, ADHD, and other tests come in handy to better understand yourself."
5,Jazik,"I contacted Impulse via email to cancel my subscription. I was then incorrectly charged. I reached out and they thankfully corrected the issue.  I did enjoy the app for a month but lost interest or consistency.   Appreciate the trial period, it was worth a try!"
1,grumpbree,"If you're going to let users have a free trial don't only give them a portion of it. If you want more people to subscribe then let us access the app completely! I was very interested in your app and I took a couple of test. I wanted to see the results but the app wouldn't let me see them until I ""upgraded"" my subscription. I'm doing a free trial you should let me see the results! It's just feels pretty desperate and icky that you don't really honor a free trial."
5,LillyBelle Keller,"I like the blend of learning more about myself along with challenges for things I‚Äôm not so good at combined with things I love to do. If you‚Äôre old enough to remember Highlights, this reminds me of it‚Ä¶multiple layers of interest with fun and functional games to learn and improve with."
5,Manny.L,I downloaded this app as an easier way for me to categorize and maintain my sanity. This app has has been very helpful and keeping me on track and helping me understand myself. It‚Äôs very helpful especially with a discount. Do you apply on there?
5,Nahthissucks100,So I started playing a few days ago to help improve my ADHD shortcomings and I have to say so far so good. Honestly I‚Äôm considering purchasing. The games are pretty fun and I‚Äôve consistently played everyday since I downloaded the app. Will update if I see an improvement on my ADHD.
5,Honest.Human,"Tbh I like this app, it‚Äôs pretty fun that we‚Äôre using an app on our phones just to train our brain for fun instead of scrolling on a social media platform nonstop for hours rotting it. Life‚Äôs too short invest in yourself. But hey don‚Äôt let me tell you what to do. Just do you."
5,Sakonigeimpulse123,"I have an extreme amount of anxiety and I have a feeling that I will be okay when I‚Äôm playing the games in this app. Furthermore, it is a good way for kids and adults like myself( I am a kid of 11 years old) with sensitive brains to get some brainstorming going! Please download this app!!!!!"
3,B.A.G.S,"Im about to delete this app. Now you have to be a premium member or watch ads to do anything. This is a brain game, not a marketing app. I loved this app ever since I got it, but now you can‚Äôt see test results until you pay. I‚Äôm trying to better understand things about myself and i can‚Äôt do it anymore without paying."
5,Kdsksksk,"I feel my brain growing, it‚Äôs so good! And it‚Äôs fun, like it‚Äôs literally games that I can play when i‚Äôm tryna pass time or i‚Äôm like just sitting down bored or something.. I can say the pay is reasonable but that‚Äôs if you really wanna train ur brain fr, if ur not gonna use the app don‚Äôt pay"
5,mz.ajax,"I love Impulse! I'm a puzzle game lover in general, but with Impulse there's also an important purpose. The testing and training are fantastic; it's super interesting to see results and then be able to go and work on improving any areas that might need extra practice."
5,snap@ william1330,Pretty fun deal tell you a lot about yourself you get yourself a free three day trial go ahead and take them up on that offer within your first day they give you a year subscription offer for half off go ahead and did it like $20
2,anniebee81,"The candy sort game was having issues after your last update and I was hopeful this update would fix them. Now it‚Äôs worse! I have two rounds overlayed on top of each other, pressing continue does nothing at the end of the round, the beginning of the round still lags and the final move takes forever to complete because it just sits there. UGH!"
5,Jennyblike,At first I was skeptical so I got the three day trial while playing the game. I guess I got a percentage off for the year. I went ahead and bought it and it‚Äôs actually really helping my daughter focus more and helping her concentrate. It helps me as well. I‚Äôm loving it so far.
5,Reviewsrobert,"This app trains both sides of the brain and you will start to notice improved memory, enhanced decision making skills and precise concentration. The daily games allow you to track a daily streak to monitor your progress and hold you accountable. Download today !"
4,Bluesheep9,I love this app but there are a few ads and I don't want to pay for a subscription.  This is a great app if you have anything mentally that you would like to improve. There isn't many ads but you have to pay for a subscription to view your test results.
5,Slm1126,"I like that it exercises the brain, something you might not think about doing too often. My favorite and the most satisfying part to me is how it compares your scores to others in your age group. It‚Äôs cool to see the results especially if you‚Äôre above average."
5,Blu3_Kn0t,This game keeps my finger and brain firing quickly.  Easy games with the ability to keep me wanting to play more.  Just wish it didn‚Äôt cost anything. After all the ads pop up more then I would like.
2,alexmac30,"Extremely frustrating experience trying to figure out what the app even was or if I wanted to pay for it when every other screen is a pop-up trying to get you to pay immediately. Was trying to enjoy the free trial, but honestly just deleted after 10 mins. Seems like it could be a decent app but I‚Äôve lost interest at this point."
5,Alock86,"I only downloaded this app for the tests I.e. IQ, Trauma brain, etc. but the games are easy to give 5 minutes of your day and are helpful while actually fun. As someone who suffers from depression, this app is something I need to help me with my working memory."
5,KatRemi,"As I‚Äôve gotten older and the career that I‚Äôm in, the attention to detail is the difference between good and greatness.  So far, and I‚Äôm only on my first week, anything that  helps me sharpen & grow my attention to detail is  going to pay it forward."
2,PhillyDude01,"When I want actual mental stimulation, I stick to written puzzles and old fashioned methods. When I want something to train fast hand/eye coordination and suitable for a short attention span, this is it. Puzzles like sudoku give me much more mental stimulation than these quickly timed arcade-like puzzles. I have trouble mustering up enough interest to open this app daily, let alone maintain any type of meaningful streak."
5,RaphaelCash23,"This app was very nicely done. The games are simple yet effective, the tests are the same, and they ask the users for feedback on how to improve. I would recommend this to anybody that wants to improve themselves mentally or learn about how their mind operates"
5,ParkURpolarbear,"I am rehabbing my brain from a TBI, so I have since downloaded and subscribed to and or purchased a hand full of different apps. I must say this is perhaps the most clever and stimulating so far not a bad thing to say about these challenges and games and tests and on and on"
5,C.Lee.S,"It‚Äôs fun, smart, and good for you! I do it in the morning, that way I meet my goal of 10 min a day, which makes me feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something and I start the day with a positive, go get‚Äùem attitude!! It‚Äôs a win-win!"
5,lov3sparks,"At first I was skeptical of this simple game but I wanted to see what it was about. Now I can see! It really does work, this thing‚Äôs legit. I am currently in my free trial but considering yesterday and today I‚Äôm 95% sure I‚Äôm paying for my year. I have until tomorrow to decide"
4,Loafyy,"Overall, the app is amazing. The games are very technical and analytical. I‚Äôm really enjoying myself.   However, the one drawback is the developer has not  created and/or shared any new games. I‚Äôve completed all the levels. If no more games are added, I would have no choice but to delete."
5,Adunnam,I‚Äôve been using this App to help with recovering from a concussion and it is actually helping. Plus it gives amazing detailed information about how you Brain functions it‚Äôs strength and weaknesses. I recommend for everyone!
4,Dancerfromsamoa,"This app exercises remind me of those mental puzzles and I was happy to finally find an app that can at least match that quality. I just don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs subscription based. I know that it sounds slightly hypocritical considering that I own brain age, but that‚Äôs a one time non reoccurring investment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm just picky that way."
4,IndicaSativacorn,Way over rated and a pompously over flaunted app since a fat lot of good it does when it wants $4.99 per ‚Äúreport‚Äù or $6.99 weekly just to let you read your test results. No thanks. I can get more accurate and actual psychological test parameters for free from the books these ‚Äútests‚Äù are based off of.
5,MJH55,"This is great how it targets selective areas to work on (ie memory, attention, etc). Haven‚Äôt seen this targeted approach in other brain-building apps! And you can select the amount of time spent brain-training per day. Only down side is that you have to pay."
5,calebslostjournal,"It is a great game. Unlike other things in life, it is 100% accurate. If you get it wrong you get it wrong. If you get it right, well then you get it right. It keeps my brain moving while I am off this semester from college."
5,maleficent10152003,I love using this in the morning. It‚Äôs a great way to start the day and wake your brain up. Sure there‚Äôs an ad every few game rounds but after a few seconds you can leave the ad. Definitely worth the ads
5,Geneticsleuth,I did not have a comparison of my brain acuity against that if my peers until I began using this app.  I see some areas where I have slipped a bit in speed and realize these are the areas I need to work on.  This app gives me the tools to do so.
5,TeoTheLostBoy.,"So far I‚Äôm on the free trial and it seems like it‚Äôs fun for all ages, easy to understand when it comes to the trial and discounts and it‚Äôs just overall a well put together app. I‚Äôm definitely going to recommend this to folks. Can‚Äôt afford the app rn but I‚Äôll get back to it lol"
5,Mrs.Rabbit24,"My husband loves theses types of apps and was using elevate but it was too ‚Äúbig brained‚Äù for me , felt like I was taking too long on some games but this one is so fun, it has small tests to learn more about yourself like your IQ, personality type and more. Great was to pass the time and exercise your brain"
5,Katherina_Scorpio,"Impulse is absolutely amazing! You can test you brain to see how smart you are. And not just that, you can also use impulse to help you develop your brain even more! My grades in school went from B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs, to straight A‚Äôs! So download impulse right now!"
5,Snaucy,"I like it more than other apps of this kind. Not sure if it's actual brain traininG, but it does keep me alert while I'm using it, and I feel that it's better / more interesting than other types of games."
5,Bonitabella617,Instead of staring at Facebook or Instagram this is a great way to keep your mind sharp. Memory is something I struggle with now so this game definitely will help & also with my math skills since I‚Äôve always been lousy doing math in my head. I highly recommend this app!!!
5,Federico Fast,"Very well designed games and exercises. They push you, intrigue you, challenge you and ‚Äústress you out‚Äù in a good way. I am enjoying every session thus far and Look forward to ‚Äúthat‚Äù time of the day when I put my brain to the daily test!"
5,Buddy killer 2000,I don‚Äôt have the pro features and this is one of the only games where the normal version is just as good as pro!   Very useful to improve your training and this is absolutely the best option. Must have and highly recommended
5,asyd2020,"You have to pay to play this game, I suggest the life time membership. One and done. Besides that, I have been playing this for the past two days and I feel like I‚Äôm quicker and I feel more than refreshed. This game is just a bunch of brain food and I love it!"
5,19TwD86,"This is what ‚Äúgames‚Äù our children and youth should focus on. Being on a phone could be somewhat healthier with these sort of games. Personally since playing this game for 5-15mins a day I feel sharper mentally, it‚Äôs like a gym session for one‚Äôs mind and people of all ages should try!"
5,be goid,"I like this app, but the problem is that people can bother you or try to talk to you. How can you answer them back? That wastes some time on my IQ test. People might think we‚Äôre ignoring them! I think there should be a pause bottom. The app works like it says."
5,Kjmac90,Impulse is a great app to wake up and wind down with everyday. Using the app when I wake up helps me to start my work day more smoothly and using it when I wind down at night helps me sleep better if my day wasn‚Äôt as busy or productive as normal.
5,dbobby,"Impulse is a fast and fun way to wake your brain up. I‚Äôm finding what I really excel at and areas where I struggle, which is interesting.  The puzzles combined with fun, relaxing games provide me some enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment.   I look forward to maintaining my daily streak."
5,Ugjrer,I‚Äôve only played once. There were three different games that weren‚Äôt too long or boring.   I was excited when I completed the game and looked forward to the next training game.  I look forward to tomorrow‚Äôs adventure.
3,Nicks Review Impulse,"I paid for the 1 time purchase to remove ads, it was like $4.99. The game then went without ads for a couple days, then showed ads again, it then stopped and now it‚Äôs showing all the ads again when I already paid to remove them. Kinda annoying. The app is great though and I enjoy it a lot"
5,Neo-Fruedian,I‚Äôve deleted TikTok and other entertainment apps entirely while using this app solely. I‚Äôve noticed an improvement in my ability to remember as well as the ability to make critical decisions faster.
5,Pmj2024,This app is exactly what I needed to work on my concentration because of my ADHD. I love that it reminds me to do some brain games to get my  morning started cause I would just be going about my day without remembering to start my day with a brain exercise
5,BG >:),"The games aren‚Äôt boring, and not too easy or too difficult. After a few lessons I feel my brain fatigue, and know I‚Äôm getting smarter! If you‚Äôre deciding whether to get it or not, I would definitely recommend you download it."
5,Chelsea.Rae.,"I find that I really enjoy playing impulse games because they are so versatile and always keep my brain engaged. The challenges they present are really beneficial for improving my memory and knowledge, which is something I appreciate."
1,Laila Veronez,"I subscribe to try it free and do not used it enough to make sense to pay then I‚Äôm trying to cancel the subscription before change me but there is no option to cancel anywhere, don‚Äôt even show up as a subscription at my Apple account, just changed on my card and I can‚Äôt even have a email to request e the cancellation. That‚Äôs so bad that‚Äôs a scan situation, I hope that with that comment you guys come up with my money bad and the cancellation"
5,Jahaan59,"In just a few short minutes of training, I enjoyed the challenges, and wanted to continue. I found this training relaxing and exciting at the same time. I love it! Thanks for thinking about our mental compacity!  üòÅ"
4,KarenluvsKev,"This app is great and has helped a lot with my attention span and other things like that, buuuuuuut, there are WAY too many ads. After every round you play, there's an ad. I get the at you have to put in ads to pay for your things,  but it's getting annoying. Super cool game tho!!"
4,G.Arie,"I‚Äôve just downloaded this app yesterday. Paid for the subscription and I logged in today to complete my streak and every time I open the app, it loads and then shuts down numerous times. Will I be able to get a refund if I uninstall the app and cancel subscription?"
5,landon Witherspoon,Impulse is realy fun! I play it every night I‚Äôve gotten a lot smarter my favorite game is the sorting game I would like you to make more of them I hope you do and it would be so fun if you could make a color number game too! End of reply.
5,The OG Crip,"I like to play it in the morning before school, it wakes me up a little. I wish there was more available in the free version but i definitely enjoy the daily training, even the math part can be a little fun too sometimes ü§ì"
5,X-tmi-X,"I Am enjoying using having a way to sharpen and entertain myself, by myself ü§≠. Consistency, that‚Äôsss what I need when I sign up only life has been faithful in arriving with ‚Äútrouble enough of it‚Äôs own‚Äù  I will return as often as allowed by this Foster Mom‚Äù of four in training ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,Shut shutup,Starts off easy then slowly takes you up and before you know it you‚Äôre remembering things and that‚Äôs a great feeling when you thought things weren‚Äôt going right with your memory ! Games are fun too!!
5,stenkely,Keeps me thinking and working in several areas of mental practice.  I make sure to complete each day and not skip over hard ones!  Takes very little time and results are obvious in my daily life.
5,Goochie poochie,"For those of us who need to work out our brain muscles this Game definitely accomplishes that! It also helps me when I need a brain break so I can have an extended period of focus. I stop what I‚Äôm doing, play a few rounds and then get back to work!"
5,Ingrid Stephania,It is fun to prove your own brain skills into a few seconds and train them everyday through different exercises! It shows you statistics of your position related to all players üíê. Sadly some of the adds are uncomfortable not appropriate üòì.
5,moovweight,Refreshing take on brain training and if you‚Äôre doing it just for the daily help and not needing access to the entire platform you can do so with no membership. But the app will have skippable ads for the free version.
5,Fanciio,"I love this brain training game. Makes you think, without really exhausting yourself! Fun fun fun. My husband has this also downloaded on his phone and we compete in scoring."
2,Anniejo33,"Has a 3 day trial that claims you can unlock all features without ads,  but any ‚Äútest‚Äù results are locked unless you fully commit to purchasing some form of subscription. So no, free trial to a waste of time essentially. Otherwise I‚Äôm sure the app does what it says but those red flags say ‚Äúgive me money‚Äù only and I get this thing wants to make a profit but hard pass on that."
5,estrewcrt,"This game really helped my improve my mental math skills, and it was fun learning! I love all of the games on this app and There‚Äôs also tons of fun quizzes to determine your brain type, IQ etc. only thing, maybe make a bit more available for non premium users."
5,Philipp Ti,"Rather than you scrolling your life away, get this app. It costs like one coffee a week, or $40 a year which is $.77 a week! Trains your brain and keep you focused! Thank you Impulse. P.S. Saw ad for this app on Facebook, 15min later I deleted Facebook üòÇ"
5,No 82,I like how this app exercises so many different parts of the brain. As you get older it hard to stay as sharp and sometimes your in medications that don‚Äôt help that. I‚Äôm hoping this helps me and so far I‚Äôm really liking it
5,Audreyh.,"i love playing these mind strengthening games, i enjoy the challenge and also i enjoy seeing how well my brain is working after all these years. you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre working because of how fun the games are!"
5,RiaynnsMommy,This app is good so far! I like how the games allow you to use different parts of your brain that you don‚Äôt really use daily! Allows you to think outside the box and be a kid again! I love doing this for 5-10 mins a day to refocus!
5,Corey2482,"I really enjoy this app! I had a head injury a little bit ago and this app is really helping me with my short term memory. I play everyday for about 10-15 mins and I‚Äôm really noticing a lot of improvements. Also, I‚Äôm loving the personality tests you can take for fun!! Great app!"
5,Homicidesquad,"This is an amazing app that helps grow your brain in many different ways. I recommend this app for anyone that wants to improve the way your brain solves (math) problems, stores memory, and see‚Äôs order of operations.  -Definitely 5 Stars for this app."
1,player1587,"I was charged for an entire year of subscription after two days of my three day trial period. On top of that the information given said 6.99 per week unless cancelled, not a year at once. AND the app gifted me 90% off and never reflected that in the payment it took out early. I am now in the process of requesting a refund. I feel like this is a scam hoping people will say ‚Äúoh well it‚Äôs only 30 bucks, I‚Äôll just cancel now and not fight it.‚Äù Highly unethical."
5,Fun brain games- but costs,I really like the games. They are fun and makes my brain work quick. I don‚Äôt like that I have to pay for it. I‚Äôve been able to play a few games without paying but that won‚Äôt last long I‚Äôm sure.
5,Chiver476,"I do enjoy the mental games that are given on this app. They do make you think critically and subjectively. Even though I don‚Äôt get them all correctly, it‚Äôs great engaging my mind on these games to hopefully help keep my mind as sharp as possible. Thx"
5,Fvfvgvfvg,"Love this app so much. I think it‚Äôs worth the yearly subscription, because it promotes self improvement each day. There‚Äôs many games and challenges. It‚Äôs also cool to see how you did compared to your peers. Definitely recommend!!"
1,ScamAppDetector,"Want to open the app? Pay for a plan. Want to try out the app after signing up for subscription? No problem, go ahead, but after you take one of the personality tests you need to sign up for another, different, more costly subscription or do another one time payment to get your results ON TOP OF your current subscription and trial. The predatory model and dark patterns this app uses is everything wrong with the state of apps at the moment. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
5,CelestialHope15,"Impulse is much better than what I thought it would be! I really like it because of the exercises it has, I use the app in the morning when I‚Äôm still feeling tired and lazy and it wakes up my brain right away. Recommend 100% !!!"
1,jen8967,"Signed up for a 3 day ‚Äúunlimited access‚Äù trial just to find out that it won‚Äôt even give test results without a paid subscription. For that reason alone, I‚Äôm out.    Update to dev response: when you have an ‚Äúunlimited access trial‚Äù the assumption is that you have full access to the results. The trial is a preview of what you would have if you pay. Why would I pay when the ‚Äúunlimited access trial‚Äù is limited? Maybe update how you advertise that."
5,406emmies,It‚Äôs pretty cool.  I like to see how fast my brain can work . See how smart I am .  I like the challenge. I‚Äôve been doing it in the morning to see what my skills are like compared to night time .  I get better and better the more I play .  Thank you !
5,2142 to 28,I was finding that in down time all I did was doom scroll. I lost time and became more distracted. This has been outstanding. It gives me down time in a way that is keeping my cognitive skills intact and growing.
2,L3701!!,"The app content is great and interesting but be careful about the hidden costs! When it asked if I wanted ads to be removed, I paid the additional amount for no ads. However, that only removed ads for that single game within the app, not for the entire app. That was not explained and I was very disappointed after I paid for no ads to see ads continually come up while using the app."
5,Gray'sMom,"Many interesting games, puzzles, and challenges to build brain cells. It‚Äôs not as easy as I thought it would be. I hope I improve. This thing keeps track of your progress so we will see how it goes."
5,Horbanga,Download this game and played a few rounds. I enjoy the few rounds that I played and then was prompted with an opportunity for a discount. That discount allowed me to get a yearly subscription for a very good deal. after playing it for a few days I‚Äôm really enjoying it.
5,yvarzideh26,I love waking up and doing my ‚Äúdaily exercises‚Äù. It keeps my focus attention and cognition sharp while also waking me up and being fun too! There are many types of games and many levels. It knows what I need and I love that!
5,arsenal.was.taken,"I don‚Äôt know how accurate the iq tests and other tests are but its very fun to do. Even the default version is good, you can upgrade but you don‚Äôt have to. You still get everything without upgrading, you just have to wait. Its a very good app, and I don‚Äôt regret upgrading."
1,CaptainFootnotes,"It is reasonable to expect that the sample portion of an app includes at least SOME of the many tests you promote in your many, many ads. Sadly, this is not the case. In order to get any meaningful results from any quiz, you have to pony up with the cash. You might get a subscription out of me if you really let me try it first - but with all of these fake outs? No way.  IMHO, this is scammy and deceptive. (This review is based upon the MANY tries I‚Äôve given the app based on different ads FEATURING different tests)."
5,kaelyn88,Feel much better spending time on this than social media. I‚Äôm often over using  my phone after playing a couple rounds and have seen my screen time go down.
5,Fresh Pockets,Honestly I love these games quizzes puzzles I felt like I needed more mental stimulation in my life been using impulse for about a month and I‚Äôve seen a dramatic improvement in day to day interactions and simply remembering things focusing at work or just in a conversation
5,TryTrue,"Post the virus, I‚Äôve been struggling with brain fog and mental acuity. I saw this app and thought I would give it a shot. I‚Äôve only been using it for about a week, and I already see a different. I cannot say enough great things about this app."
5,Vols06,There are so many games to play that helps me focus and get ready for the day. Something I actually enjoy doing as well as seeing a benefit in my concentration and remove that morning fogginess. Highly recommend!
4,Greenrqt1229;),I really like the app but the stuff that I am interested in and things that will actually get your brain going more than the others cost money and I feel that when you are trying to increase you knowledge it should not have a price but I like the app and I do recommend it
5,Maggielove29,On the daily it‚Äôs easy to go in Instagram or other dating apps when I go on this app it makes me feel like I‚Äôm accomplishing more then just swiping down watching every ones life. I love a challenge and this app makes me think I absolutely love this app!
1,Crackalacka2690,"Reviews are obviously bought and paid for. This app is all about ads, ads, ads!! Need I say more‚Ä¶  Update: the developer responded and basically confirmed my review.  Their app is so riddled with ads it is unusable.  It‚Äôs obviously an app that is built around ads and not an app that adds ads to help support their development.  This is the kind of garbage that apple shouldn‚Äôt allow here.  All it does is dilute the App Store for the developers who actually make good products.  I stand by my review. The app is garbage."
3,Qtmariya,I like the games‚Ä¶.when I finally get to them.  I can‚Äôt even play a couple games to see how much I like them without 10 mins of ads that you can‚Äôt skip.  You should be able to play for a little while and THEN start getting the ads in order to upgrade and keep playing.  Makes me not even want to play.
5,Tycoon Tyme,"Lots of different games, puzzles and fun/engaging activities. IQ test are interesting also. Only thing I don‚Äôt care for is the amount of ads but they aren‚Äôt too bad most are skippable and they never interfere during the middle of actual programs."
5,Lacey Rhodes,"I suffer from various mental health issues, and it has caused cognitive deficits. I have been meaning to find an app that works on every part of my brain, and I feel impulse does a great job activating those areas of my brain I haven‚Äôt used in a while. Thanks impulse!"
5,Sharrod375,This three easy task a day on the free version has helped me to start forming a habit which I love the games are simple and ones you could find anywhere so much more helpful then regular games but it‚Äôs nice.
5,SOS-TPA,A great way to train the brain starting from basics. We tend to forget the foundation because we think we need to have extremely difficult training and we don‚Äôt. The best way to retrain is to start with basics like Impulse provides.
5,Numbnugs,Genetic predisposition to Dementia/Alzhiemers.. was already working on some brain games.. which were/are helping ‚Ä¶ along with a couple of supplements like ginko biloba.. borderline adhd/hypoglycemic both‚Ä¶ managed via Diet‚Ä¶day5 since my LAST soft drink‚Ä¶    I love that this is focused on exactly what I Need.. I have things to Do‚Ä¶   ;{)
5,TallyGirl85,I down loaded this app a while back and it still allows me to use it for free. It doesn‚Äôt give you all of the training options of the paid version but the training it does offer is not bad.
5,üôÇGüòç,"It was crazy how it has helps me. I normally do it before work to improve my focus. Also, I got a bump in my head from a fall. My quickness has gone down, but it goes up a bit every day."
5,Hello kitty_2,An amazing game I‚Äôve been loving the feedback but one thing I don‚Äôt think is exactly ideal is that when you take a test for like personality or something else you can‚Äôt see the detailed results unless you have premium.
5,Derek Costa Rica,I stumble upon this app and I found it most amusing and the exercise are and different help changing the set of mind during the day and not deconcentrate myself. So I enjoy it once twice three times a day. Good job everyone have fun and muscle this brain.
2,Jammie F,"Did the trial and found it to be somewhat challenging. Puzzles are easy to accomplish while watching TV. Found it way too costly, so decided to go with the free version. MY GOD- THE ADVERTISING!! there were so many adds you can‚Äôt even engage with the app. You literally watch more advertising than playing the game. I attempted twice after the free trial- absolutely couldn‚Äôt get through the advertising and just deleted it."
3,Cranjis McBasketballZ,"Another one of those apps that coerce you into purchasing a premium plan due to bombarding you with ads the entire time. Even in the MIDDLE of memory exercises to train your brain, which factually-based: defeats the purpose lol. It‚Äôs a great concept, but you can‚Äôt get through things without something cutting you off to show you a matching game ad."
5,dr3w214,"Typical 40 year old southerner, who has recently found an abundance of free time. Figured I‚Äôd go ahead and educate myself, and these ‚Äòbrain game‚Äô type apps are very beneficial. So far this is the most fun and, well put together app I‚Äôve experienced."
5,LogicMF,I‚Äôve only played a few games but I really enjoy it so far. The graphics are eye-catching and intriguing the games so far have been a little bit simple but I‚Äôm hoping they start to get more complex as I go through the app.
5,geeenjuh,These are the exact games they used in the testing process for measurement of my brain tumor resection progress. I know these games help keep me scoring high after my surgery. I had a grade 2 frontal lobe tumor removed and I‚Äôm so happy to see how well I‚Äôm doing post-op.
5,Kellypufff,I like the break from social scrolling apps and replace it with some fun and quick brain training games you can really do anywhere at any time! Whether on break at work or at home looking for something to do!
1,Finerflower,"This app advertises lots of tests that this app allegedly has on Facebook ads. However, when you open the app to look for the test or assessment, it isn‚Äôt available. These tests revolve around ‚Äúwhat is your childhood trauma style ‚Äú etc, so I think the company is directly preying on folks going through a tough time. If the developer are advertising a specific test, the least they should do is have that advertised assessment available to the user on their app."
4,Samoss61432,"The games are great, I do 10 minutes a day they have like three different games, so it‚Äôs cool, and it helps u practice focus only thing that‚Äôs annoying is that they will give you some things and then ask you to pay for them at that which is annoying"
5,El Toast-O,"Today my brain farted. Not in the usual way a brain farts, but a good one! One that farts rainbows like mine just did after playing this for 15min. You definitely want your brain to fart just like mine did so go download this app today!!!!"
2,Tayvianfox,"The app itself seems great, I see it helps many people with dealing with their mental health and finding out about themselves. However, you do have to pay for literally everything on the app. I downloaded it because I wanted to take the tests and se my results but in order to do so, I must pay a monthly subscription. Would be great if that weren‚Äôt the case."
5,div truck 1,"It would be fine if it was a one time purchase for a few bucks, but I‚Äôm not paying a monthly fee to play this game‚Ä¶ I can literally play the same game with real cards if I buy a game from target under $20"
5,MalickMan,This training has made me more conscious of finer details of life. I pay more attention to the little things and that makes a big difference. I rarely miss a day and it has become part of my daily routine.
5,Suzeeque31,"So far, this is only day 2, I am enjoying this app.  I find it helpful to train my brain especially as I feel a lot more foggy lately.  I am hoping this app can provide me some insights as it helps me improve my focus and relieves some pent up anxiety."
1,KitKat5683,The app doesn‚Äôt even give you a chance to look around it just immediately wants your money. I would get it if it was like you have a day or two to look around but then we‚Äôll charge you but nope just answer 10 questions and pay. Or maybe if it was like these things are off limits but you can see a couple things as a trail but nope. Download this app if you want to pay for test you get free online.
3,Nathan Melton,The games and the test are really cool. There‚Äôs a really good idea behind the app the only problem is that you have to pay to see your test scores. It would be nice to at least get one free so I know if the report I'm going to get is worth paying for. Highly reccomend if you‚Äôre willing to pay but if your not maybe stick to the free test on google.
5,IG Joegotthejuice__,"It‚Äôs an app that for lack of better words is mind numbing, it takes your mind off the stress of reality and puts your knowledge that you already have stored in your brain to the test! Love it already and only used it twice."
5,D-Darby,You compete to outdo or better yourself. It is fun but also entertaining. I am always happy to pick it up and play while able to challenge myself.I can compare myself to others in my age group as well.
5,jamyeee,"I‚Äôm naturally a competitive person. These games will bring that out of you! But, in the best way. It makes you want to do better and improve. It‚Äôs easy to understand your scoring and areas of focus. Loving it so far. Worth it."
5,$talk,"I've only been doing the exercises a few days so I can't comment on their efficacy, but I do know I enjoy doing them. I like the variety of tasks focusing on different areas of the brain so it's really doesn't get boring."
5,Karol Lisa,"I‚Äôm really enjoying my daily challenges :).  At age 62, and retired, I worry that my brain is going to slow down.  With the challenges, and the IQ tests, I can feel good that my brain still works pretty darn good.  Hoping that with daily challenges, it‚Äôll stay that way."
5,Navi‚Äôs Mom,This app is great for me to engage with each day. The app provides simple and short instructions and the games get more challenging as I continue to play. I also like how the game gives me a score which encourages me to do better next time!!  Susan
5,alexis_92,I have adhd and this has helped me realize that I am smarter than my intrusive thoughts have let me believe. I‚Äôm training my brain with fun games that get progressively harder as you go. Making it both a lot of fun and a good tool to easily get better faster
5,stellRoseüåπ,"It‚Äôs your choice to pay and receive more brain games but I didn‚Äôt and Still like the ones they send me to do, some are easy some are challenging but that‚Äôs the point and I love it, so helpful."
5,BlueEyedBritt,"I have the free version and love it so much I might actually spend some money on this one! I love the way it makes me challenge myself and I can see my results! I‚Äôm not really competing with another person, just bettering myself without the pressure! üôÇ"
5,Big JMC Daddy,This is an outstanding training app for brain like mine which are aging but still need to stay sharp. I‚Äôve noticed a difference quickly with how sharp my brain is since starting this training
5,KatieHope88,I am a bit addicted to this. I am enjoying it and I feel accomplished. It‚Äôs much better than social media and it‚Äôs a feeling of satisfaction each time I get to a new level! Highly recommend it.
1,Mjc1031,"I am deleting this game now. The games available are ok but you can only play three of the better games a day without paying, the rest of the games are not very good. And to top it off you have to watch an ad before each game, that‚Äôs right one twenty second game then a video from 30 seconds to two minutes. It‚Äôs actually ridiculous I have never had a game with so many long ads for very little gameplay. Like I said I am deleting the game now."
5,Baddietykierra,I like it because you will have something to do when your mom tell you to do some work. You will have something to do when you bored if you trying to do a pop quiz on your brain
5,b_b_~_~,"You do have to pay like a fee like if you actually want to go continuously keep improving. I mean if your paying money on it might as well play it. This game actually makes me feel very smart, and knowing I can do it(:"
5,SplitPotNot,The ability to focus your thoughts or keep them at bay to achieve each mini goal becomes a true test of your mental agility! Great tracking tool for your thinking improvements! A purposeful use of time in stark contrast to the mindless social media apps!
2,Rissdyan,"I have two different brain injury's. This last year has been a complete fog. I am using impulse to see where my cognitive deficits are and to help retrain my brain. I do very short sessions for now, I can feel the brain fatigue pretty quickly.  I enjoyed the free trial. Canceled and deleted app but was still charged $40 with no way to get a refund. I guess be very careful when the trial runs out. A lot of nothing for an app I don't have."
4,‚úãüèºüóøü§öüèº,"I‚Äôve only used the app for two days so I don‚Äôt have much to say on the app but so far it‚Äôs not bad, I saw as I think the most used or highest rated app for its category, something in the respect but the app is pleasant to look and and fun to use, I hope I get to write more as I used the app more but so far it‚Äôs really good."
3,homewiththehoopers,I have really been enjoying this app and due to budget was using the free version. The adds started off fine and then one came up that HIGHLY inappropriate and sexual in nature. Thank goodness I was playing and not my children. I am extremely disappointed that an app rated for 4+ and to exercise your brain would show such deplorable ads.
5,_silentprincess,"Impulse is so relaxing and I really mean it. Without paying a thing you can play so many of their stress relieving, brain sharpening games such as candy sorting, worlds, word searches, and the every day excersizes are so extremely fun. Definitely recommend this game :)"
5,J.Joanne,"I like the different features like brain games, puzzles, quizzes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just a few games but a whole lot more. I also like that it shows how you rank in comparison to your age group in terms of the games."
5,Hitori_Samishiku,"occasionally freezes right after I complete a game. I have to restart the app to bypass it. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a nice app with nice games. Not sure if I would pay a subscription though.  Edit: Now seems to work good and more reliable to play!"
5,LilNikki70923,"I really like this app. It‚Äôs fun and really creative, it flows well and the content is helpful to see how you‚Äôre doing. Worth the money, I think, so definitely better than those cash games that are also fun and don‚Äôt have advertisements."
1,gtangjr,"The app recommends you stay off social media, but it's designed in every way to be the most aggressive, misleading, disgusting dopamine drip possible. This app does nothing for your brain. All it does is give them more and more information about how to manipulate you into playing longer and paying more. You want to train your brain? Try reading a book without giving up in two minutes to check your phone for more easy wins."
5,Shyteisha,"Me and my little sister is tackling at the impulse brain games to be better to think instead of instantly doing or thinking we know the correct answer, think before you do, not do before you think"
5,K√†l,The app is really good so far not sure if it‚Äôs because I paid but it‚Äôs really worth the money I know they was a free version but that didn‚Äôt offer much same as other apps but I don‚Äôt regret paying and I love the IQ and other personality tests and everything.
5,jay ferriss,"I wish they unlocked more games with out having to pay but other than that it‚Äôs fun and involves learning, would be great for kids if you don‚Äôt fully like them on video games but still like this kind of stuff"
5,Tessellation68,"It is always a good practice to challenge your brain to improve its function. These games do just that. They start you out at a training level and slowly increase in difficulty as you play. Perfect for people, like me, who aren‚Äôt gamers."
5,tessakchick,And it can be a 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è in your life too! If your like me which we are all more alike than you and I may know üåéü´∂üèº starving for more clarity and memory space for our üß† then this app is a MUST HAVE! props to the makers of this wonderful and very time worthy app üëèüèºü•≥üí™üèº
5,Nickname_is_taken_831,You ever download a game but it‚Äôs not what you expected because the ad was completely click bate. Well no need to worry these puzzles will make you think or help you relax with many different types of moods to choose from to suit how your feeling
5,blissfulmorning,I love impulse because it makes me feel relaxed and productive at the same time. I like being able to see my improvement in areas and it helps me have fun with my competitive side (just competing against myself). I also love that impulse has personality tests!
5,P1nk422,"I enjoy this app so much, because these are simple games, yet keep you intrigued & motivated. There are so many to choose from and I don‚Äôt feel so lazy when I choose to play these games, as I would others. My daughter loves this app too"
5,blimblimblizzard123,On a whim I decided to give impulse a try! I‚Äôm 38 and feel like my brain could definitely use ‚Äú an oil change‚Äù lol. I haven‚Äôt been doing it very long yet but I find the games to be challenging but also fun and I keep going back to play on my free time..so glad I gave it a try!
5,Woo$,"It help‚Äôs your brain keep moving. As we get older, and things slow down, how fast you run, heal, and move around all together. Your mind will be the only thing moving at the speed if not faster all because of impulse"
5,StaceyyyRanaaaaaa,This app has helped me improve my memory (so far) & I suffer from memory loss from being a kid & some man put muscle relaxers in my soda that cause me many many problems related to my memoryüòîso if you‚Äôre looking for a app to help you gain your memory back slowly this IS the app for YOUüôåüëçüëè
5,lunaglo,I find myself waiting in line for my children at school for long periods of time‚Äî I have started using that time to engage my brain and electrify synapses that haven‚Äôt been electrified  in years. I used to listen to my murder podcasts - it‚Äôs a nice switch.
5,LilMama 042205,It was recommended that I do some Nuroplasticity (rewiring the brain) so I decided to look up some brain games to help me. This is literally my only seconded day doing it definitely can see all my weaknesses but truly believe if you stay committed-good things can happen
5,ClintLeonard,I used to be so good at these games but now at 53 I find I need to do these more often in order to maintain what I consider successful for myself.  I definitely find it. They help in my daily decision-making and thought process.
1,Dom777777777898,"Makes you pay to do anything and says you can cancel writhing 6 days but just went to cancel and it won‚Äôt let me. Says I have it for the year (just downloaded today and tried cancelling the subscription). And the tests are just simple personality test type things, don‚Äôt seem science based (IQ was just shapes and think they give you higher ratings I think just to make you stay active on the app [I‚Äôm in the 96th percentile but am not that smart])"
4,Lau218,Some levels in the candy drop game don‚Äôt register as being completed. You can‚Äôt go ahead until you‚Äôve completed the previous level. I‚Äôm up to level 1878 but it keeps bumping me back to 1608 with many levels in between unchecked.
5,za4life,Following a recent traumatic brain injury I found this very helpful on strengthening the mind. The quizzes were easy enough to navigate considering my condition being fun at the same time. The mind is a mysterious thing and these quizzes. Let you know your progression.
2,Chellbellzy75,"It‚Äôs a shame how I think I have come across a app that will help me out, to find out it‚Äôs got to be a fee of some sort. I understand that nothing but Salvation is the only thing that is free in life. But for once it would‚Äôve been nice to experience a real app that‚Äôs truly trying to help people not make me feel worse cause I can‚Äôt afford to pay something as small as 6 or 7 dollars. Thanks anywho"
5,~Neshaaa~,"I like impulse it really fun , simple and easy to do , it fun in so many ways like the games are fun to play , it breaks things down for you to see where you really at and trying to achieve by playing the game and using the app which I find really cool."
5,Chippset,Though new to the app I really appreciate the variety of activities and the tutorial before each one. It feels more educational than many of the other brain improving apps I‚Äôve tried.
5,Qizaboss,I have been playing this game only for a couple of days now but I am convinced that it will help my cousin with issues he has since his 2 strokes. It seems to be able to help him improve his memory and cognitive skills.
5,Gerlach 13,"Im still new but can tell these games will help  Cognitive slipping . Challenging puzzles but simple format. They also have a daily reminder to keep going, and if you miss a day training, you go back to step one! Pretty clever."
5,MikiEgb,This app is giving me a routine and a way to wake up my mind first thing in the morning rather than scrolling through social media and going down a rabbit hole where I find myself wasting time and brain cells.
4,country girl review,As everything in this world this game cost money! You do get a 3 day trial however during the 3 days you cannot see the results of things unless you pick the payment option. Games seem pretty cool so far only been at it for couple hours in total
5,Vampshh,"Great App, all the games get you engaged and they make it fun by comparing your results to other people. I haven‚Äôt been using the app long but the app definitely pointed out what I need help with and how to improve. Everyone should try this"
5,MusicalMixin,Life. Take the good handle the bad. I life with a TBI and have used brain games as my morning routine for years. I enjoy most but impulse has a spectacular variety of games!   I will use for years but I know it benefits me with my situation and would for everyone.
4,Jb2004123,Gives you your own goals to beat as well as improving against others. The personality tests that were described in the ad weren‚Äôt as expected and I don‚Äôt even think they‚Äôre all there. Would be nice to have new games added as you progress. But I enjoy doing it regardless
5,Samie123021,I worked as a health care worker and I have observed at a certain age we begin to loose our ability to think critically our in other words memory loss. This app has challenged me to level up my skills and thinking abilities
5,Siciliangirl50,During my down time during the day I play fun games to help with my memory and exercise my brain. I have times that are challenging but that is why I like impulse. I feel if I do this everyday I have accomplished something good for my health
5,Neverstoplearning111,"I really enjoy sharpening my mental skills. They always say, if you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it. Keep your memory and mental agility heightened by using impulse. Also, it satisfies my instant gratification receptors by allowing me to succeed at least three times per day!"
5,mmart44,Games vary in difficulty and in activity. Helps to keep brain working away to maintain an alert mind. Recommend to people who want a break from just using phone for social media or videos.
1,tklausner,Brain training is fine but I also more spend time with the crossword puzzle game. Before the update I had 3 chances for 3 letters during each puzzle if I got stuck. NOW those 3 chances have disappeared and NOW have to watch some stupid ad for a game that never existed before if I want a try at a letter!! Why would you do that? That nice little luxury being taken away will make me quit the entire Impulse. That‚Äôs not an appropriate update!!
2,PSA246810,"Stay away it‚Äôs just a big marketing scam.  There is very little brain training in this app. You get 3 quick games, then it pushes you to other regular puzzles. There is constant ads for other games that you are forced to watch. The more you play, the longer ads are. They are really trying to push you to buy the ad free version that has a monthly fee."
5,DanitheHappyOne,Since I‚Äôve been playing these games my concentration has improved and my memory seems better! I‚Äôm actually winning once in a while at memory games with my grandkids!
5,Sosynken6,"This is noticeably helpful with brain function. I think faster and more clearly during and after and its AWESOME! I would totally recommend it for people (like me) that struggle with being passive or procrastination, with a more ‚Äútired‚Äù or ‚Äúunsure‚Äù brain. Helps a lot!"
5,Madlove9,"I love this stuff, especially the math since it‚Äôs easy to forget math skills, and I find I have to practice them to hold onto them. It‚Äôs just like summer vacation when I was a kid, come Fall it would be back to the beginning no matter how good I was at math."
5,Jp775478&,"I feel smarter already but I‚Äôm not sure if I really need this since the first quiz I was 90%, the second 98% and the third was 99%. ‚ÄúMr Smartypants over there‚Äù but get this I‚Äôm ADD, OCD, Dyslexic, and barely scraped by to graduate high school with a D average. I don‚Äôt test well and I have CRS: I Can‚Äôt Remember Shi‚Ä¶.Stuff"
5,Annieruthlillieann,"I love this app for the variety of practice exercises, tests, and more. It‚Äôs a fun app, but it also helps you focus, concentrate, and work on your memory. I highly recommend it. It is intelligent and well thought out."
5,Graycen cadenhead,Impulse has so many fun games to play when I get stress I play impulse it releases stress from your body and has lots of fun enjoyable games for you to play so try playing impulse today you never know if you like it or not download today and get started.
5,JesusBassGuitarChick,"My mother has Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. It runs in the family. I am really enjoying these fun games in hopes to keep my mind sharp while I‚Äôm young-ish. üòÅ     50 years old, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try! I got the lifetime app so I won‚Äôt have to worry about renewing again, and I am happy I did,"
5,CatDoveLoves,The games are easy to understand and there fast. I love how many different options there are per day that change to test your skills and grow your brain power.
5,gracekelone,"The games are very enjoyable and are as challenging as you want them to be. Most of the content is free, so even without paying you will get a lot out of this game. The training games actually make you use your brain, which is awesome :)"
5,fluer-de-li,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed the challenges thus far from Impulse. My memory is exercised in a way that makes it entertaining for me. I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to grow bored, which is a huge plus. I wish I had played sooner. Great game!"
5,HopelessRomntc69,"It sharpens you for sure. I had my doubts but after using it for a day I saw how quickly my brain was able to connect things a lot faster and, I already thought I was pretty fast, who knew lol."
5,Antonio Mateo Garcia,"‚Ä¶ I just wish the premium subscription was a bit more affordable but compared to other similar apps, this has been my fav and I‚Äôve only had it for less than a month."
5,DoxiemomTX,I got this app a few weeks ago and love playing. I believe this app with its customized targeted games has helped improve my quick thinking and memory skills. I get better and betterüòÅ. You have to try it!
5,H!gh$cor3,"I am not a fan of the next new app, or games. At all! I decided to try this one out and I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs so much better than I thought it would be to begin with. Let‚Äôs continue brain building Impulse. I will definitely suggest to my friends!"
5,Thoku2000,I have been using this app for just about 2 weeks and It‚Äôs awesome! I actually feel different parts of my brain working as I complete the tasks! Excited to see what I can accomplish after a whole year!
2,knumbskull721,"It‚Äôs a fun app and the ads don‚Äôt bother me much. The ads can get annoying on occasion, but what‚Äôs worse is the fact that you can‚Äôt get your results to the tests unless you pay. The tests is why I initially downloaded this app, but I can‚Äôt even see my results without paying, which I‚Äôm not. The games are fun and I enjoy the tracking, but this is unnecessary and annoying."
5,Ryan Tamula,Impulse is a great app for anyone that‚Äôs on the girl. I have a busy schedule and spend a lot of screen time. This app allows me to do quick brain exercises to keep me sharp and continue to elevate my game. Strong mind. Strong Mind. Strong Spirit.
5,PageMason,"I‚Äôm new to this app, but so far I love it! The different games each day seem to already have had an impact on my memory and mental sharpness. The quiz and test options are impressive. I look forward to continuing on! Definitely recommend!"
5,Shellymbest,I have always been into finding out more and challenging myself to stimulate my brain. I love learning new things. But sometime I just like to do things that help me to think without having to have emotion tied to it. This app is great!! You‚Äôll enjoy it too!!
1,OhItsMissa,"Got recommended by a Instagram. Didn‚Äôt want to fully commit without trying the app first. Signed up for the free trial, if I liked it would have bought it for the year. Tried one personality quiz, not able see results without paying the yearly rate, declined then offered to get report for $4.99. What‚Äôs the point of the feee trial if you can‚Äôt access the results. Save your money! Bait and switch tactics are off putting."
5,SnowflakeVT,"Find that these games, exercise different parts of my brain than the typical games that I have downloaded. So far these are short games easy to understand and I get quick feedback."
5,ninesacrifices,I started using impulse and absolutely love the challenging games I play. I have even allowed my son to try and he does extremely well and it keeps him focused in a good way. We do this together and it‚Äôs a fun part of our day to look forward to!!
5,RandisDandi,I‚Äôve only been playing for a couple days so from what I‚Äôve played today it‚Äôs been all right. I think I‚Äôm going to like it so I can‚Äôt really give you a true review because I haven‚Äôt played it that long but so far so good I like.
5,Laiken#The1&Only,It really makes you pay attention and be aware of your surroundings and aware of other senses that could be and are helping you at the time but you never stop & realize it.  This game helps you recognize plus strengthen it.
5,Jojo2012321,"I got this game yesterday and I‚Äôm already in love!!! It is a really fun brain training game, and it‚Äôs not like those other games that your parents would complain about you playing! Because you‚Äôre using your mind to play these games!"
4,danebodmer,It‚Äôs awesome to be able to just hop on and keep my mind sharp. The games are interesting and at such a high variety. There is many different options depending on which brain function you need most. How interactive this app truly is puts it so much higher than many in my mind!
5,wheres my timex,I like the challenge of making my brain work instead of sitting watching the tv. I‚Äôm glad my daughter told me about it. I‚Äôve been depressed over some medical issues and this is somewhere positive to put my energy.
5,CraftyBee2020,Feel like I‚Äôm doing something more useful than scrolling media. I love the puzzles and I‚Äôm learning my memory is better than I thought. No complaints about this app at all! Was only going to do the free trial but definitely decided to keep it.
4,Saavy Chica!,"Great game, I noticed the more than I played it the faster I became. I can definitely see how it would be beneficial in helping to recognize patterns faster and with more accuracy which is critical throughout the business day for any professional. Speed and accuracy is the name of the game!"
5,Dominic080806,It is a neat app to keep your Bain working through the day. Also It offers many ways to do. I would recommend trying it just to see if it can help you focus or whatever your trying to improve
5,new2LetGo,This app has definitely given me a way exercise my Brain on a daily basis!!! I love seeing myself improve and challenge myself!! It definitely makes me feel accomplished and is much better than watching hours of television !!!!!
5,Camille_teofila,Definitely helps with the recent memory loss I‚Äôve started having. the Dr suggested it to exercise the brain muscles and I‚Äôve had fewer moments of memory loss. I will say I get a headache after playing certain skills but I think that‚Äôs a good thing lol.
5,Alwan777,"I like this app because it makes me sharp by showing me my weak points and allowing me to work on skills to enhance them. There are different tests that can reveal your strengths and traits and many different exercises to enhance your brain mathematically, logically, and linguistically. Thank you."
5,Scottish Julie,I am recovering from encephalitis of the brain and have lots of therapists and appointments. I have been encouraged to play games do puzzles to exercise my brain. I have shown this application to my cognitive therapist and she gives it five stars. I‚Äôll give it five stars because I enjoy it.
5,ItsPJCdude,"I never leave these, but I feel compelled to by this awesome app. It‚Äôs paced perfectly to train the mind from fun & simple to difficult & challenging. The great thing about Impulse is that by the time you get to the super challenging parts, you‚Äôre well prepared. I love this app!"
5,sarabeeee77,"I am always busy, but it‚Äôs super easy to use this app to taken even just 10 minutes out of my day to sharpen my brain. I‚Äôve been struggling with brain fog and memory, so I‚Äôm very excited to see my improvement over time."
5,Macfavor,I definitely am getting into the games. They are fun and I can see how they help with my focus my concentration in my memory. I‚Äôve only use this for a couple of days I look forward to doing another review sometime down the road.
4,SOFIAAAAüòÇ,This game is really good for when bored I give it 4 starts Bc u can‚Äôt unlock anything so far I played for a long time now and I haven‚Äôt u locked anything I love the way it doesn‚Äôt give u all lot of adds but the game are pretty challenging I would recommend if u don‚Äôt have a game that entertains ur brain the game keeps u r brain active ‚Ä¶ok bye
5,Ju¬ßt‚âàƒØ√ßƒô,"I‚Äôm not really into games, but I loooove all the progresses my brain. My enjoyment probably comes from my loves for brain expansion and progression, but over time this could really help you out mentally. I didn‚Äôt realize they made games for that type of thing, but I‚Äôm sooo happy I do now!"
5,Kaidence B.,"This app is a very good brain-sharpening game!! Over time, I have noticed my skills sharpen. I know it sounds like that you won‚Äôt see your skills sharpen, but you‚Äôll see. I though that my skills wouldn‚Äôt sharpen either but I was proved wrong! Please get this game!"
4,ShaNiya is the star,I love this game but there is one problem there are so many ads. I also think they should make the question go to 10 instead of 5 or 7 or whatever. I absolutely love this it‚Äôs so fun to play I would like them to add something where you could compete against someone but the game is very cool!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è
2,Lucasm123,"I had understood the subscription was $9.99/month; it is in fact $9.99 per WEEK. Which is ridiculous! This is a quality and fun way to spend your free time playing useful brain games to train your mind, but there are significantly cheaper alternatives than essentially $40 a month, If you‚Äôre paying weekly. Again, it‚Äôs a good app, but way too costly and I had thought I was paying for a monthly subscription of $9.99, not a weekly one. Ouch."
5,I hate nicknames!!,"Each test really shows your strengths and weaknesses, and then gives you the opportunity to work on your weakest skills and still improve on your best skills. If you like challenges, then give this a try!"
5,Dream with C,"Hahahah‚Ä¶.Actually it‚Äôs all brain and tons of play. The brain is like muscles, if you don‚Äôt train it then you‚Äôll lose function and memory loss. This is a terrific way to keep your skills fresh and your mind moving and grooving."
5,JJ_J2J,The reason impulse is so good is apps don‚Äôt pop up every 5 seconds to they let you focus on getting smarter for every couple lessons. It‚Äôs also really good for memory loss. Overall that is why i think impulse deserves 5 stars.
5,CowboyBacon,"Great variety. I enjoy it until I get to the questions. There are way too many questions. Also, sorting the water or balls goes on way too long. I have never had it tell me I completed that section."
5,Epic Everything,"I used to think I was an idiot. Until I played this game. I‚Äôm 9 years old, and the lowest age group was 13-17. I outplayed most of my peers while playing. Also, I took an IQ test before and after playing. My IQ changed DRASTICALLY after playing this."
5,Baby doll 915,I love a challenge and this game has it. It also has test all you have to do is answer questions and then it will show you what the results are
4,Ramation,"I‚Äôm tired of games that drag on too long, & seem to have only two primary objectives; Impress you with graphics& complexities just long enough to brain wash you into spending real world money to achieve a sense of success or fulfillment over other ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, If their even Real."
5,coolmorningz,At first I didn‚Äôt want to pay for any app. However this app keeps me motivated and challenged. I am on day 87 and look forward to my daily exercises for my brain. Keep up the good work. My fav are the word games. Hope you add more soon !!!
5,Nellie1269,"Absolutely love this app. Been using it for about a year now. I love the tests, the games and the puzzles. I find it challenging, but not so difficult that I get frustrated often. Only once in a while, haha. Great way to wind down at the end of the day."
5,roblox man faceüî•,this game is very helpful. It helps me memorize stuff and do a lot more things that I couldn‚Äôt do it gives you a lot of things like your IQ your personality type what type of ADHD you have and that‚Äôs just to start. This app is very amazing and I love it.
5,5harkB821!,I‚Äôve only been using this app for a day but already feel better. The games are fun and the ‚Äútests‚Äù have useful information about how my brain works which helps me better understand myself!
1,DSSABI,"I bought a lifetime subscription, and for many months I could use it undisturbed by ads.  Just recently, I‚Äôve been getting ads for other game apps; I try to close it, but it won‚Äôt close!     Also, one of the word games won‚Äôt fill in the some of the words I enter.  Frustrating!  Not what I signed up for!  I‚Äôd like my lifetime subscription refunded, but don‚Äôt know how to reach the appropriate party to complain."
5,Azal√Øa,"At first I was very skeptical but once I got to try out most of the ‚Äúgames‚Äù it offers I can definitely see the progression you can make jf you dedicated 5min of your time daily, instead of being on social media."
4,TamiFi,"I really like impulse. I love the games aren‚Äôt as challenging, but they still work your mind to its limits, putting it out of its comfort zone. Although I really do hate that you have to pay. It would be great help for lots of people wanting to expand their ranges of thinking, as well as their overall mindset."
4,alexallday,"I love this game so much, some people who have never played this game and might think it‚Äôs boring, but it‚Äôs actually an amazing and fun game, I have showed this game to some friends and family and they also love it. I do wish that they would TAKE OFF THE ADDS FOR FREE because they are just so annoying and I can ever hardly focus"
5,marleyhoo,These games are a fun way to give your brain a little exercise. I like the way they increase in challenge as you go. They only downside is the advertisements that slow down the game. I do recommend this to anyone!
2,TransAmMaMa,"The free trial says you have access to everything for the first three days, which you can take the tests but when you‚Äôre done and you get to the point it gives you the results, it doesn‚Äôt let you see them unless you pay for a subscription. Such a waste of time on the test and not be able to read the results unless I pay. So dumb"
1,Darjae the Don,"Wanted to do a free trial to see if it would help me learn about myself and help me improve a little.. mental health is the reason I‚Äôm personally downloading this , to seek interludes of help between therapy ; it seemed interesting. With the games a bit. But then I took an almos t 100 question quiz and in the end instead of getting the results , it got an add saying to unlock my results I needed to pay for the full app before cthey gave me the results. Quite disappointing and frustrating."
5,Tori_mcshorty98,I‚Äôve always wanted to improve my memory and other skills. I used to be an alcoholic. I‚Äôve only tried this for a couple days and already feel like I‚Äôm doing better. Simple to use.
1,TimofeyKl,"The number of shady and manipulative techniques this uses to have you spend money is unbelievable. It gathers all of the information, makes you complete the test only to tell you that unless you buy it, we won't show you the results. This is frustrating, and I feel like you're just robbing me.  At least be upfront about the fact that you can only access the results when you pay."
5,Anagramita,"I enjoy the variety of activities and believe they are keeping my intellect sharp.  I‚Äôm 65 and I think it is beneficial to do these activities every day.  I chose the one-and-done fee, rather than monthly or yearly billing, and I think that was a good decision."
5,Rpr6-2-3,Your brain needs exercise just like the rest of your body but it improves faster with small & varied sessions instead of massive powerlifting type. This app makes it easy to help keep those cognitive functions on point.
3,J.R. 102216,"Impulse isn‚Äôt my favorite brain training app, but it‚Äôs still good. I believe it focuses more on memory and response, but it‚Äôs a simple practice to insert into your daily routine. And I received a great lifetime deal as well. The only real issue I‚Äôve had is the app ‚Äúrestoring my progress‚Äù and deleting my daily streak. I‚Äôve attempted to contact customer service, but have received no reply."
5,Zombie otis,What would you doing on your phone otherwise? I love this app. I use it a few times a day when I have a moment. It feel better than doomscrolling social media.
5,CNEECE,This app is by far the most well out together Brain app out there. I have been struggling to not only find a great app but one that will challenge me every step of the way! Thank you for the details put into this!
5,Crystal & Jordan üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®,"I love the games in this app because they are well rounded and intriguing. Math, reading, patterns, memory, and articulation done in a fun and engaging way. My absolute favorite is the color sort tube game. I definitely recommend to have a fun challenge and revisit forgotten knowledge."
5,Aloe and Mena,Best brain game due to the fact there is a variety of different skill sets involved. If you are weak in one area you can keep going back to that area and build your skills up. Great all around family game
5,Ms Michael‚Äôs Progress,"Interesting,not boring . How to play is well demonstrated and you can rewatch it. The games give me hope of bettering my mind. I have had fear of mind games (not smart enough to do well) these games did not intimidate me at all. It is not about being highly educated."
4,BookNookMomma,"Some brain building apps are expensive and honestly loose interest for me to want to keep going and end up deleting it  This one is fun, interesting, and keeps me wanting to play more and cNt wait to see how much of a difference it will help me with the longer I play over time!"
5,This Nana Rocks,At 62 you do notice that you‚Äôre starting to not remember as quick as you used to and games like this by playing them. I‚Äôve noticed that my memory is coming back and I am getting faster at responding.
1,Grenouille192,"Locking someone‚Äôs IQ test report and trauma test report behind a paywall is so screwed up. And yes, I know it shows the basic results without payment. But if this app were really trying to help people work towards self improvement it wouldn‚Äôt keep most of the info you needed to help yourself from you. Also, for anyone looking for fun brain games, there are hundreds of other apps with the same games for free. Seriously, don‚Äôt get roped into paying for this app."
2,DistantCry_,"If you‚Äôve used duolingo, imagine that system of ad placements but worse. Closing ads is awkward and once you think you‚Äôve closed it, its serves you an interactive ad of the same game, and now you have to close that one. The memory games are fun, but the devs are crazy if they think this amount of ads is acceptable. I would rather them paywall most of the content. Instant uninstall."
5,Emi-rella,"Been looking for something to distress from work, but also keep my mind sharp. Also have been looking for something to help my dad‚Äôs memory and think this one is worthwhile for anyone with onset memory struggles."
5,fullname here,"So Wifey was struttin‚Äô around the house one day and changin clothes quicker than a chameleon changes color. So I asked her, ‚Äúbabe, where I buyin‚Äô all these clothes from?‚Äù  She was like, ‚ÄúI just buy them on impulse, okay!‚Äù  So I downloaded this app and I still don‚Äôt where the Add To Cart button is."
5,ruchellib,"I am loving Impulse as I feel a lot smarter using my time training my brain vs on instagram üôÉ. I feel that sometimes we open instagram just to spend time, as we‚Äôre used to it, and now I do Impulse instead!"
5,nay-nay2010,I‚Äôve enjoyed the fun and challenging brain games. This app has each game can be so different or require a different skill set. It does cost money but could be handy. If it‚Äôs some thing you‚Äôre looking for to challenge yourself.
5,cknngt__MaStEr,I love this game so much!!! I first was upset at the amount of money you have to pay but I got the 92% off discount!!! I only have to pay 26 dollars a year. This game is so fun and you should download it too. It has so many fun games and I feel as if it‚Äôs sharpened my mind already.
5,Adam TX Boater,I like this app because it offers quick improvements to mental intelligence. I‚Äôve been looking for an app to help train my memory and become quicker to thought - I think I found it!
5,Jazbdkskdksj,Great app you can still play games on it without buying and it fun while still training your brain I do recommend buying because you get a lot more access and you can see your details.
5,Sol_amaro,"I‚Äôm not fully confident in the math sections, so this will definitely help me improve and refresh any basic math I‚Äôve forgotten. If you are worried about the math section don‚Äôt worry they have other games and puzzles to choose from."
5,meoooooowz,I really like having this app on my phone. the games are fun and every time I reach for my phone out of habit I just open this app instead of spending more time on social media.  I think the cost was worth it.
5,emmbum,"I love the way they help to exercise the brain in cute little fun ways. They do so well with categorizing. Highly recommend the daily exercises. You may not do fantastic but at least you participated. Anyone can do it and they help explain the math puzzles, too."
5,Fallen Dawn Swan,I think this is the best game in the world. I think that troubled teens that are depressed and play violent video games that simulate violent acts should play these games instead. Then they can become really smart or intelligent. Then they would be less likely to have school shootings.
5,Ridiculous57,"I‚Äôm on Day 2 of training.  I like the variety of the games so far.  The app also includes games you can play on your own in addition to the ones selected for you in the training session.  So far, so good!"
5,cbsitruc,"Being consistent and doing a few games a day helps me stay sharp and is improving quick recall, in head math and my memory, which has really need a pick me up. This game is fun and very helpful. I enjoy it but most importantly it helps!"
5,Jayboogie2k23,It does increase your anxiety levels because very thing is timed to complete certain task. If it wasn‚Äôt timed in the beginning from the onset then it would be something to get use to. But overall I do recommend it!
5,Faster cars = more fun,"I had COVID last November, and since, I just felt lke my brain wouldn‚Äôt compute like it did before. After a few days of this game, I can actually feel my brain coming back online. I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù, but this one is by far the best!"
5,Leadfist72,"Definitely helps me sharpen my mind instead of watching some kind of ‚Äúporn‚Äù be it pornography (ü§Æ), car-porn, food-porn, then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúclips‚Äù & shorts that waste so much time with no added benefit!!! If your gonna ‚Äúwaste time‚Äù, ‚Äúwaste it on something worthwhile‚Äù!!‚Ä¶"
5,55Lizzie55,This app is amazing because it allows you to learn while having fun doing it. I also like the fact that it gives you free games to play in the meantime while waiting for the daily lesson. Thank you for making this app!!
5,CutthroatEtta,"Impulse is fun because the games take you through levels that increase in difficulty, which also makes it challenging. There are sooo many different types of games as well."
4,bjffxx,"If you want to test your capabilities it‚Äôs a fun app to try. It‚Äôs only annoying at times when you have to pay to unlock all the good features. Although, it‚Äôs pretty good compared to other apps I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs my third day of playing and I enjoy the time I spend."
1,Minicoop-33,This app allows you to get a 3 day free trial and then you will be charged $7 per week after that. $7 per week is insanely overpriced for what this app is and likely makes loads of money from people who either forget to cancel after the trial or from kids that accept the subscription and then the parents are charged until they notice the charge. Quit being a shady company and charging hundreds of dollars per year for a weekly subscription.
5,rpt 361,I love this game it keeps my brain going and I love that it shows you how to play at the same time I wish h in could afford this game to play more often thanks guys for letting me play for free while it lasted I would definitely encourage more players to come and play
4,O-Sandoval,The game is fun to play just hate having to deal with ads every two rounds I‚Äôm not the type of person to pay for no ads but if they could have a function where you watch a video to get rid of ads for ten minutes that would be amazingüëç
3,‚òÅÔ∏èEmmaphant‚òÅÔ∏è,"Great application for brain training, but I downloaded the app based on an advertisement about learning your trauma response. I wanted to learn more about flight, fight, freeze and fawn and which response I use personally. There are no tests regarding this or further information, disappointing.  When I tried to research how to access this in the app, I find no help."
5,annsamuel,This app is really giving my brain the exercise it needs. I enjoy the variety and the ability to take surveys and have the content catered to the results focusing on certain areas
4,Andy Kotz/ AKMusic Productions,"I‚Äôm having fun with this. Came in handy since lately (I‚Äôm 61), I‚Äôve been forgetting simple things. Not sure if it‚Äôs the meds I‚Äôm on or if it‚Äôs something worse. So I started to seek out challenges for my brain to keep my focus sharp. Too soon to tell if it‚Äôs working yet but this is a fun little app!"
1,Ang_Vinces,Well yeah... highly disappointed at the mischievous way they have of getting you tricked into BUYING this app. I can agree that it will trick your brain before it starts training it. The fact of being so used to ‚Äútapping for Apple ID‚Äù I tapped before I was even able to say no; I was able to read it was $4.99 weekly after the 3 day trial. Like no! I‚Äôm not paying $20 a month for a game. Then I looked everywhere on the settings and policies and you can‚Äôt even cancel it with one click... this is really upsetting.
1,Villafuerte4028,"Hi, I deleted this app because I had not been using it but I keep getting charged every week. I‚Äôve been charged twice now even after I deleted the app. Please refund me my money, I have tried to opt out of this subscription by going into the app settings but I have no option to opt out of paying for this app. Am I going to keep getting charged even after deleting this app? Please resolve this issue and process my refund. This app producer has been ignoring my emails. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!"
2,ahfeehan,"I bought this because of a test that is still being advertised on Instagram, about childhood trauma. I did use this app for a while, but that test never showed up. I tried asking about it through their Help via text and email. I got no response. I did do the ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù for awhile, and took some tests, but I‚Äôm not happy about the missing test.  False advertising!"
5,TrumpTrainCrash2020,I am really enjoying this brain training app. Keeps me sharp and gives me ideas to use with my patients who have had a traumatic brain injury or other cognitive decline to help with their brain function! Wonderful app!
4,Alice. w. Lyons,I have had this for a few days now and I think it‚Äôs a great app!! The only thing that is a little annoying is that it prompts you to join a membership and there are a few adds but otherwise I think it‚Äôs a cool app that has some fun little brain exercises.
5,Lizziegamer9,Not only does this game test your mind and build your abilities but it can also teach you about yourself and helps you relax all in one! No game I‚Äôve played has mastered this until I found Impulse. I highly suggest this game to everyone.
5,Queen of the Best,I‚Äôve been trying to find a app that works for helping people stimulate the brain function. This app is my favorite app. I love it so much I  play it everyday twice a day at least. Worth the money I spent on it.
5,Mwihaki,"I recently started doing this at the end of the day and I absolutely love the mental challenge! I def do better at some that others; being super competitive, it makes me want to score above 95th percentile! I‚Äôll certainly keep playing!"
5,Amy Lynette,I look forward to my daily challenges on the Impulse app. I love that I get challenged in different topics and there are so many more topics that i can challenge myself with! I definitely recommend this app to everyone that wants brain twisters!
2,Mayor Toons,"I have asked many times where the advertised test is that shows pics and depending on what you see first determines if there is trauma etc. and no one has responded so I am assuming it was bait to download the games. The games are fun for a few weeks but become boring rather quickly. Also, the statistics on how you perform compared to others on the games seem fake."
5,Super chick 180,"I use it to take a break and I felt like I was using my brain, instead of doom scrolling. I eventually bought it because I hate advertising always happening between games. But I use it once I day so to me it was worth it."
5,bsasam.echo,Would have to say it is definitely something I would say is children safe so far and is quite entertaining rather than watching tiktok keeps my brain from feeling like I‚Äôm suffocating from boredom.
5,nyabugg,It‚Äôs a cute little app and i like that they let me play some games even when im not a paying customer. I‚Äôm really broke but I wanted my studies to go better than they are now and I just started this so I really hope it helps üò≠
5,HopeLyon77,I really like this app. The challenges are short enough you can do them in a few minutes whenever you have a spare minute of boredom. I also like the longer ones like the personality test.
5,dlaray,"This app is truly helping me come out of a state of confusion, bringing back to the light ( being in the know ) with information that makes things so clear. I love this app. You should definitely download it. You will not regret it."
5,Cj Oneally,This has been a great app so far. I feel like it‚Äôs enabled me to tap into a whole Nother level of my cognitive skills my senses seem sharper my thoughts quicker. Now if I can just get my vocabulary and reading up to speed.üòÅ
5,Anna_Wake,I like being on my phone but scrolling on social medias isn‚Äôt always entertaining. These games are fun and entertaining. I‚Äôm not a big phone game fan but I spend a good bit of time playing these
5,Petiedro,This is actually an amazing app. Love learning and learning more about myself. Then to do daily quizzes to improve my brain. Absolutely enjoying this app and cannot wait to see my hard change me from the inside out.
5,WarStorm-Sterben,"It cost money, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it. Its definitely good for keeping the brain sharp, and it‚Äôs a healthy way to pass time when you‚Äôre bored or just before you get ready for bed."
5,Jbar9203,I have had so much chemo my brain just doesn't function as clearly as I want it to. These brain games are not only fun I feel they are what I need to sharpen my memory and help me regain confidence to feel like me again!!! I highly Recommend!!!
5,goernerv,I‚Äôve been using Impulse for about a year. It is quick and easy to fit into my day. I will definitely continue to use the app and tell my  friends and family!
5,Annoyed2011,So I‚Äôm a school girl and I love challenging my brain to higher standards. impulse helps me with that there are three puzzle/games that it recommends for you a day they are fun and challenging. And you can do tests games and so much more to make your brain think better and faster.
5,Nanof9üíó,"It‚Äôs good to train your brain to different stimuli. The games seem easy ,but using skills you don‚Äôt typically use everyday is fun to see how fast you can react . Test your brain ,challenge your accuracy and speed. And have fun ."
5,JQMort1,"Playing games, whoever thought this simple thing could improve your mental health. I‚Äôm addicted!! So much I don‚Äôt even think about training my brain. So many different activities that you never get bored. 5 stars is not enough!!"
5,NateJain,"I‚Äôm constantly looking for good ways to relax and give my head a break. This app really does let me take a break from life, while also giving me something fun to put some effort into."
5,fergiegirl13,"These games are perfect for enhancing my focus which is why I chose it. I can tell depending on the time of day, my mood, and even whether on an empty stomach or not how well I score or how bad I score. I will definitely continue to play with focus! Love the games‚Ä¶"
2,MaddenIsRllyBadd,I am truly upset. I just took a 60 question in test which I thought was fee but nope! At the end of the test it made me have to pick a payment option just to see my score Like at least instead of making people waste their time for something they have to pay for at the end at least let them know they have to pay for it before hand.
5,Jennf1,"After a concussion and TBI, this game has helped me tremendously! I had to start out very simple and work my way up. After reviewing it with my concussion therapist, she actually recommended continuing daily within my screen time limitations."
5,1JPWise$,Impulse is an excellent way to keep you mind eyes and focus sharp. Just a few minutes everyday can enhance one‚Äôs ability to process information and respond much quicker than your average person
5,Gud41mo,This is the very first game I‚Äôve played that I can actually feel my brain working. I also like that it tells you the percentage of people you beat and the intensity of each level you gain. Great Game!
5,popstarbunny,I used the free trial of this app and instantly fell in love with the variety of options and genuinely fun brain-engaging games. The personality test was spot-on and my roommates even thought it was extremely accurate. They do offer discount awards if you try it by just using the app!
5,mjsmh,Everyone says just start by starting with a task or journey that seems full of mountains - I‚Äôm grateful to have found something that‚Äôs quick and helpful while also EXTREMELY informative .. thank you impulse app!
5,Hair2DayGone2Morrow,I‚Äôm 51 usually pretty sharp but since Covid my processing has gotten foggy. Originally thought this app was childish until I realized it actually makes you obviously think  and process unlike other video games.
2,BookishBeauty,"Far too many ads on the free version. At the start of the game, at the end, in between levels. It‚Äôs constant. And premium is so pricey. $6.99/week?? That‚Äôs $28/month. We‚Äôre not the 1%. We don‚Äôt have $28/month to spend on a phone app üôÑ The lifetime price isn‚Äôt so bad but it doesn‚Äôt look like the app is updated with new games/levels often so I‚Äôm still not convinced it‚Äôs worth it."
4,jajajajjajajajajajajja,There tests say there gonna tell you all this information about you had my answer 40 questions then just told me one of the things and said I had to pay for the rest of the report very disappointing
5,xxkebexx,I like being able to strengthen my brain even when I‚Äôm busy working and doing school work. It‚Äôs fast and not very time consuming. My family has a history of dementia so I‚Äôm hoping this will help prevent me from developing it.
5,deepseaxXiren,Really great way to spend down time instead of scrolling through social apps for hours! I can really feel my brain getting sharper after each exercise.
4,Nikula0567,They actually include an IQ test which I don‚Äôt think should be a sales gimmick. I think there should be a placement evaluation or analysis of some sort because I‚Äôm not compete if with everyone else. My current cognitive status is weaker than it used to be. Idk that the app understands that. Otherwise I luv it!!!!
5,Keasha001,Why I say this is that I actually enjoy this because they have multiple games to help your brain kind regenerate and you play 3 games for your daily play it‚Äôs really fun good games so definitely recommend to buy this!ü§≠
5,Sundayracer,Please update with new (different) games. Love the games and variety. I paid for the yearly fee. Though once getting passed the 80 plus levels they are getting boring.  Please develop different games.  Thanks.
5,Anonymous xxoox,This game is awesome!!Its so fun and that you have the option of several different types of games it‚Äôs so cool! I love this game so much especially because I travel a lot and this is an offline game so I use it all the time! It‚Äôs also a really good stress/anxiety reliever app!!
5,Mi amor‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö,Impulse is a really amazing app with wonderful game that are fun but still stimulates my brain and with the daily reminders I can not worry about forgetting about it and instead just see the reminder and play wonderful games that give me a fun break but still keep me focused
5,Dc4misty,I‚Äôm almost 50. My brain has been feeling like mush a lot these days. I teach 5 year olds all day. It‚Äôs challenging work don‚Äôt get me wrong but not intellectually if that makes sense. This app is helping me to unwind and my brain feels like it‚Äôs getting a massage! Honestly!
1,807777753541,Stupid garbage app that steals money 7$ a week doesn‚Äôt say anything so pointless if you feel the need to throw your money away then power to you. this app gives you a ‚Äúbetter brain‚Äù and yet purchasing it for 7 dollars a week 28 dollars a month is possibly the stupidest decision you could make. Maybe Read a book instead of doing stupid mini games to ‚Äúbetter your brain‚Äù. This app has been bankrupting me secretly and draining my card EVERY WEEK.
4,only1me,"When you take a moment for yourself to keep growing with Impulse, you‚Äôll find yourself on a mission to overcome the little challenges in a fun way! Quick lil games & quest for mastery keeps your brain sharp; you don‚Äôt become mush, complacent, or overindulged with endless entrapments of video games.  4 stars is for cost $$$"
5,Teacher Del,"This app is easy to use, doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time and you can feel the brain stimulation at the couple of each training exercise. Highly recommend it to help keep your brain sharp."
5,lauren endall,"Definitely keeps the brain working and helps your memory, along with even having the ability to make you smarter in ALL aspects. I got lucky and won a 92% off for a yearly plan so I‚Äôm only paying around $2.3 per month. Amazing"
1,Pgroot,I ended up with this app after seeing an ad that showed some interesting charts/metrics. Have yet to see the charts shown in the advertisement and accidentally purchased a year subscription when i accepted a chance discount because the wording didnt specify accepting the discount would confirm purchase. The rest of the app is okay but really just a collection of simple games- way lower effort than some other brain training apps ive seen or tried previously.
5,CJM077007,"Love this app. It really helps when I‚Äôm relaxing. Fun, helpful, educational, and cool. Highly recommend this app for children-adults. Thank me later. Not many ads if any at all. If you older you just want play a game and not feel childish or judged for it this is the app."
5,xolinamusicox,I enjoy using impulse because the games are fun while also giving me a chance to test my knowledge and keep my brain engaged. It‚Äôs a better way for me to start my phone use for the day then scrolling on social media
5,dividt,"Highly recommended! It highly increased my focus and memory. I used to get distracted so easily during class and never retain information, but after using the app memory had drastically change along with focus too."
1,GS-home,"I had to type this on the note app then paste the text because it will not allow me to type properly since I‚Äôm giving it only 1 star.   This is aggressive in making sure they receive 5 stars, as I was playing the game it asked me to review the app and would not allow me to close the popup review button, I literally had to close the app. A complete cheap scam! Would not recommend!! Honestly doesn‚Äôt even deserve 1 star for the crappy games!"
5,mmdrys,I really like the games they challenge me and works my memory as well because I am getting older and I want to do these games before I learn my new language on Babbel. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to keep my brain active at my age.
5,R00$TER,"Very exciting, challenging but still possible to accomplish. Helping me as I find myself out of reach of my studies with applying myself to achieve an eligible score to be accepted into the AirForce. Thank you! to the creators and investors who made this App possible for everyday Humans such as myself :)  Mahalo Nui from Maui!"
5,plnmnm1,By far the best spring training app that I‚Äôve tried. I especially like the example so there‚Äôs no confusion about what you need to do for each game. Highly recommend. Could improve the pricing however.
5,Kahdajah,I wanted something that‚Äôll keep me interested and help me improve my overall brain machine lol. It‚Äôs definitely helps me figure out the things I‚Äôm good at and the things I need to work on. And the ads aren‚Äôt annoying.
5,GinaQ789,I absolutely love this game. The levels of intensity are incredible. It‚Äôs like warm ups for your brain as each level gets more intense. I am amazed at what I thought I couldn‚Äôt remember. Definitely a keeper and definitely will continue playing.
3,Amy J. MacBook Pro,"Before I start : Dunninger-Kruger Effect. Okay, I‚Äôm 48. I know how to use a phone. Seriously, do you (developers) think I‚Äôll actually pay to use an app with a free trial? By the by‚Ä¶ if there wasn‚Äôt a free trial (just a paid app), I totally wouldn‚Äôt download it. Also - as I‚Äôm 48 and have known my IQ since I was roughly 10, it was (186). We do lose IQ points as we age. Based on recent tests, I stand at 164. So‚Ä¶ yeah."
5,Afizzzzlesizkh,"App is very visually appealing and engaging. I love the games and the opportunities to give feedback, it makes me feel like they take the feedback seriously and want to make continuous improvements. I was offered at 92% discount on a year subscription - would recommend!!"
5,TNicolette,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews. Ever. However!! This app is literally the best mind pleasing app lol. I find myself laughing in the middle of the games or I‚Äôll consider them different task‚Ä¶they become challenging but it‚Äôs a very pleasing challenging. Words can‚Äôt describe enough, try it out."
5,sherry5614,I am surprised at what activity I am quick at and which I am not.  Surprised at math operations ‚Ä¶.. actually thinking of doing some practice exercises.  Love doing this.  Have the app on 2 different devices.  Each Impulse is at a different level. Very fun
1,Shpage,"I downloaded Impulse last night and finally sat down to work on the games this morning. I chose to go the free route. Upon choosing the game you want to play, you‚Äôre required to watch an ad. That‚Äôs fine with me, seeing as it‚Äôs free, but I was never able to get past the ad. It would freeze every time. I tried closing the app and opening again several times, and even tried opening a different game. Same results. I‚Äôll stick with the other apps that work better."
5,HeavenlySunsetSkies,"I love this app it‚Äôs really fun, I highly recommend it to people who struggle with memory, identifying trauma, math, or finding out whether or not you could possibly have ADHD, however it‚Äôs best to talk to a professional when trying to get a diagnoses üòä"
5,rhythm of mankind,I am enjoying this game for the speed you are required to think and react with accuracy. Recommend this especially for seniors who like to enjoy the activity as well measure their skills and performance.
5,Banananaanananana,"I just started using it but so far so good, I can play without paying you just watch adds, which is pretty neat. I honestly can‚Äôt pay, so I‚Äôm glad it has that option. As for the app itself it is pretty fun and hopefully I get smarter xD"
5,Teezy_DiVinci,"This game is pretty cool. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs working because I‚Äôve only had it for a day and I smoke a lot of marijuana but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs legal here. Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna give it five stars because someone worked hard on this app and I can tell üëçüèæ"
1,Ashleyerae,I downloaded the app after reading all the great reviews and was promptly offered a 7 day free trial to premium access. I accepted and tried the app for several days but ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt for me. I proactively cancelled the upcoming subscription 48 hours before it was set to begin yet I was still charged and now Apple is refusing to refund. Unbelievable that the app can offer a fake trial and get away with charging for it. Stay away.
5,brad21212121,This app helps work your mind in multiple ways and allows you get baseline results to train your mind. Also provides insight on how your mind works. Would recommend for anyone to try
5,deonBH,"Brain training app so far! This app has IQ test, along with many other test. It has many kinds of training techniques as well and updates you along the way. Best part is you have fun while you‚Äôre doing it!"
5,A Whitedawn,A lot of other games out there don‚Äôt have half the fun and feature as this app. If you purchase the premium you won‚Äôt be sorry. There are endless amounts of games that are challenging yet relaxing. Try it!
2,MelanieBalls,"There‚Äôs absolutely no way to cancel once you sign up. No link to cancel within the app, the email address apparently doesn‚Äôt have anyone checking it (or it doesn‚Äôt work), and you may have to resort to getting your bank to reverse the charges. This is a poor way to do business. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the games are pretty fun."
2,SunflowerzNsunshine,"I use this app to manage my anxiety and a lot of the games help me to do so. However, over the last month, the app has become SO SLOW! I have to restart it after finishing just one round of a game. I‚Äôve tried other games in the app and they are all lagging. I‚Äôve given it time to fix the bugs ‚Ä¶ but I wish I had not spend money on this app. It‚Äôs unusable in its current state."
2,Fred5231,"Games are pretty good, but there is a ridiculous number of ads. Sometimes up to 4 for a single mini game, even skipping they usually take longer than the games themselves. With the premise of the app being what it is, this level of interruption destroys the experience for me. How can you train focus or memory when most of your time is spent navigating ads?"
1,Angelgirl2469,They try to get you by asking you a few times to try their service for a few days then $7/thereafter. I signed up to try it and they charged my bank account and now I can‚Äôt a refund. I‚Äôm on disability and that‚Äôs a lot to me. I just wanted to try it but they charged me anyway. I can‚Äôt get ahold of anyone to ask for a refund so that‚Äôs why I am posting this here. I‚Äôve deleted the app and I‚Äôm not using it because of how they did me!
1,Mace272727272727,"literally 30 second ads CONSTANTLY. when u enter the app, there‚Äôs an ad. when u click the game u wanna play, there‚Äôs an ad. inbetween each level, there‚Äôs an ad. then when u exit the game there‚Äôs also an ad. i spend more time watching ads than actually doing the games on there. after having 2 concussions i was hoping for a fun stimulating app, and this has the potential to be but the ads are far too many."
5,amielee_14,I‚Äôm a current undergrad student majoring in psychology. I love the information this game is able to grasp about me as well as the tips for improvement. It‚Äôs also great to keep your mind sharp playing games that tug at your mind in a positive way.
5,SusPup72,"I certainly have my favorites within the app, but I enjoy almost all of them sometimes.   Just wondering when the ‚Äúnew levels coming soon‚Äù will appear! I‚Äôve maxed out my faves. üòÖ"
5,Galley1323,"It was a good test getting your brain to start working for the day. Some of the questions are pretty easy, but it does get harder as the game goes on, but it is good to get your brain moving for the day."
5,navidawn,I was reluctant at first to pay the price but so glad I did!!  I look forward to the daily training and love all the additional training and activities.  Some make my brain hurt I guess that is a good thing!! üòä
2,NT Preds fan,"Many issues since the recent update. Every single time it takes multiple attempts to get the app to actually open and today, after 10 tries I gave up. Recently when I have been able to get the app to open, I do the three games and then it keeps repeating them.  Update: Issue seems to be resolved."
4,mbdekara,"It‚Äôs been nice to have these games and the ritual of playing them in my day. Some are better for my particular brain than others, but they all help absolve guilt about being on my phone and have saved me from going down news or nonsense rabbit holes!"
4,Kryss Lynnü§ç,"Hey there; ‚ù§Ô∏è       So to be completely honest‚Ä¶ I was pretty hesitant about downloading this app, and paying for it because I am really not a game lover at all.      Surprisingly! After I played a few games, I definitely got hooked, but I do feel its helpful for my brain and also keeps you pretty busy.  Plus, there‚Äôs so many different games to choose from in the app, so in my opinion, I would recommend this to anyone. It‚Äôs worth it.   I highly enjoy it!      I have even got my boyfriend to download the APP  and we sit in bed each playing our ‚Äòfavorite‚Äô game.    -Kryss‚ù£Ô∏è"
5,JefSQ,"Just started and enjoyed the first game.  Short and quick exercises that are both entertaining and beneficial in keeping me quick and accurate, where we often fall in to a routine lifestyle"
5,QueenBee1st,Impulse is a great way to train your brain to make you even smarter than you already years. I love impulse because it teaches you and there‚Äôs fun games on there like drawing online. That‚Äôs my favorite game and it is really fun. Try this app because you will love it.
5,ABEE42,"My brain needs exercise, and this seems to be the way to get it. The game is very colorful and stimulating. That way it encourages you to think fast which I need to do it helps you remember things which is what I am the worst at."
5,NutMeg2.0,These brain games are actually quite fun.  Most brain games can be a bit boring but these I e never really played before  I would most definitely recommend this game to my family and friends
5,kellycidaho,"Have played before and this is my second time using this app. It‚Äôs been improved and I like it better than I did before. Games make you think and at my age, that‚Äôs a good thing!"
5,brother nico,I love this app and all the little mini games it has but the ads can get kinda annoying and I know they need ads to keep the game going but like bro ads in the middle of my game is crazy
5,Diana Moshier,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I took the test and started each exercise! I was worried about the difficulty and honestly, I‚Äôm very happy with the creativeness in which the tests appear. Each day poses another creative challenge! Love it!"
3,Huzaraan,I can‚Äôt pay for it I can‚Äôt afford it I‚Äôm not in a position to pay for it and I really want to continue playing it. I mean I can bury with the ads but paying for it it‚Äôs hard not everyone can‚Äôt afford pay for it so maybe you wanna look at it because I don‚Äôt have money at all to pay for this and I really enjoy this
5,Qwert.io,"I just started playing it and it is pretty fun. Although I am still at the beginning so everything is still very easy. I don‚Äôt know if the game changes in the future, hopefully it gets harder."
5,CNG3731,"I am loving these games so far. It‚Äôs been a great stress reliever, helps me focus on the present and not allow my thoughts to roam or become negative. It has been helping with my anxiety and concentration. I highly recommend anyone of all ages to download this app!"
5,SassySari,"I enjoy working on these at any time of day, but especially during my break at work. When I start to feel tired, I check in, give my brain a quick stretch, and my mind feels energized. It‚Äôs the best."
3,Juggler~1,While I like this app I wish I could get larger text on several of the games. If the game has images it‚Äôs fine but if there is text I struggle to read at my normal speed because even with reading glasses on the font is too small. The app doesn‚Äôt support dynamic text size so it can‚Äôt be changed in settings
5,debdeb11!,I can already tell how my brain is working on different games-It is almost like gaming for kids but not and it is a good coping skill to play to reduce stress. You can‚Äôt think about anything else when your looking for a pair to match lol
5,TJSell,Decent brain training app. It‚Äôs the first one I have ever used and it is very simple to use. It would be better if it didn‚Äôt have all the adds but I will deal with the adds and use the free version
5,Rosewb,I have Parkinson‚Äôs disease and I‚Äôm trying not to develop the dementia that 60% of PD patients get. This app is definitely helping me stay mentally stable and healthy. I am enjoying the process with Impulse. I will continue to use the app for assisting me for the rest of my life . Thank you! Liz Walters‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
5,WhySoDificult!,"Some people read üìï to stay sharp. ü•± Try playing games throughout the day ü§îüòè, THEN wind down with a good üìï. ü´†üõåüí§ You‚Äôd have a more productive day! Unless people ASSume that you‚Äôre SIMPLY playing on your phone rather than üßê WISELY playing on your phone."
5,haylie rye,It is something that has me up in them printing ready to play before I have to get ready for school it makes me feel accomplished I just with it was free to feel even better
5,CelluliteSale,It‚Äôs hard to keep your brain on your toes when you‚Äôre not in school and a learning little facts here and there are good but not a good alternatives.   This helps me a lot and reminds me of when I used to use another app like this.
4,Varun j,Impulse is a good game to play for any age groups  and intents on improving your brain impulse.  One thing was not clear on how the ratings are calculated and also based on the current rating it would he great if it has recommendations of other games to make your brain kore efficient.
5,quickrn04,"I have enjoyed this app so far. It has very interesting and varied games, as well as tests for different brain functions.  I will continue to use this app daily to keep improving my brain functions"
1,YaTTaBai,I just gave you $6.99 for a week‚Äôs subscription then you make me pay $6.99 MORE just to see my IQ score?? What‚Äôs the deal here? My head hurts because I did all that work for absolutely nothing but more begging from you guys. At least 50% of people download this app in the first place because they‚Äôre bored or sad‚Ä¶obviously digging in our pockets every other test/game is off-putting. I‚Äôm appalled. I knew there hard to be a good reason I deleted this app long ago.
5,saivon7,Instead of scrolling on Facebook I use impulse to fill in my free time. I think it‚Äôs 100% worth the download and just to prove my appreciation for it I purchased a year subscription after getting 29% off from a mini game.
5,Jinx.green,Honestly I don't really like most mind games because of adds or because they don't really make you use your brain. But this game calms me when I'm feeling down and makes my brain feel refreshed.
1,JakeOnHisPhone,"They advertise quizzes but at every turn they want you to get their craziest newest deal for their yearly subscription. You will then find you can‚Äôt even take the quizzes even if your subscribe with a free trial  For an app that is designed to help cope and mitigate the symptoms of ADHD, seems like this app is intentionally capitalizing on its weaknesses. For example they give you shining present animations with newer deals, and when you try to reject it the App guilts you.  This is absolutely a psychological ploy to give you a burst of dopamine and then fear of missing out, and take money from those who may have poor impulse control.  Honestly disgusting, what the business is doing with this app isn‚Äôt just bad, it‚Äôs actively malicious."
5,Co-Pilot85,I feel like it‚Äôs at least 90% accurate. I answer quickly when taking the test and I feel that helps. I training games are entertaining to me. I have an analytical mind and this is very interesting.
5,Jstacy44,I like how it seems easy but I can also feel myself ‚Äúworking‚Äù to get the answers. So it feels like I‚Äôm really exercising my brain! It has helped me concentrate better at work and at church. I‚Äôm retaining information much better.
5,jendecide,"There‚Äôs so many different mini games that target different weaknesses you might have, honestly at this point I don‚Äôt care if it helps with cognitive development, it‚Äôs a really fun and colorful game I‚Äôll probably be stuck playing forever."
5,JESUS LOVER #1 FAN,Impulse is I good game especially for elementary kids. It‚Äôs helps them learn and have fun while doing it. And they are timed with everything so it really makes it challenging but fun at the same time. I recommend any parents with little kids to use impulse. K-6
1,TheKayWren,They claim it‚Äôs free but has in-app purchases but you can‚Äôt actually do anything in the app without agreeing to pay. There is a free trial period of 3 days that you have to go in and cancel manually. Then after trying out the app they offer you a subscription whose wording is not made clear that there is NO option for a refund.  I feel very duped and disappointed and do not feel like the games live up to the ad.
5,Best tacoo ever,A fun game that replaced half the games on my phone all while providing a unique way of tracking progress and improvement in skills. A good challenge that can feel like a brain massage. Highly recommend it
5,FocusMindedPhoto,I like to take my daily challenges during the day to stay off social media apps during down time.  Seeing my ratings against others helps me focus on the areas I‚Äôm weaker.
5,oooof1010,"Well designed, clear instructions, engaging, simple but challenging, short convenient game play for anyone with that oh so common problem nowadays: time confetti. So easy to knock of a round or two waiting in line or in a spare moment where ever it may occur. Awesome üëçüèº"
4,Chlo-Chlo_Chanel456,I love this app. I just got it today and it is super fun. It trains my brain and makes me think outside the box. I recommend this app for learning and fun. The one problem is that there are adds every 10 seconds. I don‚Äôt really like that but I guess it teaches you how to be patientüòÑ
5,Olive Oil 793,"We tend to take care of our skin, hair, internal body but we tend to forget about our minds. My mind will be healthier this year because of the exercises Impulse will throw at me. Do yourself and your mind a favor‚Ä¶..download impulse. You will be glad you did."
5,Tiffanic3,I really love this type of training game.  I love that they show you your stats compared to others as well.  I like that it helps to keep the mind sharp.  Definitely a game you should check out for sure!!
5,Averyboyer,This game is amazing it helps take me out of my funk and unfogs my brain and helps refresh my mind and I especially love that it‚Äôs free! I might get the upgraded service when I can afford it but developers keep it up you‚Äôre doing an amazing job
5,Gabealorp,"I‚Äôm a pre med student currently, this helps me re focus after a long test or research paper and or gathering statistical data. I enjoy the puzzles along with the matching aspects. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to challenge/ help themselves."
5,jayelie,If you want to improve your focus memory problem solving  math or language in anyway you‚Äôll want this app believe meüíØü§åüèæüëçüèæüëåüèæüíØonly used for a month and I feel like I improved on a good amount of things already‚Ä¶
5,Johnny6590,"If you don‚Äôt have 10 minutes a day to keep yourself sharp with this great app you are not using all of your brain then. Keep your mind sharp, download this app and try and start using 100% of your brain üëåüèª"
5,^~gamerannie~^,"I think this game is great if you get stressed a lot! It‚Äôs like a fidget toy, it helps relieve your stress and it‚Äôs super fun and relaxing. It also helps you to increase some of your math skills and be able to answer math questions quicker! It‚Äôs a great game and go download it right now!!"
5,pretty healthy,I downloaded the app hoping that playing the games would improve my focus. I can‚Äôt say I see a difference after only 3 days but it was fun! Would be nice if the free trial was for a whole week.
5,StormiLadie,Really makes you think and helps quicker decisions. Not boring or slow just wish it could give you some on-site on your way of thinking by how you answer and what you get right
5,ZLUAG,Very fun and relaxing and very much challenging it has a lot of learning tools to refresh your memory or just even to challenge your brain but it‚Äôs super fun and not boring g at all everyday is something new can always go back to your fav ü´∂üòÅ so worth it
5,Valentia,"Awesome app. The games are fun, and I believe this sort of thing, along with proper exercise, sleep and diet, helps keep the brain young. At 64, this really matters. The fact that the games are so enjoyable makes you want to play them often: Fun & functional = win-win."
5,EriceYeager,This app does what it promises. If you clicked the app it‚Äôs for a reason. Give it a try! For my job and overall mental health I hoped this app could help keep my brain sharp! And it definitely does! Thank you so much for helping and keeping this simple yet effective
5,curci96,This app has help me freakin up on a lot of things mentally! Sometimes with my work I don‚Äôt use a lot of the skills that are required in this app and it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm not wasting parts of my brain away
5,TheLanddon,Good brain exercise for memory and something better to do besides just using your phone for social media ‚Ä¶I think everybody should have this app on there phone it‚Äôs really beneficial and keep you on point
5,Doe Bubbles,I am enjoying the benefits of Impulse. I am learning useful information about myself like sharpening my focus and how to improve on other skills without being intimidated or embarrassed. It‚Äôs like having a personality coach at my fingertips.
5,PDH500,So far I look forward to the daily challenges throughout the day. It‚Äôs a lot better than scrolling mindlessly. I can already see progress in pattern recognition. I can see how it will help keep me mentally sharper.
5,cherish3281,Love this app! The games are fun and challenging enough to keep my brain constantly stimulated and thinking. It also helps me pinpoint my weaknesses and strengths through the self discovery tests which are very important to helping improve myself.
5,Renyren0414,Brain test IQ is very educational for me. Really help me become better cause in school. I got a D. i‚Äôm gonna start playing it every day and I am going to share with friends and family and I hope they give a five star and make a review
5,Roburritoe,"Good way to start your day tbh Start this up in bed and warm up before getting up with this, I feel like this game is a good way to get yourself up to speed as you start your day I see this getting better too"
5,mimikah,The games are enjoyable and I feel like I‚Äôm doing something productive in getting myself into healthy habits. It helps me to finish what I‚Äôve started and not get distracted so easily when I‚Äôm in the process of doing something.
5,auntjuju22,Great game for you brain! it gives you dailey challenges to perform so you can do that once a day and if you‚Äôre not a gamer that‚Äôs all you have to do. if you are a gamer it gives you more game you can play all day as well!
5,parent144,I was looking for a way to keep my mind sharp and I was tired of games that charge you a bunch of money for every game so stumbled into this game and it‚Äôs actually good for your memory and is not that expensive.
5,Landis3014,"Not a lot of things help me calm down when I‚Äôm panicking but this app has done wonders for me, I quit vaping after 4 straight years of vaping, and I've developed a couple healthy habits because of this app and it means a lot to me. Never deleting"
4,Madelyn ‚ô°Ô∏é,I love Impulse I have only had it for two days but there are SO many adds. After I play a game and the first thing when I get out I see an add. The add is the same one the whole time and it is just Farm Life adds. But everything else is perfect.
5,Ieydhdjsowidjxh,"The games you play are actually set up for YOUR levels in how you do, and works to build you up from there. It‚Äôs very fun to play, and actually helps you build the skills it says it‚Äôll help you with. 5 stars!"
5,Playa 1224,"I‚Äôve been noticing my inability to remember things like I used to and have been losing things. I‚Äôm hoping this will help me improve on both of those  flaws, while having fun doing it! Definitely recommend."
2,BaylorMom-9,"Please PLEASE fix the issue in Candy Sort.  There are levels I have completed, I finish the next level or two or more then randomly it‚Äôll take me back a few levels and want me to rework them. I enjoy Candy Sort. It is definitely one of my favorites, but I do not want to rework levels I have passed. For example: I am on level 799, but now it is wanting me to rework levels 795 and 797!"
4,You guys are so anonymous,I love this game so far! It‚Äôs amazing!I think it‚Äôs a little bit to easy for me but it‚Äôs not that hardly anything not to be rude or anything. I wish it had no adds. I‚Äôm sorry if this has hurt you. But this game is so much fun to play and has so many different kinds of games to play.
2,AgeAngel,"I love this app! I‚Äôve been playing daily nonstop, my only issue it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs glitches and has reset my streak twice. The first one it did it at 24 days and now at 81 days. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but it‚Äôs a bit frustrating since the streak is a nice way to stay competitive and it gives you a nice daily challenge. I‚Äôve reached out to support but have gotten no response."
5,The cancer 6/30,I‚Äôm struggling with my memory & just being on point and today is the first day I played some of the activities and I feel improved. I feel like I can tell what I need to work on and what I‚Äôm good at. 10/10 recommend.
5,TBI worker,I love Impluse brain game because I am a brain injured person! These games really tax my brain and make me think!! They are sweet with their critiques too! I value being able to play games that are helping me with my disability at the same time! Thanks for this App!
5,jazzzz:D,this app is by far the most amazing app it keeps my brain working but at the same time it expands in many different ways when it come to learning
4,T.Clovax,"It is a nice app to challenge my older brain, although very easy I‚Äôm assuming when purchased it can be harder or you can choose other modes. The price seems right if the rest of the app continues to expand upon what I experienced in the first 15 min"
5,niszie,It‚Äôs a great game ! I was unable to focus for the past few weeks and this is surely helping . The games are designed very well and they‚Äôre not a repetitive pattern so the keep one engaged well in it ! Good app for sure and great for growing kids too.
3,Bamcar1,"I enjoy the game but today when I came to play the game, it had logged me out and so now I have the frustration of playing games that are at the very beginning with none of my progress saved. The frustrating part is also that I don‚Äôt see a way to login and get back my information."
5,adog126112,The program makes it fun since you see how you compare to the rest of the users who have tested.  It makes you want keep going to see how quick you can keep your brain reacting!
5,@little_brrri,"I do love the app. It has fun brain games, quizzes you can take to determine your personality and archetype, puzzles, etc. You do have to pay for it, but it gives you a discount for the first year. To me it was worth it at the discounted price."
3,Mr. Church,"If you are looking for something to fill the hole left behind from Brain Age on the DS along with making some of the absurd hours of screen time accrued feel productive as opposed to habitual, Impulse is a fantastic option. I‚Äôm also a sucker for personality/archetype tests (it‚Äôs like my astrology) and I like to reward myself with a bit of that after I do some brain games."
1,Nanami Ford,"It says 3 days free, so I agreed to pay whatever that was AFTER 3 days, and when I gave away all of my personal information and thoughts on the tests, it now asked me ‚Äúdo you wanna pay $30 to see the result?‚Äù, so I thought that was the part of 3 days free trail anyway, so I clicked yes and checked the results that I deserve.  Now they charged the $30, that means there is NO 3 days free trial. Very scam. Stay away. There are many phycological test like this FOR FREE."
5,Brandileigh3,Impulse has a variety of games. All of which are challenging but fun. The additional quizzes for IQ and Left/Right Dominance are also fun and the results are interesting. Impulse has been a wonderful stress relief and I look forward to my daily challenges.
5,oh shoot!,"This app is great to help keep your mind sharp, and also to challenge you to open up some creative ways of thinking and perceiving. Plus it just a fun challenge. Like having a personal workout trainer for your brain."
5,Amogusgamer5,"This is a great way to build up your brain, with a versatile mixture of simple and complex exercises that will help you monitor your progress, and maintain your progress and productivity. Would recommend you to give it a shot"
5,vee 8 ),I‚Äôve got a few test that I have to say I didn‚Äôt realize I still remember how to do those things and I‚Äôm speaking about the order of operations . The app  exercises my memory.I feel better after I use the app.
5,Chris0nTopOfHer,Love the mental challenges of everyday use! Really is designed for your needs and can be utilized to work every part of your brain all you need is between 5-20 mins a day for something challenging. Best suited for Critical thinking skills and analyzing situations. Awesome!
5,Willowstar13,I absolutely love this game it is so helpful I play it 24/7 the only downside is that I have to pay to get some games but other than that it‚Äôs so fun it helps so much you should definitely try it have fun
5,Gen720,I never found an app that genuinely feels like it‚Äôs training my brain all AND be enjoyable until this app! It has a variety of categories and mini puzzles/games to play from which is something I really love!
2,lms0419,"I could see this getting good when you move up to more challenging levels but the beginning ones are too easy, wish you could skip levels. For something so easy it‚Äôs not worth sitting through 30 second ads every minute or so to move onto the next level which isn‚Äôt very engaging, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll wait it out."
1,Demian64,Don‚Äôt fall for it. Can‚Äôt imagine how this is so highly rated. Doesn‚Äôt demonstrate any value. Only option is a ‚Äúlimited trial‚Äù that you know will wind up with a likely annual fee despite them giving monthly pricing. I tire of mental and physical fitness apps that don‚Äôt demonstrate value that are only using tried and true methods that prey on peoples inattention and busy lifestyles. PROVE your worth then ask for payment.
5,nikkismilea,"I‚Äôm netesd of crushing fruit you can make your brain sharper while waiting in the doctors office,.. or all those in between moments we‚Äôre all mindlessly crushing fruit! Love this game! I can feel the workout on my cognitive, LOVE IT!! Need more!"
5,amreyes965,Starts simple and becomes more challenging each time. Great way to keep your mind sharp and focused! You can pick the type of problems you‚Äôd like to solve which I love compared to other brain games.
5,Widiurs,"Just started playing and am very impressed with the graphics, versatility and intuitive user interface. Prime example on how an app should be designed. Games are fun and offer enough difficulty levels even for the Einsteins (not me!!!)."
5,Doringnotboring,This is is a way better use of the few minutes it takes to sharpen the mind rather then getting sucked into a scrolling binge on social media
5,Debioutlaw,Definitely challenges my mind/ brain. I‚Äôve been questioning my cognitive skills lately and coming across this app helps me think harder and test my brain!!  I feel like it can only help and improve my aging mind!
5,jasonmb2020,"I am not the play games on the phone person, but Impulse hooked me. Now I‚Äôm not bored on the phone when trying to find something to do. I just got right away into this app. Highly recommended."
3,JonathanLawson,This app is not free you need premium to access everything and even if you have the trial on you can‚Äôt access everything which is just flat out irritating. What you can access is 5 star worthy however so I suppose if you have the money to throw around this is for you.
5,Izzy081230,I Love this app so much I have improved so much ever since I started it. I love all the challenges it gives me and I‚Äôm 13 but it‚Äôs still so fun and it helps me focus and do math faster and other things like that. 10/10 totally recommend.
5,SargentK.,I downloaded this app Impulse 3 days ago and it‚Äôs fun and challenging You‚Äôll even learn a thing or two while your having a blast playing‚Ä¶so many games to choose from you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
5,Marlaina Jade,I‚Äôm normally not one to pay for apps but this is definitely worth it. The games are fun and not super hard. Hard enough to make you think but also enjoy them.
5,Ufcchick71,I have played many of the games and puzzles.  They are so fun and challenging!  It‚Äôs a great way to redirect the mind if you have trouble letting things go or need to stop thinking about something unpleasant.  Did I say challenging?!  Best part is the challenge.
5,Skoo Sully,"I have only just begun to play the games in this app and I am already hooked! Will come back to update after I have been using it for a while, but so far 10/10 definitely recommend!"
5,losregalado,Similar games to ones I‚Äôve seen from the best of research teams. Curious to see if I get any insights or tests without the paid version tho.  We shall see.  Still worth the download even if it‚Äôs just a few free (and ad-free) games a day.
4,itstime12,"I‚Äôm only on day two , I really like the games , they do challenge me . I am looking forward to seeing if I noticed improvement in 30 days . I always see and hear things about diet and exercise but not enough about keeping the brain healthy too ."
5,LeahBeeeuhh,I cannot put this app down! I bought it the first day I tried it. It seriously feels like a workout for your brain. Like I‚Äôm getting smarter by the minute! So fun! Highly recommended!  Only suggestion: add more fun facts/health tips/brain health information!
5,meenoig,Impulsive is the best app to help with memory and learning so far! It‚Äôs very fun and useful. I would recommend it to all ages that would actually be able to comprehend what it‚Äôs asking! Be careful this game is easily addicting. The ads are to help.
5,BLAQUER THAN WITE,"I definitely enjoy keeping my mind busy! I definitely enjoy keeping my mind busy!  My moma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, Forest they‚Äôll be gone before you get the box!"
5,BearLife31,Really liking the app so far after 1 week of downloading. It really makes you use skills that you don‚Äôt really use on a daily basis. Highly recommended and make sure to just take it one day at a time‚Ä¶ as it should be.üòÉ
5,Scarlett Longstocking,Oh this has been such a great source of brain exercise because the games are all different and a good variety is posted daily. Each day is a different group of games which keeps things fresh.
5,peeperslayer9000,"It made my brain grow so large it made me find the cure for cancer and it made my brain. Become mega mind I was even able to rip out my pancreas and make an artificial one. Then next, I became Einstein and started twerking superficous definiously and next, I started gaining the powers of Gojo and became a Gojo supremos."
5,VividDreams,I enjoy the exercises this app has to offer! I might be purchasing full premium to see my progress. I will want to come back in a month and leave another review to see any improvements on myself.
4,MisSaydeez,I‚Äôve never been one for playing game on my phone but I love the thought process of the app. I love that it engages your mind instead of just mindlessly playing a game with no purpose. I also enjoy that the challenges are all different and get harder as you go!
4,fotogirl2009,I like this app a lot. The only thing that I find lacking is that it‚Äôs kind of sensitive in some games and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòread‚Äô my responses accurately. Particularly the line drawing game. I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone who likes brain training and puzzles though. I‚Äôm glad I bought it.
5,Les192526,I‚Äôm getting older and want to make sure I exercise my brain. ‚ÄúUse it or lose it‚Äù so I‚Äôm using it and this game helps that and makes it fun while doing it! I want to keep playing even after doing my daily tasks!
4,wooiljin,"I just downloaded this app, but it‚Äôs a great way to test your brain, stay sharp and entertained while in the go. I‚Äôd recommend this for anyone who‚Äôs had enough of candy crush type games, and wants to upgrade to something that gets your brain to workout."
5,Ajax983,I spent 5 weeks in a coma in 2019 and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not as sharp as I was before so doing these exercises via fun games really helps keep me focused and it‚Äôs helped improve my memory and other fundamental skills! Highly recommend!!!
5,GBPmama,I can already tell this is helping me dive into the things that usually make me so frustrated frustrated. I can wait to keep going and see how well it works over time.
3,GamerGirl3020,The impulse app was very useful to me because I had games I enjoyed playing and helped me with my problems until you now have to pay to play most of the games which is kinda stupid in my opinion because now all the good games in my opinion are for money and now I don‚Äôt use the app anymore it was good before now it‚Äôs not
2,rm0113,"After 3 days, you have to get a membership ($7/week or $50 for lifetime) which is ridiculously expensive for brain games. In order to start an additional 3-day trial, you still have to subscribe..  Also, the game that is advertised (with the rings) is NOT one of the games. I did enjoy the ones offered, but they have the same games for free on the PEAK app.   Loved it at first, but now the developers are just greedy. üòî"
5,DeezyZir,"Versatile, quick, rewarding, easy to use, The combination of matching my goals, with the level of training, equips my mental health and agility with new skills and abilities. Compile all of that with just sheer, simple fun, makes IMPULSE a solid of a kind brain game. Helps me improve mental health and acuity, and recovery."
5,lanie aliza,I spend a lot of time on the app and look forward to the days new challenges/puzzles etc also helps me not spend so much time scrolling on social media. It helps me feel accomplished and sharp minded
4,Darkway6,I don‚Äôt enjoy the ads and the fact that I have to pay I hope one day they don‚Äôt add a lot of ads and also take away the need to pay for more mini games and test :) overall I enjoy playing this games
5,Goodonya00,I am between jobs and was looking for something to assure myself and my ability to think strategically.  This app has given me inspiration knowing my brain is still very sharp!
2,quacker1392,You have to pay to get any of the test or quiz reports. They don‚Äôt even tell you you won‚Äôt get results until you‚Äôve spent 10 minutes on a test only to get no results without payment. Not worth the time if you‚Äôre not going to pay. They should just charge for the app and call it a day.
5,HonestReviewer_100,"Ended up spinning the wheel during my trial & got like 75% off or more for the year, so purchased the year. I‚Äôm loving the tests and the  daily trainings! App works great, no issues so far, & I feel great knowing I‚Äôm keeping my brain sharp every day! üòå"
5,Doodlecotton,It has really helped me out with my ability to pay attention and get things right. Also it has helped me with algebra which I never understood before. I got it first time they explained it to me. Thanks impulse!!
5,Ariana13372,So Aunt told me to get this game and she said I was 10 she said that I couldn‚Äôt play this game and then she realized that I almost be all the 14 year old just from playing that game. You should definitely download it. You‚Äôll be smarter in a snap. üéâüéâüéâüéâ
3,jackrabbit3,It‚Äôs OK but not a lot of feedback and doesn‚Äôt guide how to improve performance some of the games are a little boring. I prefer elevate. That game is miles above this one.  It is quiet so you can play while waiting at the doctors office.  But I‚Äôm adding a star for their IQ tests and psychoanalysis exams for self-discovery. That‚Äôs unique. Worth trying but room for improvement.
5,Kate-e-o,"Every effort to keep my brain sharp is worth it. Some of the games are extremely simple, while others are a bit more challenging either way, I will continue practicing."
2,MTEN14,"Even through several updates, there are persistent glitches that sometime affect playability completely, and they‚Äôre never the same glitch after updates.   Results on some of the games/tests also seem skewed up or down as the sample size is bound to be pretty small, statistically.   If I hadn‚Äôt paid for the discounted year, I‚Äôd delete it."
5,Mcdtwin87,With being diagnosed with Epilepsy and coming out of a two month coma I had fear of memory loss. Constant seizures and medication adjustment to adjust treatment gave me constant fear. This program boosted my confidence to show myself that I am in the highest percentile of my peers.
5,kekes korner,Been playing it for 2 days now I like all the fun little games it has and I can feel it keeping my brain sharp has a lot to offer under the free version would recommend
5,Ednolbca,"I‚Äôm really enjoying this app. Lots of different games and quizzes. Some are fun, some require more thought. I‚Äôm hoping there will be more quizzes about myself because they are thought provoking and give me personal insight."
5,Ashley likes pink,"I just started today and I‚Äôm already feeling good. I would recommend this app for people with AD-HD like myself, it really helps me with lots of things that I‚Äôm struggling with. It is just and awesome app."
2,Needs a better nickname,"The variety of games, puzzles and tests attracted me to this app. It worked great at first but as I got through more levels in the games, I started encountering problems like the app hanging in between levels and not seeing all levels. I reported the issues more than once but never heard back. It‚Äôs extra disappointing because it was so exciting at first."
5,shhdjdjdbdh,I have ADHD and Depression and Anxiety has been through the roof the app has been extremely helpful I plan on staying on top of this stuff so I can get my mental health and focus/listening to instructions better
5,SamiSue82,It gives you a percentage compared to others.  I am not sure if it‚Äôs accurate however I enjoy it telling me I‚Äôm smart.  Haha love the activities everyday and look forward to it during breaks in the day.
5,Meredith103,I like to start the day with Impulse training to keep my mind sharp. Some of the games are fun so I go back to those throughout the day. It definitely helps me reset and come back to work with more focus.
5,Ervdoggg,This is my first time trying something like this since brain age in the 2000‚Äôs. It‚Äôs definitely got some difficulty to it that gradually builds your mental capacity for memory. This is worth 5-15 minutes of everyday if not more.
5,BCHILL13,Really great for daily use. Notifications aren‚Äôt too buggy and it actually gets me excited to play the little games ü§£. I‚Äôve also started feeling more sharp and attentive since playing everyday.
4,t71636382927474929,"For those who want to use their time wisely. When you have the time to sit and diddle on a game why not make it one to better the mind. Extremely fun, easy to get going, just wish it was all free, but I still appreciate what they bring to the table."
5,raygaytv,"I‚Äôve been looking for ways to keep my mind sharp, since i spend so much time on my phone might as well use my brain, but also make it fun ü§∑üèæ. This app was the perfect way."
5,TamiTrue...,I have tried and many brain training apps but Impulse is the best.  The variety of challenges is impressive and the no-nonsense scoring makes it so much more fun.   I look forward to my daily training session everyday.
5,KingMare98,This app has been my brain food now and each time I see it pop up I want to feed my brain with something productive. This gives me a chance to do so and I‚Äôm glad I came across it.
1,Dlisad,"I purchased a year subscription. I enjoyed using app and advancing my experience scores.   Then I was logging on after ten days straight. App told me I had to log on again???   I did and it reset everything. Everything was lost, I have to start from scratch. It‚Äôs aggravating , I  would like to delete the whole thing but it‚Äôs paid for a year.  I hate to start over just to lose it all again!  Is there a fix for this?"
5,Shawn a.k.a pilliger,I look forward to the random training daily. The mixture of different mental exercises is stimulating for me and usually draws me into spending 10+ minutes playing random games each morning.
5,hayden 821,If you wanna stop wasting ur time playing games on ur phone or even scrolling on social media this would help u spend that time instead working on different puzzles and games designed to make ur brain work
5,Doan_er,This app is fun to play and easy to pick up. There is a wide array of fun and simple game to engage your brain and improve mental aptitude. I enjoy playing every day and finding out about how my brain works and tips to how to learn based on my personality and archetype.
5,t1oreo,I like it because the exercises are unique and informative. I‚Äôm not sure how this helps boost memory and focus but it‚Äôs more productive than playing video games that have no impact to personal growth or level of knowledge.
5,.GB.70,"The activities so far are pretty simple. But however simple or difficult, it‚Äôs great exercising my brain, stimulating areas of my mind to react to everyday images or actions that allows me to figure out why I react in one way or another."
5,Taniaüå∏,"Absolutely love this app, have been using it for about 3 years. It is very relaxing but I want my son to use it on his iPad.   QUESTION: Is family sharing available? I cannot get any information online."
5,Goldberry77,"As a beginner, I don‚Äôt know how much I like the games overall.      But I love that they are easy at first. I can do them at my own pace, make errors, and still feel good. Haven‚Äôt made any errors except in pre-game tutorials.      So far, it‚Äôs very good."
5,ivyjem,"It‚Äôs a game changer for me, I‚Äôve tried many games and this one seems to work for me. Especially with my attention span I see a difference when I‚Äôm working on a project I‚Äôm able to focus for longer a time."
3,sukoyoso,"I really enjoy the activities and questionaire‚Äôs on this app but i don‚Äôt apperciate being forced to pay to review every single report/analysis after the completion of said activities. I completely understand that money is required to keep it going but just to view one report, come on, theres more than enough ads."
5,MTRisner,"This is the best brain training app on the planet! You not only get daily training to keep your brain fast and fresh but you get other tests like left rain/right brain, ADHD, IQ tests and so much more. I highly recommend you try it!"
5,Debbi J.,This app is affordable and it‚Äôs excellent!! If your trying to exercise your memory and other mental skills and it‚Äôs fun so you can more easily keep using the app to keep your brain in shape for years!! There‚Äôs a 1 year plan that‚Äôs affordable too.
1,Rashu123,I wanted to try the app and it took me straight to trial of 3 weeks. Once u r on the plans page I pressed the back button coz I didn‚Äôt even want to do the trial but it registered me for trial. Then I couldn‚Äôt find the unsubscribe option. It wasn‚Äôt in the subscriptions page in settings nor anywhere on app. I had to write to support email on app and waiting for response.  Games were ok.
5,Ashyyyy girllll,Hello my name is ash and I am just going to say I got this game yesterday and it is so much fun and I mean so much fun this is my day two and I love that I can have my memory my fastness and more improved imma give you guys a five star rating cuz you guys have an awesome/amazing fun andUniquely civilized game
5,WestlandSelfie,Just getting started and I‚Äôm already appreciating the challenges. It starts off super easy and makes you earn your way to higher levels. Just as you would do in the gym.
5,bibbiddi bop bop bop,"It has everything that I like, it has math, it has memory games, it even helps you with attention! If I could I would rate 12 star! This doesn‚Äôt just train your brain,  it‚Äôs also fun! That‚Äôs why I rate this game 5 stars."
5,Latonskii,"Daily brain exercises, interesting surveys, and fun free games! Honestly it‚Äôs a great time waster and definitely makes good brain food. Only issue is the fact that you have to pay for a lot of the features, but it‚Äôs still pretty cheap."
1,AAndrew,"This app looks like it has some fun brain games, and after being bombarded with ads on IG, I figured I would give it a whirl.   Tries to get you to sign up for a subscription before you even play it, then offered me 92% off after playing a few samples.   One star for the deceitful pricing structure. I would buy it outright if that were an option, but the only option was constant access to my bank account."
5,Ch√©47,"I love Impulse, the mind games are great and help keep me sharp. But I especially love the tests and quiz‚Äôs, they help you learn about yourself and so far I‚Äôve been asked questions that really expand my way of thinking. I hope I continue to reap the benefits of this awesome app!"
5,Charlie&Cash2022,I love doing this app when I wake up because it‚Äôs helps me wake up for 1 and because it helps me think better sometimes I will get aggravated if I can‚Äôt figure something out but it just helps me do better!
5,U.M.I.S.G,I saw this game on tiktok and thought it would cost money and won‚Äôt let you play untill you pay but you can play even if you don‚Äôt want to pay and they have really fun games!!!
5,nun yo buz wax,"I love this app sm, I go on it all the time I have been m on this app for 1 week and love it. They say it helps your brain sharpen which is really cool. These hard puzzles are so much fun to solve. There are adds but not a lot which is cool. You need to get this app I‚Äôm being Fr."
5,Aol addict,"Doing this stimulates your brain to give you the same energy as if you were going to the Gym and having a full workout with your body , except for your brain ‚Ä¶"
5,Cherxoxo,I love it I‚Äôm 64 and where I‚Äôm usually working I‚Äôve been off lately I‚Äôd like to think I still have my wits about me when I do your game it lets me know where I‚Äôm at so to speak I feel better when I‚Äôve done well!!    My sincerest remarks!! Cher Mack aka Rodrigues
5,GE-Sa'Linda,I really enjoy this app it actually makes you use your brain. I think of it as brain exercise. We work hard to keep our body‚Äôs in shape so why not do the same for one of our body important organs?
5,dfijewski,I knew that my cognitive skills were waning and I‚Äôve been looking for a simple yet fun way to work on sharpening them. This app has done just that while also showing the extent of my cognitive decline. This is easy and fun enough to keep going.
5,Number1pimp,"I really enjoy the slight anxious feeling that this gives me from completing timed quizzes. It‚Äôs kind of psycho, but I‚Äôd rather like this over getting praised for doing stiff motions that have absolutely nothing to do with the song that I‚Äôm mouthing along to then explaining that my career is that."
5,Jay Namaste 8,"It‚Äôs quick, easy and fun! I‚Äôve read that unpredictability, flowing activity like ballroom dancing and crossword puzzles can prevent Dementia and keep you sharper longer.   This is that, in less time, on your phone and with more variety!"
5,drphiljr,"Have been enjoying the games since purchasing the app. Can get sucked into playing, but that better than scrolling social media apps. Wide variety of games, which keeps you challenged."
5,LarryBoy Fed,"After COVID I had bad ‚Äúbrain-fog.‚Äù Lost for words and forgetting something that was JUST NOW TALKED ABOUT reoccurred regularly.  These exercises are fun, frustrating at times, and appear to be slowly helping my cognition/memory already.  My wife has noticed it too.  Thank you!!!!!"
5,Sa-Clori-A,"It‚Äôs a fun game to keep a woman like me on her toes, it‚Äôs good to know what your  average brain speed should be based on your age. It‚Äôs challenging to see how the accuracy is on each level it helps you to improve yourself. The ball sort game is Also my favorite"
5,screw insta,"I didn‚Äôt think I would use this game when I found it, but I am hooked! I can see my brain working differently and sharpening my skills while playing a game is hands down the best way to go for mg ADD brain. I love it!"
5,Slaytanic Warmonger,"The variety is what makes it great, but it‚Äôs overall very well thought out. I‚Äôve tried other apps but this is the one that will last without getting boring.  Highly recommend it!"
5,LaBoA666,"Just like we work out our body we should work out our brain!  The app give you from walking to sprinting, all kinds of workouts to train your brain.  That‚Äôs what it takes to keep it young and sharp!"
5,minnnnnnnnaaaaaaa,Impulse is such a fun & addictive game. Simple but challenging all at the same time. Love the brain refresher it gives you. Even my daughter loves it who is only 8. It has helped her learn division & multiplication quickly. Give this game a try & you definitely won‚Äôt regret it !!
2,RKSem89,I didn‚Äôt want to pay a subscription for brain training but I enjoyed playing their games for free. The ads finally got too annoying so I caved an paid $5 to have ads removed‚Ä¶ only to discover the $5 only removed ads from one of the games. So I‚Äôm stopping this app. There are plenty of other puzzle-type game apps that don‚Äôt constantly ask for more money.
5,funnygirl511,"I finally found an app that helps me to focus, and also helps with memory and logic skills. The best part of it is that it‚Äôs fun too! I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to improve their brain function."
5,Kelly M. Henry,"I love this app because the short games fit well with my busy schedule. The app contains brain exercises that pull me away from the mind numbing social media consumption vortex, which is a very good thing. I enjoy exercising my brain with this app."
5,hartzdee,"These games are based on psychology and truly help you exercise your brain.   I am done with apps that are mindless or as my son says, are ‚Äúbrain rot.‚Äù   Excellent app and they have a great introductory price so I‚Äôll be playing these well into 2025!"
5,Mamma171,"This is a great app that offers fun and quick games that are helpful for memory, concentrate focus. A bonus is the interesting tests that offer more about your personality and IQ and archetype. Worth the price, and easy to use and follow."
5,AwesomeHandlesForBubba,I love starting my day with a cup of coffee and impulse. I‚Äôve learned so much about my mental health and wide is the way it is as well as coping skills and ways to train my brain to exercise like any other muscle. I recommend this to everyone.
5,AnnieDee1963,"I really like the app. There was an offer of a LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION for 50% off, and I intended to purchase that after checking out the app to see if I‚Äôd like it. Now I cannot find the LIFETIME subscription anywhere. Can I get some help with this, please?"
1,Cyrussssboi,Previously spent money in the game to unlock all features. Now they want me to spend more money as their new update included ads for every action in the game. The game is advertised to ‚Äúunwind your brain‚Äù with a distracting ad every 30 seconds now it defeats the purpose. Don‚Äôt get this app unless you want to spend $100+ to unlock ‚Äúall features‚Äù and on top of that ‚Äúpremium ad free membership.‚Äù Greedy company.
4,Winsomewinona,"Was really liking this app until today! every time I select a game an ad pops up and there‚Äôs no way to X out of it! I tried restarting my phone to see if it quit doing that, but it did not! about to get my money back!"
1,Cisco Kid806,"The game didn‚Äôt work and kept freezing, so I deleted the app and downloaded it again. When I try to log in it tells me my account doesn‚Äôt exist, even though I have paid through October. I tried getting help through customer service but they don‚Äôt respond at all. Apparently this is the only way to get their attention. The game used to be fun, but they are really dropping the ball lately."
5,QTHOGGINGPANTS,Physical health is important. But we never think about the strain that we should put out mind through. I start off every morning with the impulse app to wake my mind up before hopping into a cold shower.
2,Alek2052,"This is overall a good app, but then you have ads almost every 15-20 sec, and usually, I would tolerate it, but having the ads, PLUS have to buy a subscription, I‚Äôd assume that having most of the app behind a paywall would enable it to have no ads, but no, there is restricted content(by paywalls) and ads, choose one, and then, you can‚Äôt use the app offline at all"
5,Whit.walke,I think this app is great! I have adhd and was diagnosed later in life making it hard to understand how to manage in some ways. This app helps relax my brain but understand myself better as well.
3,Krispix318,"I really enjoy the games but holy moly the ads are beyond excessive. As soon as you open the app, BOOM ‚Äúhey sign up for a free trial!‚Äù Between every game or just trying to open a game? Another ad. I realize it‚Äôs a ploy to get folks to pay for a subscription but it‚Äôs not going to happen. I would happily pay a one time cost for the app but not a monthly fee"
5,Hiiiiii_it_me,"Love that the beginning levels are pretty easy and they progressively get more challenging. Pretty interface, user friendly - I got my fianc√© and teen son to download and play! Love all the different tests you can take"
5,Spidernite,I just started so I can‚Äôt say that if I have improved yet but I have heard good things about it I will keep at it I have a issue with simple memory loss like keys. But I can remember historical information.  I hope this help me.
5,Aunt_CC521,I‚Äôm 36 years old and they never had proper treatment for my ADHD‚Ä¶ and I feel less kind of helps you with your memory and hopefully the goal is gonna help me. Focus a bit better and learn to multitask better without medication.
5,Duchess Nadia,Downloaded the app yesterday. Brain-training games are interesting & entertaining; tests present a great opportunity for self-discovery. I feel that my brain is going to become more agile and my attention to details will improve. Love the app!
5,Deborah MB,I experienced a concussion last year and I‚Äôm finding this app extremely helpful in sharpening my cognitive brain skills again!  Highly recommend fun and easy easy to understand how it works.
5,Mommas trying to live,I have had All leukemia and 2 bone marrow transplants within 8 months.i am having brain issues due to the chemo and being septic and in the ICU for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs helping with my brain function. and memoryüò¢üëç
3,GCP.1,"I prepaid for a year subscription. My phone had an issue and as I transfer all files and apps, I attempt to sign into Impulse for my subscription to activate on this new phone. I don‚Äôt have an account according to their website. I tried emailing support and almost 24 hours later, no email. Help."
2,Ma651,I was excited to download this App and eagerly  paid for the annual subscription. That was a mistake. After a few weeks the daily training becomes boring and repetitive which leaves little excitement to do daily training. I am stuck for the year so I am working on the games instead. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did and do the full trial before committing!
1,Cccodie123,"This app is misleading and frequently charges without the full knowledge and consent of the app user.  After reading through reviews, (after downloading, my own fault :( ) it‚Äôs easy to see that multiple people have brought this to the attention of the developers. They are fully aware‚Äî yet they have not made any moves to change this and clearly intend to continue.  This is just a warning, do not download this app."
5,psrest,"I‚Äôve had a brain injury and learned that part of the recuperation is using different brain exercises. This app has a lot of very valuable for the brain, to keep different aspects of it stimulated. I Recommend it."
5,JahSoldier03,"This app has helped me on just two days to think clearly and help with important decisions, I recommend this app to anyone that wants to take control over their own mental activity."
5,Yareli_r,I‚Äôve been using this when I wake up in the morning instead of scrolling through my phone and it really helps me and my brain wake up. It‚Äôs been an amazing tool
5,Chezy69,I have enjoyed the app 75% more than my peers in the same difficulty level. I generally do not purchase apps. I did find this app to be an interesting concept and I am happy with my progress so far.
5,L.L7231,Saw this on a Tiktok ad and thought it was another app that you had to pay a fortune to use. I was wrong. Impulse is a great app to train your brain and improve cognitive functions. Absolutely Honest Review. 10/10 Definitely recommend!
5,goose32,Love the games and challenges they offer to help train and strengthen my brain. I have ADHD and the the quick mind break this app allows me to have is amazing and I wish I could have had this years ago!
5,Supdayna,"I feel like I stopped using my phone because all I would do is scroll aimlessly. I‚Äôm new to this app, but so far it‚Äôs made me feel better about my being on my phone."
5,Yisenia,"I love it! I have Lupus and Fibromyalgia, it‚Äôs difficult to stay alert. I‚Äôve tried different things to exercise my brain, be alert, and healthy. So far, Impulse keeps me alert, engage, and it does work out my mind. I love it so far!"
5,Wild Fires rider,Some parts I scooted right through but then when I got to actual numbers instead of characters I see where I‚Äôm still having difficulty in life.
5,JJJJCCT,Will give the app a go and see where it takes me. If I remember to come to the app and it is able to keep my attention that would be a new thing for me. Stay tuned!
5,Celphalobob,"This game has been so much fun. You will have to purchase a subscription, but it‚Äôs well worth all of the training, tests, and everyday games it gives you in order to engage your brain activity!"
5,girlwiththeeye,"I really do enjoy these games, they are fun easy to understand and I love how it tracks your progress. They aren‚Äôt too long either they are short but you end up doing more not knowing they are taking time."
5,Krystal1031,"This is a great app so far. I have only had it two days so I feel like I will need to write an update. I‚Äôm surprised at my results in the different areas. I hope this does help moving forward, I think it will :)"
4,ooooooggrzfwathim,Overall enjoying this app and I only have the free version. Wish this app tracked across devices. Not sure if i have an account in which i could log into on a new device. Streak did not transfer over when i tried
5,Owl 27 üëåüèΩ,"It‚Äôs a great app to distract yourself for a few minutes and while you are having fun and challenging yourself, you are actually training your mind and improving.  Highly recommend it."
5,seannananannnnaaana,"With all of the different skills the app helps me stay sharp on, I realize how much I use each subject in my every day life. The practice on here has made things a tiny bit easier"
5,Auatua,This is a really helpful app and it‚Äôs fun too but I don‚Äôt have the money to pay for it right now but I understand why they need to have purchases in the app it just makes me a little sad but that‚Äôs besides the point FIVE STARS!!!
4,"kdnd,shodnfn","Impulse is a decent game, although I haven‚Äôt seen any results yet of change in my experience. It does get your mind off of things that you may be stressing about though. And clears your mind. It also makes me know myself better with tests, like an aptidute test, or a adhd test."
5,Msmbsell,I struggle with memory issues as well as a variety of things- in the process of being tested for a lot- so this is good to keep your brain engaged- and I don‚Äôt like games on my phone
5,YouUP?,Easy enough to understand and play. The difficulty moves up steadily and fluctuates throughout the playing process. My want to have it all mind likes the Chang around in between levels and games.
5,ÍÄ≠ÍçèÍà§Íçü,"I actually hate paying for apps, impulse though, is the only exception. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for playing little games on my phone cause they are puzzles! And I can definitely feel myself getting smarter. So addicting."
5,Felipe Huertas 77,"I initially downloaded the all because it was free,  and I was going to deleted it after the free period (third day) But after I finished the first round of activities I  ended up buying all of this in the first 15 mins of training. That‚Äôs how cool the app is."
5,Ralph Martinez III,I stubbled on this app and instantly got hook. I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù games and I quickly got bored of the small selection of games. This game will definitely stay on phone for a while!
5,NateP6126,"This app provides a challenging experience with increasing difficulty as you progress. It‚Äôs quite fun, with the games being simply designed but made to test and push your skills. It‚Äôs like a souls game but for exercising your mindüòÇ"
5,Smiley 00,The games they have are fun and it‚Äôs not to boring it‚Äôs like a lot of mini games. It‚Äôs pretty cool to know thing about your self threw their quiz‚Äôs or tests and the games aren‚Äôt all the same so if you get bored with on you can just switch
5,Irideny,"The UI is so smooth, I just want to keep solving puzzles. The puzzles and difficulty enough to make me think a bit, but not to hard to make me want to quit. A perfect app to pass time while doing some brain exercises!"
3,BrFlann123456789,"So, I get one wrong in last stage of fairly advanced level of game and perform better than 0%. Similar results across the board. App is a hair trigger to either 99% or 0%. Theoretically possible, yes, but likely, no.   Also, no ability to back up to easier levels just to practice if not doing well at harder levels is silly"
5,hdjxh h,This game has helped me see my self in a whole new light. It helps me stay sharp and focused I highly recommend this app to just help you stay sharp and learn about yourself through taking there tests
5,Jada lael,"This application gets me going ! Each game designed to teach you new things about yourself, the knowledge needed and how to expand your thinking in ways you didn‚Äôt know you comprehended . Amazing! I love this friggin‚Äôapp! I‚Äôd recommend impulse any era ü§ûüèæ‚ú®"
4,MR5212,I love how this really works my brain and always gives me something to do. The only reason it‚Äôs not a five is because there are somethings you can‚Äôt do because you have to pay but most of the things you can do so it‚Äôs awesome and I love that it really works my brain
5,Transparency T,Great thing is rather than scrolling through social media and/or playing mind numbing games on an app. Much rather be brain exercising with fun and creative thinking. It very easy at first but then it starts to get more difficult.
5,Oceanwwave,"Helps with memory and pattern, match, recognition, motor skills! FUN NOT BORING OR HARD! Starts out easy and follows your lead with total effort and continues building up your brain and making it process and productive! Train your brain and keep it polished for any task!"
5,Jdjfjdis,I am so happy I got impulse it is helping me with my brain memorizing things and it‚Äôs just fun to do all of that cool puzzles I also like how it tells me how many I got wrong and how many I got right so I can do better next time. Thank you impulse.
5,Kealykae,"If your looking for a training app for the brain this is it! Super fun games that you can‚Äôt stop playing! The app also has little tests that can take you‚Äôve ever wondered about your IQ, learning style, personality type etc.! Worth the download!"
5,ce!!33,"I like the tests, and enjoy the different types of games. I would only recommend they use the data and introduce new challenges and games as they learn what you need"
5,Jason Curry,I‚Äôve tried many of these types of apps over the years and this one is the best designed and functioning and the exercises are not too long.
5,helga.hi,"I really like how this app started me off with easy enough tasks and then gradually got more difficult.  This app offers a lot of different tests, puzzles, and games that can keep any mind busy or focused.  Really loving this!"

5,CAJules,"I recommend this app. Brain health is so critical especially for you in the workplace. This doesn‚Äôt take much time, and really helps your brain get a workout. It‚Äôs not horrendously difficult either."
5,Manaconda Maximo,"This app helps use both sides of my brain at the same time, get to be creative & problem solving ,best or both worlds and actually real games with ability"
5,Ilans S,I have been playing this game for the last few days and really really loving it!  I have seen a few of these type of games and this one has definitely got what I was looking for!! Thank you
5,kidding kynleigh,"It is a really good app. The games push you, where other apps don‚Äôt. This app really knows how to get you to learn something that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to on your own, because it pushes you to the perfect amount."
5,roslimm,impulse is so easy to use correct and obv. has nothing to do with math. it made me feel lesser small and positive about it. Impulse is such a fun tool i use it corresponding to music and passing hours of time when my small bigger children are sleeping.
5,mythoughts2020,I saw ads for Impulse probably fifty times and decided that I‚Äôd try it. I signed up for the weekly and I‚Äôm enjoying it. It doesn‚Äôt feel like work which makes it easy for me to keep going.
5,ramibunch,This has kept my attention and focus better than scrolling! Super fun games that tailor its level to how your doing. They also have workouts with different games that help target different areas. It‚Äôs fun.
5,verifiedAppUser,I enjoy this app because it gives you a space to wine down but also challenges you in a healthy manner to where you don‚Äôt feel like you are not productive at all.
5,Katrinakm,Very well designed. Games and exercises are fun and short enough that you don‚Äôt get frustrated. Instant rewards that keep you coming back for more. Has difficulty level for everyone.
5,marynrose,I‚Äôm not a game person AT ALL but i saw an ad for this && totally fell in love !! it really does keep you thinking and using your brain in the best way. i‚Äôve already bought the lifetime package and can‚Äôt wait for the daily challenges.
5,otter3182,"Outstanding, I love these games it makes you think quickly and react quickly, it starts slow but picks up the more you do it, helps with my concentration and focus, thanks!"
4,gypsyMoon87,"If you can get past all of the incredibly long ads the games are really good. I‚Äôm not on my phone much so I wanted some quick brain games I could play throughout the day, unfortunately the ads take up too much time so I‚Äôm deleting the app."
4,makayla sinpson,I like this game but i thin that it should be more of the trasing thing its really fun to me and i think for others to!! So i would be aneroid to make a change!! I hope you guys have a great day and enjoy your weekend with your family and friends!! Bye hope you love the thoughts that i gave!!.
5,Irishlrd,"Every morning before work, I sit on my porch, enjoy my coffee and do some sudoku to help my mind wake up. I decided to try this and so far, so good. I just wish the adds could be space out in between games."
5,Lv0128,You don‚Äôt need a trial‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs free for all just hit the x if you want to get it it just makes you do extra things anyways‚Ä¶Thanks developers for making this app! I‚Äôm happy and healthy only at the age of 8 Hope you have a nice day bye!
5,Plothhh,"Impulse is the best perfect for my brain. It‚Äôs just outright amazing and it doesn‚Äôt cost money unless you wanna get rid of ads or become a member which you should, but I don‚Äôt wanna since I can‚Äôt pay money"
1,Eri.000,"üíÄ you literally cant use it with ought making a purchase because of how irritating the adds are. A 60 question quizz and every 5 question you get an add that takes 15 seconds away. And I‚Äôm not quite know much about it tests but repeatedly putting the missing piece of what looks like a children‚Äôs puzzle....I don‚Äôt think that will accurately determine IQ. Even if the test was not meant to be realistic neither taken seriously, the adds are killing me!!!"
1,02/17/20,"I Downloaded the app a few weeks ago. Initially it was great but after a few days it was simply not moving to the following day. I haven‚Äôt been able to keep playing the daily games for a week now. I left a feedback through the app and no response, it‚Äôs been a couple of days. Right now I would say it‚Äôs not worth the money and feels like a trap and complete waste of money as the app is not cheap at all. I hope that I am wrong and whatever is going will get fixed."
5,Impulseü©∑ü©∑,"This app has helped me figure out different parts of myself, with all its quizzes and tests to see who I am. The games are so entertaining and fun but they also help with different life skills. Normally I don‚Äôt really love games, but this game is truly incredible!"
5,Leggs4Daz,I really like this app the games get difficult sometimes but it keeps me moving forward and thinking positive. I suggest everyone try this app to see how far they can get.
5,cyaueue50,"I was a bit skeptical, when clicking to try it out, but there were no annoying questions be trying it out. I think this will help with menopausal brain fog. We shall see."
5,Rb_0324,"I just started this two days ago so far I like it. I wish it didn‚Äôt charge so much because I would definitely use all of the features, but we will see how it goes."
5,Joi Harris,"I have a great time on this app! I feel both challenged in relaxed whenever I am completing my training. I struggle with anxiety and ADHD so Impulse is a great way for me to, both, calm down and regain focus. Highly recommend for people of all ages!"
5,7thDaysister,I thought these games and tests would be pretty hard to do for me but most of them were fun to play!! The math was a little bit different so more challenging than I expected. But still a good exercise!!
4,Angela ( angie),"I would recommend this app, the only downfall is the cost. Especially the timing when everyone is going through a hard time with the cost of living.  The short time I was on the app seemed educational.  Understanding more about oneself."
5,Dljuljv,I really love this app because it has so many different games and then personality test and all kinds of really cool stuff even if you don‚Äôt get the premium membership and pay the money the free is just as good
5,88 Pancakes,"If you need something to calm you down, this is definitely the place to go. I have ADHD, and never tried anything like this until I got this game on a whim. Whatever you do, try it everyday! It helps!!!"
5,ValVal9,Only tried it for 2 days so far but it‚Äôs keeping my interest and the games are fun. Love the tests but in order to get detailed results you have to pay the subscription cost.
5,Sorrymsjackon,It keeps me interested and gets the rust out of the gears up top. All in all it‚Äôs fun but to pay for it seems a little ridiculous but I get that you have to get paid like everyone else.
5,Alonzo Emerson,"This app has made a big difference in learning and keeping my brain fresh. It‚Äôs not hard to navigate & it‚Äôs not discouraging,   Perfect app if you would like to keep your brain going in and effective fun way"
5,Blink1982,I really do hope these games are helping my brain. They are not only fun but by letting you know what percentage you are better than your peers it makes it competitive and I‚Äôm all about that!
1,b-rad518,"Could be a great app to have, except of course like everything else it cost money monthly to play it. And if you don‚Äôt pay you get blasted with ads after every game which wasn‚Äôt bad at first because they weren‚Äôt long. But the more I played the longer that ads became. So I got frustrated after watching halfway through a 45 second ad, and came to write this review and delete the game."
4,888AK,I like this app but a test I was really excited to take wasn‚Äôt on here. I kept seeing the ink blot test but it isn‚Äôt on my app. I like the games so i bought it for the year. I am disappointed that the tests are not as advertised though
5,Natuallylovely,I am getting what I hoped for! Thus far this app is great! I am always up to a challenge and try to improve on my mental daily. So having an app like this that‚Äôs ‚Äúhandy‚Äù (üôÉ) is really helpful. I‚Äôm looking forward to more challenges.
5,Theftigeyghkvv,"It helps my mind focus without getting distracted it has a bunch of mini games that you can play and, you can also get a free trial for only so much I used to struggle with mental math but this just helped me 5 stars for sure!"
5,Deb. K. R.,"I had been searching for a free brain-training game and this was the one for me! It has excellent training courses and fun games. WiFi is not needed so it is accessible anytime, anywhere. Impulse was the best choice I could make for a brain-training game!"
5,jacecash,This is insightful and fun. It‚Äôs great for getting a perspective of cognitive ability and improvement in that ability. It‚Äôs nice to know that I can improve my skills with my busy schedule without it being a chore.
5,RAY-GAMES,"This is the best app. I love how they give you games other then daily games. It‚Äôs super fun and good for your brain. I would recommend it if you like playing brain games. I don‚Äôt want to make this long so, that is why you should get it."
5,Babygirl UPT,This game helps with focus and thinking especially as you get older. When you want to pass time and feed your brain it‚Äôs great a to keep up with how things are changing.
4,LMIVXX,"I love the app but since the latest upgrade, there are games that don‚Äôt function well - Pass the ball is one example. It opens fine, gives you instructions, etc. but nothing happens when you tap the tiles."
1,MarieSTL,"After downloading and then answering a bunch of questions, this so-called ‚Äúfree‚Äù app still wouldn‚Äôt let me play any games without forcing me to sign up for either a paid plan, or a ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial that costs money after a few days. I didn‚Äôt choose any, and when trying to close the app, it signed me up for the trial. I did NOT agree to this, so if I get charged through my Apple account, I will report this fraud to the FTC and every agency possible."
3,Duh - rell,"I love this game, but in Candy Sort the levels don‚Äôt track correctly. For example, I played 5 levels in a row, left the game, and when I came back it didn‚Äôt count two of the levels forcing me to have to redo them. This sort of thing happens regularly."
5,haxzerer,"I turned my phone black and white. Deleted all my socials. The only app i use when i'm bored now is the impulse app.   This app honestly trains your brain and it's better then tiktok, snapchat, instagram and facebook. Why scroll on your phone for an hour when you could be training your brain.   And for the people complaining about it costing money, Be grateful they charge $30 for a lifetime pass, they could've easily made it $50-$60 and I would still pay.   Great app. 9.8/10"
2,CarrieLizz94,"Really weird that the first 3 tests it gave me I got better than 90%, 98%, and then 99% of my peers; THEN it asks you to commit with a discount off.  Almost like those stats are fibbed to make you feel good about yourself. I‚Äôd love to see what other people actually make on those tests, and if everyone gets the ‚Äú92% off‚Äù present right after, too. üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I mean, smart, Impulse. I‚Äôm sure you get a lot of people with these tricks."
4,Not mine 333,"I‚Äôm enjoying the app but as everything else it‚Äôs not until you sign up that you discover that unless you pay you only get to try 3 games. How can people aford to pay $5+/month for every app they use? Anyway, $6.89 is a hefty fee for a game."
5,TACsdk,This is my second day of Impulse. What I like about it is I turn off the tv and sit in quiet to play the games. It truly shows me how distracting TV and my phone are. Hoping to continue improving my memory.
5,lexim717,"Great for us old people trying to keep our brain power flowing. lol Only a few days playing, but worth the little cost so far. I feel like it‚Äôs good for my anxiety as it puts my mind in a more productive place. üòâ"
2,kathyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,It‚Äôs a great game for flexing the mind muscles but I don‚Äôt understand why I need wifi to play it. It just makes more sense to be able to play this offline because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm playing with other people. Very disappointing. Also the adds are after every game and sometimes twice in a row. I‚Äôd pay for ad free but because it required wifi it‚Äôs not worth it.
5,Tiffles0807,"So much more than just a game. Helps you exercise your brain and understand how your brain works. Specifically programs to you and your type of learning, setting up specific goals for yourself."
1,Angryginger8008,"You cannot do anything in this app without a subscription. Find a quiz you want to take? Great, spend X minutes completing, only to find at the end your results are held hostage by a subscription fee. There are a million other resources that will give you the same information without constantly hounding you for money. That said, kudos to marketing - I was the idiot who clicked the link into this hellhole in the first place."
4,PIN3@PPL3,"This game is a really go way to find out things you might not have known. It also a good way to keep your brain sharp. I would recommend it to somebody that doesn‚Äôt know if they should get the game, it is not just a game but an experience and exercise."
4,Crossfox1,So far I like it but I chose to pay 39 dollars for the year and got charged 51 dollars. I‚Äôm not certain what‚Äôs going on with apple and I can handle a few more dollars but I don‚Äôt much like not having the choice of what I‚Äôm paying. üòíI better get the lifetime membership ‚Ä¶
5,Pearceyourheart,"I really like this app. It‚Äôs helping me train my brain for better performance. I like that it is challenging and helps me to focus more and helps me to concentrate to be more efficient.   I paid for a lifetime membership. I plan to use this every day to help build parts of my brain that I don‚Äôt often use.   It‚Äôs got great cognitive games to help train, relax, improve my brain functions.  Every day is different games. A must have. I am being challenged by brushing up my thinking skills, thanks to Impulse!"
5,smandy1729,I worked in a field where we did brain training daily with our clients. I loved it so much. Impulse using great games to help me achieve getting in a few mins if brain training daily. Highly recommend!!
5,Roses üåπ üåπüåπ,Impulse has helped me to focus and work on areas that improve my ability to concentrate. It has allowed me to get rid of ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù. I feel more alert and have a greater ability to make clear observations.  Roses üåπ üåπüåπ
5,LunaAnn.Kay,"I love this app, and i mostly use it to help with anxiety :). It has alotsss of gaming options that each challenge different parts of the brain, but that are also supppper fun!üòç I would recommend, although theres fees :(. Other then so, its awesome!"
5,Cobalt Dar,I try to play brain games at least 10 minutes everyday to keep my mind sharp. This is by far the most challenging and versatile brain game app I‚Äôve found. Highly recommend.
5,Gail Arae,"Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs working yet because it‚Äôs only been one day. I think Impulse should wait to ask after 10 days of use. But either way, so far it‚Äôs fun and I think I feel my brain stretching."
5,Mama EMB,"Not like other brain training apps at all!! I was pleasantly surprised and impressed!! The challenges are reasonable and not too long or boring, keeps you intrigued and wanting more!!"
4,GC is me :),"Love this so much. Great concept, amazingly helping people become smart. Everything I personally would really want to work on though is behind a paywall. I suggest makings at least one thing for each section free for all the broke nerds out here, but thanks for the app still!"
5,elizoegomez,"The app is like all of the brain games apps you‚Äôve seen in one. They are given in a systematic schedule adhered toward learning and growth. This is important because most app are productivity centered. This app allowed me to choose my intentions, I choose relaxation üòå"
5,reneexx16,"It does have you pay, I won‚Äôt lie, but I personally believe it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve never had a test or quiz, get me so well. And then they have mini games to play to keep your mind sharp! Why wouldn‚Äôt you want that!"
5,12$?;)43;,This was an awesome game for me and my daughter to play. We are improving our memory each day by playing it for 10 minutes each day. Totally recommend for you or your family.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Signbrat04,This gives you a great brain stimulation that allows you to have a quick response in problem solving and math and memory  In all areas has improved my brain that allows me to do my job better and think more clearly
5,@Craycraft_Cory,"I love to play these when I get the midday boring blues. If you‚Äôve got a busy schedule and are looking to relax with stayin away from your typical instagram, Facebook, TikTok, repeat formula this is the perfect game to play because it‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs a guilty pleasure to make you smarter!"
5,yassified ü§û,"This is the best app that has helped me with so much i needed to work on. I recommend 100% in my opinion, it distracts me from things i would rather not have attention on and is fun to play when im bored. This is the best visual learning for me!!"
4,Ishtar Yo,I like this game very much and my only problem is the ads. After each short trainings there‚Äôs an ad to get through but if you buy the game you wouldn‚Äôt have the ads. I would definitely buy it if I had the extra money.
5,Danielll543267,"I love candy sort, completed all 800 levels without adding an extra tube‚Ä¶.except level 657.  Is this level possible to complete without an extra tube?"
5,SamWise2212,"I am recovery from a traumatic brain injury and this helps me strengthen my brain, it helps my memory and I can focus better and even respond quickly to math questions and such. It uses fun games to train your brain and makes it very stress free, it‚Äôs amaze balls üíú"
5,RanchoMike75,"The app has every thing needed to wake your brain up lol. Better then coffee. I play the games and do tests only the daily. Games get harder as you progress. Suffering from post concussion syndrome, the app has help me regain brainpower again."
5,samkeky,These games are fun and challenging. Bonus is you don‚Äôt have to wait till your energy refills and they don‚Äôt take a whole lot of your time either. Plus they help maintain brain function.
5,PBS stan,I really like this app. It challenges me without becoming overwhelming. I need to start using it every day because it‚Äôs not as scary as it might seem at first and I enjoy it
5,Therapist Ninja.,Love the variety and the areas it helps grow in brain functionality. Enjoy some more than others but the ones I need the most work on are tue less enjoyable. Lol. They encourage you and is not discouraging at all.
5,ATcastle34,"The games are fun to play, very beautiful, and challenging. They challenge different areas I want to get better in, like mental math, attention to detail, and ability to sift through irrelevant information to find what‚Äôs important. Recommend!"
5,CaseyLT8765,"It is mind stimulating as well as calming and fun so far. I am really enjoying it. I read the directions to each one without worrying if I will do well. Once I am in and I know what to do, I am calm and focused with fun and curiosity that I do well."
5,L3goEg0,I have been working on this every morning and it has really helped me with memory and focus. I am impressed with how well structured the app is and I really encourage others to try it.
4,sa3so,Great for mental exercise or even satisfying to the most intelligent brains. It should be free though if it was it would have 5 stars but the app lives up to what it would cost to pay and you can play all kinds of different games even if you don‚Äôt.
5,socks123az,I love this game! Each time I play it I feel my brain going into action to try and solve as many problems as I can correct. I love how I can challenge myself with each game working a different part of my brain.
5,RAE all caps,"I love sudoku, crosswords, trivia, palace card game, solitaire, minesweeper, etc.  I might be showing my age... or my intelligence. Anyway, this app feeds that part of my brain that loves showboating how much I know, how fast i am a thinker, and how well i execute under pressure.  Great app for smart people."
5,DiemMi,"Sometimes when it‚Äôs slow at work, on the potty or really bored where I‚Äôm at‚Ä¶. This is a great way to keep me from online shopping and keeping my mind entertained and sharp. Hopefully this will help me remember things better! üòÜ"
5,Prism715,I recently subscribed to Impulse‚Äôs brain workout to help with my memory and sharpen my mind as I am in the process of learning Japanese. There‚Äôs a lot of new words to learn and memorize. Impulse has been helping to test my brain‚Äôs memory which is just what I needed!
5,jojo benzo,It‚Äôs relatively entertaining and seems to have good variety of different types of games. I did the relax and unwind style so my games are probably more enjoyable than the ‚Äútest me‚Äù kind of ones. There are a zillion ads though. But it‚Äôs enjoyable
5,Trissy1986,"I saw this on tik tok and thought I would give it a try.  I really like how quick and fun these little brain quizzes are! Not time consuming, and help just add a little brain work out to my day!"
5,pop rock supporter,This app helps me so much!! I have less anxiety and over think less. This is something that makes me feel 100% better and more confident/ comfortable. I think you should definitely download it
5,hejdihrod,It‚Äôs a real good app that has allowed to spend hours of my time on learning and practicing basic skills. The only downside is you have to buy a subscription for more puzzles and more help.
4,BigBizAnt,"Since I‚Äôve started playing this app, I‚Äôve noticed that my headaches are minimal compared to the usual. Even playing while having a migraine has helped me! It‚Äôs a must try. I‚Äôm playing the unpaid version and the 5 second timer on ads helps keep me interested!"
5,Ariel savannah,The games are engaging and fun and keep you entertained while learning and training your brain. I don‚Äôt like how frequently you have to watch adds but it is what it is. So far no glitches or shutdowns and runs smoothly
5,TreeOfEve,"I‚Äôm always just sitting around looking at my phone screen and I can feel my mind getting dull , this game definitely keeps me entertained and on my toes with problem solving and memory, hand eye coordination and peripheral vision! I love it!"
5,Kick ty boss,"Definitely a good app, I haven‚Äôt bought the full version yet. I‚Äôm still playing around with the free games and so far I love them. I plan to come back and let everyone know when/if I buy the full version."
5,TheHumanCondition,"I definitely didn‚Äôt expect Impulse to be a good as it is! I have a hard time focusing and loose interest easily, but the way the games change and challenge you are surprising!"
5,Ed-rMar,Enjoy this app very much. When will you be adding additional Words Crossword puzzles?  I‚Äôve completed all 1000 and have been waiting for months for the new ones.
5,Karlie333,"I love this game! Every exercise is quick which I love, and what motivated me most is how I compare to others. At the same time I can track my progress by watching. I want to be sharp for my age and continue to as I age!"
5,eco-tint.com,"When you‚Äôre sitting idle just flipping through social media or reading something completely arbitrarily stupid, at least you can use your brain!"
5,CamJ017,"This app has a variety of puzzles and games along with tests to know about your knowledge and yourself. Not only does this app improve my intelligence, but it also helps me understand what I am and capable of."
5,Motha Byrd,"This is awesome ! He helps me focus , keep calm , and strengthen my mind ! Each day I get better with myself . This is wonderful for people who have adhd . Self control is a thing and this very encouraging. It‚Äôs a way for me to release all that energy ."
5,Kaitiebuggg,"I really like this app. I‚Äôm always looking for some stimulating brain activities, anything to improve my mental health, and this is just right.  The tasks are just the right level of difficulty to be helpful and fun. The games are pretty cool too:)"
5,Rosimom2406,All the rage this game should be it's got functionality n absolutely everything that u do in normal life but hate it bc u just don't get it. Get this app then it's just makes sense. Then u can keep up w the rugrats u created ain't that fun.
5,towerdog508,If your looking for something to take up time download this App it‚Äôs not only a game but keeps your mind sharp and makes you feel good ‚Ä¶wish it didn‚Äôt cost money #lovethisapp
5,exotic ely,The challenges are simple but not simple if you will you have to be sharp and remain like that until completed challenges further more your due
5,MGGF29,I‚Äôve used it 2 times now and it helps me relax my mind after work. After having a brain injury and going through cognitive therapy for months. This is the closest thing to it to keep my mind trained.
1,Bruha84,Played this for a while then stopped. When I recently started playing it again it was overwhelmed with ads after every single level or game. It used to give info on say an ADHD report for free but now I have to pay for everything. I guess greed got the best of this company. Seemed like they used to like helping people figure out their learning disorders. Now it‚Äôs all about money. No thanks. Deleted.
4,corolacademystudent,I don‚Äôt get why I have to pay to see what‚Äôs wrong with me‚Ä¶ this app is supposed to help me but it‚Äôs holding things back from me and that‚Äôs not helping. I want to get better but I‚Äôm still a kid who doesn‚Äôt have a job and I can‚Äôt pay for any of it.
5,D$strive4greatness,Great game to just exercise your brain and also refresh your thinking and mental skills. Also good for when you‚Äôre just bored at home and want to also be productive at the same time lol
5,S Turner,The games are designed to get you thinking but are actually fun. Enjoy the daily program and the dashboard which lets you see how you progress and where you rank amongst your peers.
5,Mama JLinn,"I am loving Impulse! Its not only helping me, but it‚Äôs also fun. I have really not came across anything I dislike, it‚Äôs all so much fun!! I will continue using this app for as long as I can. If you‚Äôre on the fence about it, come on and join me!"
5,jeffboyrdeee,I decided to try it out in order to improve my memory and decrease my stress and anxiety. So far it‚Äôs been helping. I might just purchase the lifetime one so I may improve my brain overall.
5,fgjjjgfghgvv,"Loving this app Great way to spend my time feeling like I‚Äôm bettering myself! It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs interesting, it‚Äôs simple and great explanations of what I‚Äôm doing and what it will help me do better! The price was very affordable, and so much to do on it! And No glitches so far!"
5,Amby810,This app has puzzles to train your brain and tests to learn about your brain. The puzzles and games are super fun and addictive I didn‚Äôt want to stop playing and it was really interesting to learn more about how my brain works!
5,AJbert585,Impulse has so many well made and easy to use brain games and all in one place. The design of the app is well made any thorough. Can't say enough praises about it‚ú®
5,ABoldenPhotography,I downloaded this app and deleted social media and this has been the most fun I‚Äôve had in a while! Being able to challenge my mind has helped and I‚Äôm only on day 3!
5,Latino_Ice,I enjoy the format of the games. The scheduling and tracking features are great. The ranking after every effort is a very important feature. Special thanks to the team for this excellent product.
3,KAM.01,"This game used to be super fun, then over time they‚Äôve added adds to where you‚Äôre waiting longer just for them to pass then the actual time your playing the games. I don‚Äôt want to sit for 45 seconds between each game to watch an add. Sadly I‚Äôll be deleting this app."
5,Gina Madison,The games are great but there seems to be a lag and it causes the app to think that I‚Äôve gotten the answer wrong when I really was just faster than the app.
4,bednigo,I love it and think it is a great way to use my brain creativity. The one problem is that there are so many adds. You can pay for no adds but if you don‚Äôt want to you‚Äôre just gonna have to deal with them.
5,muse11,These games and tasks really made me aware that I need to listen intently to find details of assignments. They really made me think and I felt a sense of pride when I realized I understood and could perform at the level expected.
5,dishydoesit,Like that I have to actually think when I‚Äôm on my phone  Fun to pass time if nothing else to do
5,Lay lay _2drippy,This is such a great way to help your brain relax and learn at the same time. They know exactly what you need to help your mind nothing is better then learning my brain feels better than what it used to. So get this good
5,Mmmvegas,I have been please with the training exercises and am hopeful that it will help keep my mind sharp as I get older.  Having something measurable is helpful for me to determine where I am. This is produces a measurable score.
5,kindiesandy,Impulse has a variety of ‚Äúgames‚Äù that challenge me different ways. Each time I play I can tell my consentration and memory focus are getting better. And there‚Äôs enough variety to not be boring.
5,Edv0luti0n,"In an age with so much mental vomit circulating around us . This game is like a run through a mental obstacle course that gives me the mental dexterity to finish my work day, week and so on . I like it and I‚Äôm a better person for it ."
5,J hart74,This is helping me gain confidence and get better at the same time I would recommend any survivor with confidence issues to give it a shot and don‚Äôt let set backs be anything more than learning experiences.
1,kprinz11,"If you want to just try this app, don‚Äôt. It offers a free trial for the membership (there is no different types of access, just payment schedules) but the free trial doesn‚Äôt actually get you the access. It limits you on everything and says you need to subscribe to continue. Its only goal is just to hope you forget to cancel, not actually to try to convert people into customers after experiencing their product."
5,BAM151515,Impulse is a great way to challenge yourself with many games. So far I‚Äôve enjoyed all of them. Im always excited to see what challenges are next to continue working on skills for me.
5,XtremeSheri,This is a great app with many different variations and activities. I‚Äôm happy so far and I recommend it and it‚Äôs not mindless activity on a phone. Enjoy I paid for the lifetime because it made the most senseü§ó
5,FallenCaveGoblin,"Good games, smooth sound design, engaging. Starts off a bit too easy but you aren‚Äôt limited by purchases. It still will give you results and info without purchase"
5,IndySparky,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure that it‚Äôs improving my cognitive abilities (but it can‚Äôt hurt). But it‚Äôs a fun collection of quick games that can keep you entertained. Lots of these games have similar counterparts in standalone apps, but it is nice to have them all collected in one app."
5,benitoned,I like how it pops up to remind you to take the tests. Often it‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm ready to relax and sometimes after several drinks. Humbling to see how debilitating a few drinks can actually be
5,Brinnlit,It‚Äôs like my ‚Äúget started‚Äù with my day. I notice better cognitive function similar to coffee in its stimulation when I play these types of games when added to my morning routine
5,ShadowPhx,"I treat this game like I‚Äôm working out my mind . Once you think of it in this way it will pay off even more and make it fun. I‚Äôm glad I found this app, one of the best apps out there for productivity and mental practice."
5,Soothing Sandy,"I love to keep sharp and this program definitely helps me enjoy the concentration. Nothing like having to work on a computer, doing on my phone and it‚Äôs enjoyable."
5,Mo3C,The test are pretty self explanatory. Not to difficult in beginning but hopefully it will once i start playing more frequently. Other than great training to keep the mind sharp.
5,Mingolishes,"So far its challenging and keeps my mind working on problem solving. It may not always be as fun since it does get you thinking hard on some games, but its part of the challenge."
5,56036 last samurai,"As I get older I realize that my memory is not what it used to be. Impulse helps me to work on my memory with fun and challenging games. Give it a try, at the very least you‚Äôll have some fun and learn a thing or two."
5,Morg of Salts,"I love the app; it‚Äôs perfect for breaks throughout the day, chock full of fun brain games and it lets you try many of the features before a subscription is require. So far, a 5 star app, very well done."
5,App for Everyone!,This app is awesome you get to exercise your brain and get conclusions of what kind of person you may be along with finding out your in score etc. Everyone needs to try this out!!!
5,Wizzboy16,These activities keep my brain on point. During a free couple of minutes I work on these activities and get a true thrill challenging my brain.   Every should challenge their brain using apps like these.
5,G‚Äôma Rae,I am elderly and want to keep a functioning brain.  This app is definitely making me think.  I am enjoying it very much and look forward to the progress I hope to make.
5,Liz Jay,I‚Äôm always looking for something like this to do while I‚Äôm bored or waiting around for someone. I really like the games but the puzzles and tests are really interesting too! Definitely get it!
5,th1016,This is a nice break from typical social media.  It challenges my mental focus and allows me to see my own personal skill level and where I need to improve my game.  It actually works the brain just like a bicep burn with a 12lb weight!
5,mhtfdfggfccvvc,"I have only been using this app for two days,  but so far it‚Äôs really helping me slow down and pay attention to detail in something I may be doing."
5,Olivia margret,"Ofc it asks u to join a subscription at first in support of the creators, but you can opt out. The games are cute and keep the brain busy from matching ghosts, and so far my favorite light sequence that has familiar backgrounds <3  not many ads either"
5,Brae S. 123,"I've noticed significant improvements in my retention and recall abilities, which have positively impacted my grades and overall academic performance. The app's features and exercises are tailored to promote cognitive growth, making it a valuable tool for students like me."
5,Fnaf_Finatic,"Out of all the health apps I‚Äôve tried, this is definitely number 1. It helps you with all sorts of things while still including games! Most games are fun and can even be addicting at times!"
5,BD221456,Every body could benefit immensely from daily brain training and these games are fun and help improve your cognitive skills life‚Äôs a marathon never stop and exercising your brain if you don‚Äôt use you lose it
5,Light_codex,"I have a history of Alzheimer‚Äôs in my family, so I was looking for a simple way to integrate brain training into my daily tasks. Impulse is by far the simplest way to smoothly keep up the routine without being overwhelmed."
5,BlossV,I don‚Äôt ever write reviews and it‚Äôs really rare I even use an app besides social media frequently. This has me hooked and I can feel the improvement it boosts me mentally. I‚Äôll probably subscribe to premium soon.
5,schwinningxoxo,"Fun games make it feel like you‚Äôre playing, instead of training. Gives you lots of information on how your brain works. As someone who is constantly stimulated, this works wonders."
5,lou lou lou125098765,All other apps related to this one have many annoying issues that this app does not have. It‚Äôs fun and enjoyable and customizable to your needs. 5/5 all the way
1,keldel22,"I‚Äôve been communicating with Impulse support for over a month with no tangible results. I have to follow up with them once a week. No one will respond. I‚Äôve asked for my money back because the app has removed my entire history and will not redeem a purchase.   While their product is great, I will no longer use this app. There are plenty of over apps out there that do the same thing. Buy them instead."
5,alivriwha,"Ever since I started using this I could remember things more thoroughly!  I found this app through a tik tok advertisement thinking it would be false, however I didn‚Äôt get fooled like the rest!  Seriously, get this app."
5,Bucket3337,I have enormous amount of enjoyment playing the games on this app.  Didn‚Äôt know you.l could find so much enjoyment and entertainment while improving your mind at the same time.  I highly recommend this app!
5,C_72,I like doing these because in just a few minutes of game play per day I‚Äôm exercising my brain in a calm and stress free way. I don‚Äôt mind the ads as that interruption allows me to have access for free.
5,Miss Troll,"I like this game, if I had extra money I would pay for the premium but the free version is good enough for me right now! It has a lot less ads than other games which is great! Love the exercises too!"
5,CAMS134,With a wide variety of games from easy and distracting to challenging. I find I‚Äôm spending much less time on the socials and have enjoyed trying to keep a streak going.
5,AshleyBehrendt,"If you‚Äôre going to play games throughout the day, you might as well exercise your brain. This app is a good way to take a break from the other stressors in life and really maintains your attention."
5,The Conquest,I like it because it challenges you to use your brain more than you usually would do. Giving you a good sense of what you want to improve on and stay focused and sharp.
4,CabooseConsumer,It‚Äôs a fun way to exercise your brain. Games and activities are tailored to the areas of your brain YOU want to improve. The only thing I‚Äôd change is maybe give a week long trial or maybe two weeks rather than just 3 days.
5,Ghfbjgvjdcnhxvhscvj,"Super engaging, I‚Äôd imagine that this app would definitely will help with cognition if you used it religiously. Games are creative and sometimes even addictive. Beats luminosity and other brain training apps. Broad spectrum of exercises too. Good job guys."
5,liv robitzsch,"I‚Äôve just downloaded this app and really love it! You do have to pay for a premium subscription for an upgraded experience, but the free version with ads works well for me. Lots of ads though, be prepared!"
5,kid_ridiculous,"After watching my wife and our kids jumping up and down trying to beat the timer, i had to join them in the fun.   It keeps you sharp and concise.   Would recommend."
5,Klaudiavill,"Helps me give my brain a little challenge every day. I have long COVID and have been suffering from memory loss, these games have helped me keep my brain active and I do see a small difference in my memory"
5,BadGalMaraj,"I am not much of a gamer in any fashion, but always love small little challenges like this and I find my every brain ‚Äúworkouts‚Äù to energize me in a way I‚Äôve never really experienced before! I love it so much."
5,Anne Jp,This app is so helpful when you fall into boredom somewhere but still want to be alert. I feel like I‚Äôm exercising my brain every time I go through one of the challenges which are like games.
5,destin314,"Great games for the mind not only does it track your progress for you but you can track it yourself, where ever you want to improve it has games for you."
5,üÖ¢üÖóüÖîüÖ°üÖòüÖìüÖêüÖù,"Before bed when I want to scroll I play some games. My mental math has become faster, my problem solving skills has changed positively. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much but I received a lot of positive changes."
5,jnevy04,Have been playing these games for only a few days and I already noticed the positive effects at work and when I‚Äôm doing a project
5,JD1223117,"Even on the free version, the games are varied, easy to understand, and pretty fun. The seven-day activity is easy to complete & I at least feel overall smarter üòÇ ads are present but not frustratingly common. Highly recommend!"
3,sleezy operators,Games lose their interest when you get to a relatively low bar for a max score.  Certain games scoring is way off from others‚Ä¶  Premium is nowhere near worth it as there just isn‚Äôt enough content.  I‚Äôve finished almost everything and maxed scores out within a few days‚Ä¶.
5,rokurokudokugirl,"So many fun games that are free to play. All are unique and easy to learn. I started playing these games to help my social media addiction and now I‚Äôm addicted to this app! I‚Äôm not disappointed, considering on buying to skip the ads"
5,Ophelia 345,"I just started using this app, so far it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for: fun, challenging, quickly finish. Only one complaint is the free version has a ton of ads. We‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs worth buying. Time will tell..."
5,Ground To Crown Tree Care,I‚Äôm really enjoying this app! I find it‚Äôs a great way to spend some idle time instead of mindlessly scrolling random content that doesn‚Äôt really have any point to it. Thanks!
5,TheTrueCritic,"Lots of mentally engaging challenges with a wide variety through the daily ‚Äútraining‚Äù module. The ‚Äúgames‚Äù section a blast and helps me unwind and get out of my own head. Graphics are clean, UI is easy to navigate, and the tests are a lot of fun and relatively insightful!"
5,...cup,So far so good. The variety of activities/challenges is great and the testing to learn more about you and your makeup has helped me understand choices I‚Äôve made. Looking forward to growing with the app.
5,kthphoto,"Really enjoy all the brain training games and insight the app gives you regarding their benefit, & how you compare to other ppl playing üëåüíØ Do it every day and i really feel my skills hav improved. 5-stars! üíú"
5,alainfetau,"It really doesn‚Äôt feel I like brain training‚Ä¶ feels like a bunch of fun games! Anytime I have a few minutes, I whip out my phone then complete a challenge‚Äî and I‚Äôm feeling sharper everyday!"
5,genermation x,As I am in the Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia field.  I believe strongly that with the development of new medications that clear plaques and tangles it is important to work and exercise your brain daily.  This app is a great starting place!!!  Thank you!
5,Lynam Lookout,"I really liked this one. I do two other brain training games every day, and I enjoy them; but with this one, I could sorta feel different parts of my brain like firing!  Enjoyed this one a lot!"
5,Geedo92,"Please check out this app if you want to improve you brain functionality. The first day I tried this app, I was impressed!! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend no other app. Enjoy!!!"
5,K.C.J. 33824,"I‚Äôve been playing a couple days, and so far it‚Äôs pretty good. I initially didn‚Äôt intend to pay anything, but they offered a 92% discount on the annual subscription, so I just bought it. Hopefully it‚Äôs worth it."
5,Elle2006,The approach to diagnosis your mental capabilities are user friendly and effective.  I appreciate that the app tracks progress and motivates you to continue to engage. The Brain is a muscle the more we use it the stronger it becomes.
5,Blackdiamonds56,"This has a great user interface and it‚Äôs really fun to use. Also, I can see the benefits of this after only using it for a few days. Feels like a healthy alternative to doomscrolling."
5,0mlett,"Impulse has improved my IQ score by 5 points in just one month! It has so many fun brain power games, and quizzes to test your ability, but I don't know cuz this is coming from an eleven year old."
5,kdfoxbrkxhsbxidvmxo,"Impulse is so much fun! Not only are the trainings fun, but the little mini games and tests are unique too! It asks and aids you in the topics and sections of your life you‚Äôd like to fix or improve. Honestly amazing and I‚Äôm so glad instagram ads pushed this out to me."
4,EnpresssJai,It‚Äôs cool just wish the ads where shorter even though I have the option to pay for no ads. However I don‚Äôt think the game is a game worth spending money on in today‚Äôs economy. Thanks for the early morning brain exercise however.
5,GeeGee4578,I have found that the quizzes and tests and the information afterwards has been very helpful insight to understanding me and my brain or way of thinking and just some characteristics that I have. Awesome job with this app!!
5,Alyssa b j c,It is so fun it helps your  brain learn I would really recommend to download for your kids they should be for 5 and up years old
5,Big T1111,"Just started playing, but I can already tell this is what I was looking for from other apps and couldn‚Äôt find. Has a good array of things to keep the ol‚Äô brain sharp while having fun."
5,Andrew202020,"The variety of games/puzzles is wide and they keep you engaged.  I just started using the app 2 days ago, but I can already see how this app does help train the brain. The exercises are created well."
5,DavinaMH,"I am only 56 years young and sometimes forget things, but by utilizing this app‚Ä¶it helps me to improve my memory. And the great thing is that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are 8 or 88- it‚Äôs helpful and FUN for all ages."
5,Jenn_0070,"It‚Äôs my second day with impulse and I‚Äôm already a fan, I told my friends about it and they‚Äôve also downloaded, looking forward to all the daily exercises my brain will be doing!"
5,bw72472,Nothing like the others. It really gets your brain going. Some others I‚Äôve tried were too easy or just not what they claim to be. This one tops them all tho. You gotta try it.
4,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅü•∞üòçüòã,I love it a lot it helps but I don‚Äôt want to pay because I won‚Äôt use the app a lot when I took the ADHD test it asked me to pay to see my result and I think it‚Äôs kind of harsh because it may be important but I have to waste money to see what‚Äôs wrong with me.
4,Toya Fan <3,"I‚Äôm not gonna waste real money on a video game, even this one! When I downloaded it, I thought it would be free and enjoyable!  But it‚Äôs not all free, most of the games that I want cost money and the games I hate are free! I‚Äôm keeping it for reasons  (And I really wish you could see your IQ and other test results, but nope!) Please try to fix it!!! And the adds, every single corner are some type of stupid adds! Anyway, God bless, and hope you have a great day! More to come if my opinion changes or I have more ideas!!!!!!!! Byyeeeeee!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,pau g river,Im a college student who wanted to get better with thinking overall. I have had this app for a couple days and I feel challenged every time I play this app.
5,Tinanazee,"This game helps me to improve my brain health, they say. I can see how. I want to continue practicing so that I can score very high in it. I hope I can come back to this review to update the review of my newest scores. Now I score at 900. Thank God."
5,12344555777789000???,Why like impulse is because there is barely any adds and in beginning you can choose what you want to work on and how you want your brain to be teased AND you can set goals for yourself.
5,Lawniee,This is only my second day using this app but I already love it. It is so fun to learn about your brain and what you need to work on and it‚Äôs also a good healthy way to spend your spare time on your phone.
5,shamrookali,The app has simple exercises to ease you into the program. You‚Äôll face different sections and play different levels of difficulty. Follow the mentality of improving by 1% and this could be a useful venture. Mastery and expertise can be learned.
5,RHWilliams,"I‚Äôve only played Impulse a few saysb but I really like it! The games are fun and provide a variety of activities that make me focus and think. However, they‚Äôre all very fun. I will definitely keep playing!"
5,k.ella,Its worth getting the app. Its fun and it gets your brain working. I like how it is customed to what you want to focus on. And again the games are so much fun but at the same time it does help you achieve what you want to focus on.
5,cbkffhikkjfdt,I enjoy games like Sudoku and puzzles. I like that this app allows me to improve my cognitive functions but also keeps it fresh. There‚Äôs no burn out from playing the same games over and over.
4,sj lamb,Activities are engaging and fun and the app explains how each of them work to help you improve yourself in a meaningful way rather than tossing a bunch of games and tests up for you to play. They treat the why's like they're as important as the how's. Which is good because they are.
5,Rachelluv,It‚Äôs fun. It really doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre training your brain. You‚Äôre just like little puzzles and math and it really helps with your memory and everything. I love it.
5,Ravatotem,"Yeah, it‚Äôs just a good idea to get this on your phone. It‚Äôs not just a great time, but the challenges are fun and you learn a little more about yourself every time. Just saying, I don‚Äôt leave many reviews. This is a gem."
5,Sue Claus,"Great brain exercises to get my day started. Being retired, I sometimes get into a ‚Äúzone‚Äù and do not feel like I‚Äôm giving my brain enough healthy exercise.  I‚Äôm glad I found Impulse. It‚Äôs been a fun way to exercise my brain."
5,Cocklina,This is such a new and interesting way to train your brain. You hardly realize by playing the games that you‚Äôre training your brain tone younger than it really is.
5,MirandaMHay,This app is great! Helps keep me on my A game and has helped improve my work performance being able to be more vigilant and has built stronger problem solving strategies. Highly recommend this app
2,Lolapants,"I have a paid sub and have been waiting for updates to the games for months. I see people who have made the same remark back in March, and we‚Äôre told that more games would be released soon. That was 5 months ago. I just keep playing the same games over and over and honestly - THAT isn‚Äôt worth the price."
1,Realdeal*,"I saw an Impulse ad/ invitation on Instagram to take a personality test. When I looked for more info, I realized I needed to sign up for the free trial in order to take the test. So I signed up for the free trial and took their test, answering 72 questions. Only THEN was I informed I would need to pay for an upgraded subscription (??) just to see my test results. What a scam. Why not tell me that before? Because you want free user data, hm? This app has a real slimy vibe."
5,ReadMe12,"I am a younger participant in this app, and I‚Äôve only had this app for 2 days, but it has been very helpful. All the quizzes are so fun, and I can‚Äôt wait to see the improvement in my brain from the really fun games and puzzles!"
5,PaperGirlAC,When games still feel fun while you are mentally challenging yourself- that‚Äôs a perfect combo. Easy to get into but you will get challenged. Really enjoy the variety of games as well.
5,Rafamom,"It seems the creators of this game had someone like me in mind, starting to forget things and stuff like. This exercises have kept my mind sharp and on the go. Kudos for creating such and amazing app."
5,Thebeststephanieperiod,"Amazing tool to use when have free time, it helps keep my mind sharp and to keep me from scrolling. I have learned about myself just in the first week I cannot wait to finish taking all of of tests.."
1,7373644889425478,"This app tries to take advantage of people with impulse control disorder. Everyone scores high on their simple IQ test, and their ADHD assessment is an absolute waste of time. It could only be considered fun if you like winning simple games to feel better about yourself. Be careful. The 3 day free trial requires a 24 hour notice of cancellation before they bill you, thereby becoming only a two day trial. This was created by a grifter who likes to prey on people seeking mental strengthening exercises."
5,Koolaid2014,Only two days in but I have very much enjoyed the short but challenging games and puzzles. I also enjoy the tests and learning more about the way I process information!
2,LelaineDoesGhosts,"The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of one is because the app itself is very enjoyable, but the ads break the immersion. You already have a premium membership guys, you don‚Äôt need to also force people to pay to remove your ads. Or at least don‚Äôt make them after every single level of a game?"
5,st.clair12/4,"Honestly love this app. I‚Äôve had it for 3 days now and it really helps take my mind off stressful things and makes sure I‚Äôm not being completely mindless. And since it‚Äôs summer, I try not to get dumber so this helps"
5,Old Betts,This app is a great way to challenge the mind and stay sharp. I‚Äôm in my 50s and worried about cognitive decline. The games in this app keep me on my toes so my mind stays sharp and focused. It also helps me deal with my anxiety. The fact that it‚Äôs fun is a bonus!
5,Santi_cali17,I wish we had apps like this growing up through school and it helps you lean more into extra curricular activities outside of school and helps you focus and helps me boost my dopamine levels and a release of stress
5,Tresela Lee,"Absolutely love this app! Reminds me of playing Brain Age only better with a lot of different and fun games to help with memory, visuals, thinking fast, accuracy, and much much more! Sharpen them skills, you‚Äôll be surprised."
5,chicaflamenca,"Love this for a little mental break from work, a quick few minutes helps me focus in other ways, so when I do a game or two I feel more capable of finishing work with more focus."
4,Thatonegirl6239,"Wish there was a better free version, but this might be something I decide on purchasing later. On day 2 so we will see if it is worth it. Only thing I wish is a longer free trial so I can really experience all of what the app has to offer"
5,cing0,This is an intuitive app for stimulating my brain. The quiz starts easy and seem to adjust to challenge my brain further. I can certainly do this for brain health over than trolling social media.
5,nycdude416,"Even though I found this app through an ad, I‚Äôve been very happy with it so far. Good variety, a quality build, and it feels like you get actual value from it."
5,JesusJen,I love this app. The games are fun and really make you think. The ads are annoying but still it's worth it. I also like how it says how much better you performed than your peers after playing a game. It's cool!
5,Ashes falling,"This app was FLAWLESS and really helped w memory, that is until one day it all changed and this app that I once used ad free suddenly became INUNDATED w ads at literally EVERY turn. And the thing that gets me is that I have a paid for version!"
4,JDrive_03,"I enjoy a lot of the exercises even though they can be really easy at first, but once you go to higher levels they are challenging. It‚Äôs nice to give my brain a lot of practice with different puzzles and memory exercises."
5,Lori Eddy,Since playing my memory for day to day has improved greatly. It‚Äôs really helped with the frustration of looking for keys pens other issues with short term memory loss
5,StaceyStarüí´,Great way to keep your mind busy but not to think too much if that makes sense. When your trying to stay busy and not think but think about what your doing it‚Äôs a great way to do so.
5,Cristy.Rod,This app allows you to have fun while stimulating your brain. Impulse also brings out my competitive side. At the end of each game it lets you know where you landed compared to your peers.
4,tomboates,I love the app and would love to use it more but I lost my lifetime access when I had to make my secondary purchase account a separate family member. I emailed the support address on the website but never heard back. Can someone help me resolve the issue?
5,Augrad02,I found this is a great way to start my day instead of  just jumping into work email   I feel like gets my brain going and I think better throughout the day
5,bearbqd,I‚Äôve tried a lot of brain game apps in the past and this is by far the best one I have ever seen. It is all encompassing for every type of training you could think of and helps you set goals to boot. I love it.
5,lestymarie2015,"I‚Äôve been looking for a brain training app for MONTHS, and couldn‚Äôt find a decent one then I saw an ad for this one on Facebook and so far it‚Äôs been amazing! Showing me what I can improve on keeping my brain stimulated!!"
5,LdeAnn36,I don‚Äôt have a good memory of previous events at all. I remember certain things but not everything.  I feel like this app could really help me get ahold of my confusions and memory loss. Providing great strengthened memory muscle.
5,alanna janes,I would actually consider paying for it but that‚Äôs just a little too expensive for my taste because I tend to get bored of stuff like that. But I have fun so who knows! Maybe I‚Äôll find it super worth it but
1,Twixxy Poo,"Every time I see an Ad for this I stop and download it because I want to play the games. The word free is very misleading because it‚Äôs not free, you have to subscribe. I just wish they‚Äôd make it known FIRST that you have to subscribe. But its probably better I just remember that it‚Äôs misleading each time instead of redownloading it and getting to the page where you have to pick your subscription type üòï"
5,frackiejost,This app is helping me get my attention span back after deleting social media! It‚Äôs been great to see improvements on the app and in my life. Highly recommend if you like personality tests and learning your strengths and weaknesses.
5,9a,Crazy fun and a boost to my confidence. I don‚Äôt even notice the amount of work I‚Äôm doing on the daily workouts but find I feel more awake and alert after. Unlocking achievements is addictive.
5,Juliet Hickey,"I work in the medical field, for a cardiology office. I‚Äôve been trying to improve my memory skills and problem solving. I love the memory games and it‚Äôs also motivating me to practice while I am home and in the office. Helps a lot!"
5,lovesgizmo,"I‚Äôve been using this when I get the chance and it‚Äôs been a real help with stress, I love the games and daily workouts. I do wish you did have to pay for some things but all in all it‚Äôs a good app."
1,MECNov,"This app charges for every thing it offers. Separate charges for reports, etc. when downloading the app, if you refuse to select a payment plan- it will not close out to the initial landing page, it brings you into the app as if you selected a subscription, and then there is no way to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù it. Deleted the app right away and hope I don‚Äôt get charged.  If you want these tests- they‚Äôre available online for free."
5,Mangi Original,I really love this app because it engages my brain in ways I never thought possible. This is an easy and fun way to exercise my brain without having the strain of having to read boring complicated books.
5,Llllliikjutdj,It‚Äôs great that we can have an app that give us the opportunity to keep our brain abilities updated. Our brains are the most important part of our daily lives function.
5,Song365,"Really having fun and some challenges while working out my brain. I have a brain injury so anything I can do to help keep my functions and maybe be better, helps."
5,Tobeisthebestlol,Cheap as it is a yearly subscription. Really easy to navigate and has a bunch of challenges that are fun to play. Would recommend if your trying to become more intelligent and looking for something fun to play.
5,ella far,i have really bad memory and stuff and the games on impulse have a perfectly personal games of what i want and u get to customize how u want it. It also helps me have something to do when i‚Äôm board
5,Theresa Engel,My memory has been pretty bad lately. I wanted ways to ‚Äúexercise‚Äù it. These challenges are fun and it kind of relieves stress in the process. I also like the option to pay once and that‚Äôs it.
5,Ice924,"Not to sound like everybody else but, This is one of the better brain training apps. i dont agree with the 6.99 a week. But i guess its worth it if your gonna use it daily. It helps you start your day off focused"
5,YourOleSon,This is actually really fun! I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy it this much. Although I don‚Äôt like all the ads they put that‚Äôs after every single game that gets really annoying but other than that I love it!!
5,hay hay jayjay,I downloaded this app to see my own and didn‚Äôt find but that‚Äôs fine once I started playing the games it was really fun and easy for me to keep up .
5,MissTache14,I‚Äôve only been using Impulse for a few days but I‚Äôm really enjoying the concept. The games are quick and can hold my attention. I hope to see some increase in focus with continued practice.
5,Chihua42,"I‚Äôve only just started this app. So far I really enjoy the games. How much it will help me with my ADHD, I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm looking forward to my progress. I will write another review after a while.                                   Lita"
1,Harry Simp,"When I first purchased this app around September of this year I purchased a subscription of around 15 per year. Since then they have charged me about 90 dollars without my permission and without an option to cancel. At least once or twice a month they will charge me 30 dollars and when I attempted to contact them and see what the issue is, they did not respond. This app is a scam."
5,Nolu42,I like impulse because it‚Äôs challenging and makes your brain work. As well as this it lets you have test which are fun too and you get to compete against others in a way.
5,Empress PMG,Has great exercises to help improve your brains capabilities. I like how you are able to see how well you are doing and how smart you already are. Great for people that want to better their brain‚Äôs abilities.
5,Inspiringlittledetails,This app is a great way to keep your brain active and challenged! I was kind of shocked to see all the different types of tests and have really enjoyed them all so far! Highly recommended!!
1,DevilishCrowe,"Lame, offers a free trial for a total of 3 days, as if that‚Äôs enough time to decide if it‚Äôs working or not, then they lock all the results behind the paywall so don‚Äôt expect to actually learn anything or improve during the trial, more of a look around really. All in all, seems to me like a gotcha tactic to grab quick bucks for some cheap internet quizzes and games you could probably play in a flash browser for free. Big pass‚Ä¶."
4,Katerina‚Äôs message,"I love how it gets me flowing my brain and using all different things that come in handy in life. The sad thing about this is it cost money. To do it nonstop and do all this fun activities. Except I don‚Äôt like spending money on apps other than that, this is a great."
5,SirenEmber,This is so helpful and the fact it reminds me by sending me a notification is top tier. The training sessions are quick which gives me no excuse to get them done.
5,Healthier and Happier!,I have only used this app for two days and I already love it I wish I had enough money for premium so I didn‚Äôt get any ads but one of the best apps I have ever used. Ps it tells you how to skip ads love it
5,Pe@shot247,"I‚Äôve found the game to be extremely fun, and I‚Äôve seen improvement in my mood. So far I‚Äôve been riding on the free trial, but I do plan on buying the full version eventually. Definitely a worthy purchase."

5,vforce_420,"This app is awesome! It has awesome features, Tests to keep you sharp and not let your skills slip. Lots of puzzles and diff challenges to keep you smart and to teach you things you might not have known. Download it ASAP!!!"
5,jp Roblox is number one,"I am a kid and I have some anxiety that I have to deal with and it makes my day quite hard to get through but with this game I am able to have fun, and distract my anxiety thanks to this amazing game"
5,Stacyr520,"I have never been a game player. However, I had really enjoyed wordle and when this was suggested I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. I have really enjoyed the games so far and the tests seem very informative."
5,A. Wise Leaf,I enjoy playing first thing in the morning to challenge my brain and prepare for the day. And play the more relaxing games just before bed. All in all it‚Äôs the perfect way to start and finish my day!!
5,hfhhfyrgh,It‚Äôs a fun game that helps me calm by brain and I‚Äôm obsessed with the daily challenges they are just so much fun and it‚Äôs not only to train your brain your having fun too and there is only a little amount of ads I approveüëç.
5,232323232323232444445444454,i have only been using this app no for two days and I can already see . Difference only 3 games a day will make your mind shar share an answer do awa away me of the world around you
3,Ohshat,Why am I paying for a game app and getting occasional long ads for another game that is advertised as a game with no ads which is ironically what I thought I was getting with this app?   I would give the games 4-5 stars. I‚Äôm giving the long ads boosting a game that reportedly has no ads 0 stars.
5,kyewhite5,"So far I‚Äôm enjoying the app and the way it‚Äôs making me think and test my brain. I‚Äôve only been using the app for 2 days, so we‚Äôll see how it goes further down the line."
5,urmom‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢,I love this game so much! It‚Äôs helped so much already I feel accomplished. One thing is I wish I could add more time to my training but it doesn‚Äôt give me the option after I selected in the past.
5,Jaristi1,I just follow the training and having a good time playing the training games. They offered the right amount of challenge and looks well thought.
5,PuppyChowcoxzp,When I downloaded it I didn‚Äôt know what to do and honestly thought I would delete and didn‚Äôt and now have it forever
5,Krish_Miami,Highly recommend for adults especially those that would to function at heightened cognitive levels for work purposes
5,Ferncoll,I am a big phone game person so it‚Äôs nice to have an option that‚Äôs actually helping my brain while I either get ready for the day or wind down at night
5,Tlingit Girl,"I have been searching for ways to exercise and keep all cognitive skills sharp. Pulse does all of it and it‚Äôs fun. Strategy, Memory, and quick thinking. I really enjoy all the challenges and lessons."
5,Plaque smaker,Entertaining way to train your brain! I used to play candy crush to help me relax but now that I found impulse I find it is a way to relax while actually giving my brain a workout.
1,Polinski213,I wanted to test this out before paying I thought the lifetime subscription option would still be there after my my trial you know kinda makes sense but it was not! It doesn‚Äôt make sense to blindly pay for a product that you have no clue how will work. Oh well I guess the free trial is for me and I‚Äôll try a different app. Free trial has been fun so far!  Update they charged me after canceling my free trial! Don‚Äôt download!
5,religh catirina,"I don't use this app religiously, but if I paid for it I probably would. The games are fun and some of the test‚Äôs might be good for you to find things out about yourself."
5,TaylorDaCutieü•Ωü¶ã,"Just downloaded yesterday, can‚Äôt say what it helped with yet because i only been on my 2 day streak lol. it‚Äôs very time consuming & if it‚Äôs anything like it says it is, then time consuming is good"
5,5 star review for coins,I love this app it‚Äôs fun entertaining and I found myself playing this app a lot more than my other puzzle games!! Once he purchased the app sub subscription everything becomes really fun! it‚Äôs worth the $.
5,JustAnneMack,Saw it was 50% off for a lifetime subscription and its shaping up to b a great investment. Love the games! Gets my brain going and i‚Äôm excited to see how my development goes and the new games and challenges it has to offer.
1,appleuser2938,"I saw this on tiktok and signed up for a free three day trial. I canceled my free subscription after two days but they still charged me for a paid subscription. I asked apple for a refund and they refused. This makes me lose respect for anything sold on the apple store,  apple as a company and this app. Apple should remove it from the app store or give people the refund for this scammy app. I am afraid they will steal more of my money but apple won‚Äôt help."
5,deuceit,"Impulse is a app that should be installed by default on every phone device something we scroll social media because of being bored or overwhelmed, well with this app problem solved."
5,Kaitbailey18,This app is so fun but so helpful! I‚Äôm definitely seeing where I need the most growth. They help you while making you feel confident with where you‚Äôre currently at as well. This app is the best!
5,Travis2229,I like howThe results are in a percentile range on my results to the game and my peers results to the game.I definitely want to beat any low test results I have and hopefully I won‚Äôt get better each time.
5,selfcowgirl,"I haven‚Äôt downloaded any type of game as such, so I found myself very interested and loving all the games and features it offers. I just started so will have to update on progress."
5,kimberly ochoa,Download this just searching up ‚Äúadhd games‚Äù and this is perfect. I needed a new app to be on instead of social media apps. But also wanted it to be good and interactive with my brain. This is exactly that.
5,nobody60p,"So this game may have a bunch of adds, but it‚Äôs really fun and it‚Äôs good for you, most of the time I wouldn‚Äôt keep playing a game if I lost for a while, but this one gives the motivation to keep playing"
5,Marebearyum,"I really like this app. It explains the meaning behind each of the games. Some of the games are annoying. I dont mean annoying because i did not perform well, annoying in general. Hasnt stopped me at all :)"
5,Juanette13,The games are really fun you don‚Äôt even realize that you‚Äôre training your brain you‚Äôre just having a good time playing the games. I love the fact that they make you think.
5,"Susie,T",The games are varied enough to keep it interesting and feels like you are challenging your brain in important ways.  I am 67 and highly recommend this for my generation for certain!
2,Sassy McSweetums,"The app is pretty okay, but the novelty wore off before my trial period was up. The subscription didn‚Äôt show up anywhere until after they charged me. I sent them a letter via the support tab and got no response. Only after the charge went through did the subscription appear on my iCloud."
5,#WAFFELS,"This app is so fun. At first, i downloaded it only for the candy sort game, but the other games are so fun too! I like that the games help with brain training. I didnt expect this app to be so fun, but i am so glad i downloaded this app."
5,MizzWatts,I love this game it‚Äôs helping me tremendously I started having issues with memory and within the last 2 weeks of using this app my memory is starting to improve
5,Naya102393,This is an amazing app. It‚Äôs fun AND functional. I love how the levels increase in difficulty and how the daily games switch up. Keeping it exciting.  I‚Äôm a mindset coach and I‚Äôd love to recommend this sooo to my clients as supplementary support
4,annoyed greek,I never play online games or quizzes. this was bought on a fluke and I haven‚Äôt been able to put it down. it pretty much has everything imaginable including personality assessments IQ tests memory games etc etc etc  it‚Äôs awesome worth every penny
5,ghazaliee,This app certainly took my mind off of my anxiety and my stress so far I played 3 games and no ad interpretations and it doesn‚Äôt keep asking for you to pay so far love it
5,Pax Beth,"These games are so much fun, even though I am 60, they have a way of helping me to use my brain in a ‚Äúschool‚Äù way.. The saying ‚Äú if you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it‚Äù is true for the muscle called the brain."
5,Mr Gamer3275,Ok in my opinion Impulse is the greatest brain game in history because you learn interesting thing and also you can see what your own iq is and your personality mine was iq 123 and influencer was my personality I‚Äôm pulse is amazing 5 stars out of 5
5,Patrick Bravo MB,"I don‚Äôt have time to play many games on my phone, but these are not just games! They are engaging fun activities that bring a sense of fulfillment every time I complete each of them! I love Impulse"
5,aassddee,I‚Äôm 75 soon to be 76 years old. This type of interaction is good for us old folks. Give up the tv for a while and help yourself. So far I have done well but as you go the games get more difficult.  BJA
5,Kelrose22,I love it so far I haven‚Äôt had it long and it is so helpful and if you have problems with anxiety and depression it‚Äôll help you out with that as well! I highly recommend you getting this all!
5,theylov_me,"I‚Äôve been obsessed with the little games, the whole experience is so much fun!! At first when I saw this on TikTok I knew i has to try it and I was right. This app is absolutely amazing and helps so much"
4,wth322,"The app offers a variety of puzzles that don‚Äôt take a lot of effort to do but that stimulate ways of thinking that might not be used on a daily basis. It cost money after the three day trial, I think it‚Äôs 7$/week but don‚Äôt quote me."
2,beet yeet,I downloaded this for the ADHD test for fun and it told me I have severe symptoms of ADHD but it it would make me pay to see the report but the thing in I already have the premium subscription. Why the flip would I have to pay even more which is already 6.99 A WEEK to see a report that‚Äôs not even official. Scam app for real.
5,Leah Tenney,Tried this game and I‚Äôm obsessed! The games that  are for free are great and the daily games tell how good you are compared to your peers. Overall this is a great game and again definitely recommend!
4,Aubrey 101,The reason why I put 8/10 is the Impluse app is really fun but some of the stuff like an iq test you have to buy something to se the full report. I hate how you have to buy a lot of things for reports and adds and other stuff. Overall it‚Äôs a really fun app
5,Kentucky KAGE,"Love the app! With a million things to do a day time for improvement is hard to squeeze in at times. Quick, fun games that supercharge the brain is just what the doctor ordered!!"
5,Christopher M. P.,This app is really nice to get your mind off things around you! The only think I don‚Äôt really like is how you have to pay money to get rid of adds but other than that I love the app
3,StethReb,"Regularly shows ads which have no way to close and force you to restart game. I understand supporting the game with advertising but this makes it unusable. Also, the puzzle game which was shown which first drew me to the game isn‚Äôt even available. This is a little frustrating."
5,ian mari,I was working with speed of memory and the app is pretty accurate with where my attention is although I have a sore thumb so need to use other fingers to tap . Otherwise Bingo!
5,Yeshhhhhsir,It‚Äôs a cool game and when playing you can obviously see what your struggling with. It also has many different cool things to see like how much better you are doing than others. It‚Äôs fun too!
5,Mr.gameand watch,"Great games, I‚Äôm a developer I use this app to kick start my brain. The full version would definitely be something I would buy for a one time payment."
4,ROBLOX_LOVERRRR,"I would give this app a five, but I really dislike the fact that there are adverts with sensitive content in the app. I would really like you to see this and fix it, please. It‚Äôs been happening to a lot of apps I dont care about but this app?"
5,BrownieBBYT12,"I think this app is so great because the games are really fun and addicting but yet they train your mind and make you better, where I feel like kitty many games can really complete that goal"
5,chr5tnR,I really enjoy using this app when I have spare time. Kind of annoying that it‚Äôs a weekly subscription but I think I get my money‚Äôs worth from the yearly plan with how much I use this app.
5,Don_Nogueda,Very helpful and very much what I needed to keep my brain sharp in todays day in age where  scrolling is unlimited and losing focus is everlasting. I‚Äôm glad to find something that helps me reel my mind back in and perform at my best on a daily basis.
5,MooseVII,Found that using this app daily turns moderately strenuous challenges into fundamentally easy tasks. Simple 5-10 minutes a day has improved multiple aspects of my reoccurring mental strains.
5,Zello ZTPNGV,I appreciate everything these developers are doing I enjoy the gameplay and the day to day progression I‚Äôm making as a person because of the app Thank you   Worth checking out and investing in
3,RacerDudeeee,"Very cool app with fun games and challenges but I deleted it after an hour. After every single challenge I got an ad‚Ä¶. I get it, you need the revenue for being free and opting to not pay the subscription but holy moly‚Ä¶. Chill on the ads and more people would keep the app and you would in turn make more ad revenue."
5,shanynate14,I like this app because it helps me to concentrate and learn new skills. The games are entertaining and great to play. I recommend it highly. You won‚Äôt regret getting it. It has all the games you love and more.
5,Joe McIncome,"Just a working stiff, idk about if it actually does anything beneficial, but it is a fun little thing to do, and make yourself feel smart, and if it does help, than there‚Äôs that too."
5,KurtNoykos,"I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 weeks. It‚Äôs hard to say a few brain games a day is directly related to memory, sleep & depression; but it‚Äôs not hurting anything! I‚Äôll take the little uptick before the winter months & SAD!"
5,grsx bklm vddwqsxh,This is the type of challenge I was looking for.  You have to think fast and since you are timed it adds that element of pressure that either you stay cool or you lose it!
5,rvrststr,"I‚Äôve been losing my memory and getting forgetful and I just started this program. Not sure if it‚Äôs helping yet but I do enjoy the games, especially since they are supposedly helpful and aren‚Äôt a time waster game"
5,L.A Rock management,Really enjoying It. I‚Äôve only done 4 days and I just completed some work tasks today that had previously had me stumped for 4 months! Did I get smarter?   I love the games to expand my brain and also the IQ tests.
5,Pings78,"Love this app, at 44 I‚Äôve been wanting more than reading to keep my mind sharp and this has been the answer gives me something fun to do and helps with focus and great exercise for the mi d definitely recommend!!"
5,some 11 yo yo,"I really like this app because it‚Äôs not like others, it has multiple categories for the things you want to work on in your brain such as memory, quick math, and sorting!!"
5,?boby?,Great fun. Challenging. I love the levels. Keeps me on my toes.  Kids play these games as they are developing and they become sharp. Adults seem to forget about brain games thus they slowly deteriorate in memory skills. These challenges help restore some of that.
5,shaabrams1975,I enjoy this app it allows me to actually work on problems I haven‚Äôt done in forever and it keeps my mind going. I always say if you don‚Äôt use it you will lose it.
5,(„ÜÜ _ „ÜÜ),"This app is great. The IQ tests are the reason I downloaded the app, and I feel that they are challenging and accurate. The mental exercises are fun and keep my brain sharp. The games are also satisfying to complete. Overall, I love this app and plan on continuing to use it!"
5,Da72685,"I absolutely love this app! But, I‚Äôve been stuck on level 107 in the Candy Sort game for over a week now. I don‚Äôt think he level is meant to be passed! About to delete the app!"
5,Periwinklelly,"Impulse is a great game! It helps me focus and it is also just really fun. There are not many ads, which is nice too. Most of the features can be unlocked without purchasing them. I don‚Äôt have any complaints!"
4,JuJu977,"This app lets you choose how frequently you want to use it and gives quick mini games that help improve certain aspects of your mind. I love how it doesn‚Äôt force you to pay or pester users to log in, 4/5."
5,Brainstorm12.2,To be honest I didn‚Äôt think I was gonna enjoy it as much. Turns out I needed to work out my Brian as much as I work out my body. I was extremely rusty on every day activities. And this really got the ball rolling for me .
5,5784243,I enjoy this app a lot there‚Äôs a lot of creative/fun games to target multiple areas of cognition. Definitely a productive way to pass time!! Just wish there weren‚Äôt ads if you don‚Äôt pay the membership.
5,DBJeffery,My first time to use this technology. I already feel hopeful that I can make significant progress in my thought processes and  quality of life. I look forward to my next session.üëçüèº
3,dyrule,"the initial free 30 day workout of this app is amazing! i loved playing each game every morning. my only problem is that after, this did not restart and i could not go back and do it again without manually pressing each game. while you needed to watch an ad before each anyway(which i agree with as it‚Äôs the free version), you are prompted to do so ‚Äî making a redo of each day tedious when it‚Äôs the same exact system as before.  my only request is to reset the 30 day challenge after it is completed. i don‚Äôt even mind the same games as the previous, as long as it differs each day."
5,Willijopro2687,"I just started using this app I‚Äôve had it before, but I don‚Äôt like it when I mess up so I get mad and delete things. Good thing it‚Äôs still in the cloud."
5,Jeff 98%,Average Game and I keep getting in the 90% tile makes me wonder how slow the majority of people are playing this game because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going faster but whatever it‚Äôs fun
5,gerry rice,Not sure if it‚Äôs worth paying for yet but I did pay for it now I need to use it consistently over a few weeks/months to decide. Will return with answers.
5,Erichüòé1,So far I like this game. I don‚Äôt have the paid subscription but I do feel as though playing the games during my downtime is relaxing while keeping my mind sharp.
5,Margie 2.0,"I really feel like I am using skills that I have ignored even having for a very long time. I didn‚Äôt tap in to my math skills being very important but as the nurse, I know that I use these a lot."
5,The LGPC,I‚Äôm looking into ways to steer clear of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs and these are the kinds of games recommended. Just not something you‚Äôd do normally
5,Spectre23467,It's overall a great experience I wanted to find way to stimulate my brain activity and it very much succeeded in doing so. It's a wonderful app and I very much recommend it for whatever reason.
4,kidnik1970,"Downloaded this game last night. I‚Äôm at that point where I feel not as sharp, so a bit of training is in order. So far I enjoy it, but it‚Äôs only the second night. Hopefully I‚Äôll remember to return and update."
5,Prince X C,I thought that i was always the dumb kid but when i played this game and realized that i beat 99% of my peers it made me a feel of joy and it is improving my response time my attention span and my memory
5,jfuncynfybvufjfyvcgg,This app is not only good for your health but the games are really fun and they are really easy. Then it will match how quick you are with things so it‚Äôs the perfect level of difficulty.
1,12345dog guy,"First you have to answer a bunch of questions just to get into the game and the game forces you to get the notifications even though you don‚Äôt want them and then the game makes you have to pay or else you can just play for just THREE DAYS! Which is not fair especially to the people who only have enough money to have a house, food, one phone, and one car."
5,Kinky bob 83,"So far Impulse has been a great little brain training tool. It‚Äôs fast moving, holds my interest and definitely gives me a feeling of moving forward."
5,BuddahBear,I‚Äôm finding these tests and exercises very helpful and difficult. But I‚Äôm pleased so far. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. Some tests and games have shown to be very beneficial to expanding your knowledge and hand eye coordination etc.
1,CSI Rocks!,"After answering a bunch of questions, you get to the end and it‚Äôs immediately asking for you to pay or to try a free 3-day trial. The moment I saw that, I exited and deleted the app.  Things like that usually ask for information and start charging you even if you cancel. For something that gives fun tests, etc you don‚Äôt need my info and once they get it, it‚Äôs hard to refute charges. No thanks."
1,patriotpatty,I downloaded the app and tried the free trial for maybe 5 minutes. I then received a notification from my bank I had purchased a YEAR long subscription. I emailed the support email right away with no response. I waited a couple days and emailed again with an automatic response asking not to duplicate issues‚Ä¶ so I then wait 10 days and still nothing back from them. What a joke.
5,Authentic7!,I really enjoy this app because it has a great array of games ! I enjoy learning  and with this app it is opportunity to strengthen  my skills and reaction time .  It‚Äôs really helpful . Also is something healthy to do ! Awesome ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüìö
5,$@veMe,"I really didn‚Äôt know where is going without this, I feel like I‚Äôm finding a new chapter in my life because of this app and the way it helps you find who you are."
4,Nancy H Itunes,I am adhd and struggle to keep focused on tasks. This is easy to work on for short periods and I feel it‚Äôs improving my focus and ability.  I struggle to pause a game when being interrupted by a call or pet interruption.
5,MrCorazon,"Really provides a variety of games that test different aspects of mental acuity( focus, memory, attention to detail, etc). Plus- a variety of tests to analyze different aspects of self exploration. Really interesting app. Ive enjoyed it"
5,Cvhtsfhurfhjh,This app is challenging in all the right ways! Exposes areas of vulnerability in my thinking while mixing the right amount of content that makes me feel on target with keeping my brain sharp!
5,Jessica borden87,I like this game because it‚Äôs really exciting exercising my brain everyday and it‚Äôs only a few short games to keep u going everyday. It‚Äôs not like I have I spend all day doing it if I choose not to.
1,RosieAus,"I looked into this app because of an FB ad, thinking it could be a decent time killer with its puzzles and tests. However, I immediately got their subscriptions shoved into my face. When I opted to skip paying, every little action was met with a long ad. And at that point I‚Äôm not going to bother fighting through ads just to see if this is something worth paying for."
2,Ozzyrelius,"Too many ads mid-game so much so that I think I‚Äôm spending more time on ads than on the actual games. Disrupts whatever focus and engagement you gained from playing the games, that I see no benefit in using the app for free. And the paid schemes are way out of what I want to spend, specially since I had a bad time with the free version."
5,ALewis37,I have been enjoying these exercises and my kids have been participating too! It‚Äôs been interesting to see how different parts of my brain outperform or which parts need developing.
5,Nanz_1,I enjoy playing the games on this app the challenges really make you think and use you brain. I would definitely recommend purchasing this app.
5,jayhern,I love spending time on this app . Not only does it help me in many different ways but it‚Äôs also very entertaining I could spend an hr on this app and not even notice ! So much fun definitely recommend!
5,Ebola02,"Impulse is an excellent app to train your brain functionality in a wide array of topics and to improve with memory, speed, etc. I recommend everyone to give this app a try."
5,Mariam_10,Not only do you improve several cognitive skills but you have fun while doing it! Very entertaining and informative. I look forward to my 10 mins/day training sessions with excitement.
5,Slug stocks are expected,this review will be short but i‚Äôd like to say even for the free version and a couple ads here and there i live this app it has increased my focus time but a lil and i‚Äôve only used this app for two days or atleast i‚Äôd say i also like the mini games they have you can do daily and the ones you can do just for fun whenever you want and any to all of the time thank you creators for making this app and have a blessed rest of your day.
1,Miss Portinari,Says I have a three day free trial and after I‚Äôll be billed.  So why isn‚Äôt everything unlocked with this free trial? Why am I constantly being pressed every thirty seconds to subscribe to an annual plan?  Obnoxious. Just incredibly obvious greed given you can‚Äôt even let people try your app without asking for money nonstop. You lost me as a customer because if you hadn‚Äôt done this I might not have cancelled before I could be charged.
4,Ethan Edward,"Everything so far has been great. Paywall isn‚Äôt too expensive, especially if you buy for the year. The games are all fun and inviting and give me something to do aside from just scrolling endlessly on social media."
5,Odysseus 14,"The first thing one uses while watching the examples is the linear as well as the vertical methods of solving the sequence of objects.  When using these methods of thinking, even the professional models become easier."
5,Meer904,"You dont even realize you are training your brain because the games are so fun!! Quick and easy and doesnt take up much time unless its you wanna keep going. Self paced, interactive & creative"
4,#awsome stuff,"I love this game it relieves stress and is fun. I love logic puzzles and games which is exactly what this is. HOWEVER, it costs a lot of money to get test scores back and they don‚Äôt tell you that until AFTER you‚Äôve done the 20-65 question quiz. This is the only reason why it lost a star"
5,Tamalero :D,"Really making me think, process, evaluate, resolve and better my reactions! I do recommend this app for those who don‚Äôt like playing games but do enjoy puzzles and critical thinking games."
5,Yearlette Taylor,It has been less than 24 hours since I have been using this app and I am pleasantly surprised. I can tell that my cognitive function is being expanded and exercised.
5,Olliesmama31,"No complaints! I love playing the games and taking the tests, I‚Äôve only been using it for a few days but I can‚Äôt wait to start seeing a difference (or I hope I should say)"
5,primsheniece,"But if I had the money right now, I would definitely get a subscription. I love how the games make you think while having fun. And its a great way to releases dopamines, so I stay playing for a while.ü•π good app"
5,mason578568,"Keeping my brain  on alert.  Exercising all the capabilities and function of your mind.  The app has tests, puzzles, and games to keep you interested and coming back for more."
1,KRS373737,And it was good. Plenty of good games that I liked playing but recently they started putting in ads that took you out of the game and into the Internet automatically. It even happened during a level instead of between levels like it usually does. I don‚Äôt like that it can automatically open a website without my permission so I had to delete it.
5,Ocasio,This app does make you use your brain. Just started so still on the easy ones and looking forward to the levels ahead.
4,Tasha Banks 04,Got this game for my husband because he had a stroke nearly a year ago. I  am hoping to help rebuild his memory and cognitive abilities by using games like this. I also downloaded it for myself so he won‚Äôt be in this alone. So far I like it for the both of us.
3,Cookingkristin,"I knocked off 2 stars because the app pushes you to upgrade to the paid version every step of the way and the ads feel extra long to annoy you into purchasing the AD free version. Feels aggressive and manipulative. However if you take away those hurdles, it's great and I like the games and exercises very much."
5,Brain is brainin,The games are fun and I feel like they do make my brain work a little bit which is what I‚Äôve been needing as I feel like my memory isn‚Äôt great and Im not in school anymore.
4,Unique_chi,"I like the brain activities it makes me feel like I still have it. Now that I am getting older I want to start while I am young to continue to use my brain to reduce the effect of the saying, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it.‚Äù"
3,12289900,"So out the gate I love the app. Well at least so far. I love the different games, a lot of them are games I have played before just in one place. The different test are pretty nice but I really will just be using the daily Brian boosting games  What will keep me from using the app is the price. Plain and simple."
5,JoynerDD,It‚Äôs everything I need.  I suffered a massive lupus episode in 2014.  It resulted in spinal cord injury and brain injury.  I am also now in my mid 50‚Äôs.  I am always looking for ways to help myself get better and this for sure is a great way to start!!!  SO SO SO Grateful
5,DarfNader,The puzzles start out very basic but increase in difficulty as you play over time. Something about these games make them kind of addictive.
1,DaylynM,This game has been taking money out my account for the subscription. I‚Äôd be better for an option to pay the subscription or if I don‚Äôt pay it can cancel my subscription until but NO it just automatically take money out your wallet an doesn‚Äôt even tell you. This was horrible and never getting again. I want my refund ASAP I and I mean it!!!!üò°üò°
5,GringainFL,This is far better than many other games and puzzles. It is more functional and different from the normal games
5,tami666zx,"I do the free. I don‚Äôt pay for it yet has a bit of ads. But, I don‚Äôt mind. It helps me with this challenge games which is nice. Overall, this is a good app wounded how it is when it‚Äôs paid. I‚Äôll have to check that out."
5,vckjcncfnciknicd nlovxf,For times I find myself aimlessly scrolling I will go on this app instead and do things that actually improve my ability to think faster and reduce stress
5,Fl4koKilla,I have always tried other brain game apps but so far I have found that Impulse is by far the best and more fun of all they seem like games but have literally helped my memory
5,MissyBee13,I enjoy the entire setup of this app. All the games/puzzles are really fun and I can tell my skills are getting sharper. I am currently very happy with my decision to choose this one over all the others.
4,crackedpepperginger12360,I think this game is very brain activating with adhd and it did help get my brain a little active and some games I liked more then others but I wreak I liked the game and would recommend it for some who are bored or have bad adhd and can‚Äôt focus very well
5,SuzieFrogASL,Playing games that help train your brain instead of indulging in mindless garbage or negative content- it‚Äôs a total game changer. Everyone should use this. Incredible. I may have to upgrade! üòçü§üüèº
5,JareKen98,Very fun and creative way to keep your mind sharp. I‚Äôve been using it for a week now and look forward to the new challenges every day! 10/10 recommended this app
5,Glorrila,I was so mad and I started playing the game and it helped me  release my madness so every time I‚Äôm mad or sad I‚Äôll play this amazing game ‚Ä¶ I love this game so much because it help my feelings. You should get this game if your an emotional person
5,This-Is-How-I-Rock,So I use impulse and it is very hard for me to focus and concentrate in class so when I heard of impulse I decided to give it a try and it worked so parents let your kids do impulse if they can‚Äôt focus.üòçüëçüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èüòéüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
5,cihcfcgyyf,"when it tells you that you should pay, its just so you can play more and you dont have any ads. you can pay or not it dorsnt give you any ‚Äúpremium‚Äù games!"
5,vwspeed03,The best brain game out there! I especially like the information that it provides back to me on how I stand up to the other users after each game/test.
5,justice and Layla,So I just wanted to write this review to share about this game because it has helped me with a lot I am very much smarter than I was before I played this game and it really helped me so thank you who ever invented this game
5,KitTITass Cunty,For me apps like this end up being either really annoying or really boring. so far I have actually enjoyed using impulse and plan to continue so long as this remains true.
5,baseball player 37,"So I know how you have to pay, but you don‚Äôt have to. This game is fun without the subscription. You can still set up a daily goal, but I‚Äôve passed the goal and got hooked on playing this!"
5,tatntude,"I‚Äôve been using this app for just two days so far. I love it so far. Given a bit more time to truly see any results, I then will come back with a more detailed review."
5,KotaBlueDoe,"Honestly even though I just installed it I already like the fact that it didn‚Äôt force me to pay , I really like the set up of the app, the design, choice of colors, and the games."
5,nicdmaster,It has a variety of options and really does help and if using a membership its beyond useful what's 30 a year for a more productive mind you make that back and beyond then some it's price is a steal
5,Ash68BooBoo,"I am 28 years old and I don‚Äôt normally play games or read or anything like that, but this game gives me all of the above and its fun!! It makes me try to do better and better each time to beat score"
5,Pierre Jr.,I enjoy brain games and this app has a variety of different brain games. They slowly progressively get harder which is awesome so you don‚Äôt get bored once you get the hang of it.  Highly recommend.
5,MusicallyInTune,I am glad I can keep gaming but actually so something connected to bettering myself as well. The IQ test are awesome also. I brought the yearly subscription after 1 day. I loved it that much.
5,paddingtonk,There is a large variety of games and puzzles. There are also a lot of programs to do each day/week to keep thing interesting.
2,MauiGuy57,"The actual brain games & tests are wonderful, there are just waaaay too many ads, and they are super long.  Literally get a 30 second pop-up after every game you play.  This is obviously done on purpose to push people into paying the monthly/yearly ad free option.  Unless you plan on paying for the subscription, don‚Äôt waste your time."
5,brandon111133532,it helps to know that even when you are just ‚Äúpassing time‚Äù you can be doing something so productive and helpful for your body. It feels like you are actually nourishing your brain.
5,zaireto,I like impulse so far! Since I‚Äôm too lazy to pay for the full thing I just started with the free part but it‚Äôs nice and I like it! I feel the burn already! Or maybe something is actually burning üòÖ
1,hhhsgdferrteyyhdh,This is a free app to download and I know it says in app purchases but I started the IQ test and it gave you 20 minutes to finish. When I finished it wouldn‚Äôt give me the report without signing up to be aPremium member. When I hit the X it‚Äôs at oh you don‚Äôt want to be a premium member get your report for $4.99. this is a joke. Companies like this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to sell their product on this marketplace without full disclosure.
5,DV929,"So far so good, only thing is you have to pay for the other games, which I get it‚Ä¶ but I feel if it had a few more ‚Äúfree‚Äù mind games, it would take it to the next level!"
5,Liz1545,"This is the first app that I‚Äôve come across that actually gets me excited to exercise my brain! If you‚Äôre experiencing brain fog, stress, lack of motivation etc., download this app! It‚Äôs a huge dopamine booster"
5,Mai Jade,This is a fun way to challenge yourself. I‚Äôve come to find out I‚Äôm smarter in places I don‚Äôt give myself credit in. And also finding that the places I thought I didn‚Äôt need practicing needs practice ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,nickelsak,"It‚Äôs a very helpful app, I really am awful at math and the fact it‚Äôs helping me with that Is amazing!ü§© I love the mini games they have it just takes my mind off of everything and focus and relax, That‚Äôs all I need in life atp <3"
5,Sekhmet!16,Today was my second day playing the game and my anxiety has minimized.  I love how it makes me use my brain compare to social media platforms that have 0 productivity unless promoting a brand or product.  Love this game
5,Xiao is emo,"I thought i would drop it after a while but it has good games along with free brain training, plus you can take an iq test along with it? I cant thank the devs enough"
4,nadine427,It exercises my brain and helps me realize things about myself I didn‚Äôt know before. It‚Äôs a good app the only thing that could be better is the price. I‚Äôll probably delete it before it renews but if it was free I‚Äôd definitely use it every day!
5,ShottyBughatti,Honestly it‚Äôs a fun way to get your brain working. Personally I like it cus it‚Äôs distracting and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm just wasting my time. Does a great job at explaining the games instructions. Overall a cool way to challenge yourself.
5,MentalDeficit,I love this. It‚Äôs really helping my mind power but I hate that I have to pay so much for it.  I have a lot of financial issues but need to build my brain power with the mental issues I have.  I do love it and it works great
5,Arxilla,"I struggle with memory and focus, this app has helped so much! It also lets you choose a time you want to be reminded which is great because if there wasn‚Äôt I would forget. Love this app totally recommend!ü§ç"
5,SuperDangerDave,"I started using Impulse while recuperating from brain surgery, as I needed the rehab. That was 2.5 years ago‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm still using it every day! I really enjoy it, AND think it‚Äôs helped my brain recover!!"
4,uclfykgdyffjfkdykcvu,I am so exited this helps me get smarter and soon I‚Äôm going to be the smartest kid in class. Totally recommend!!! I love how it gives you different games but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the ads or how you only get a specific time to play each day but over all this game is awesome must try!!
5,"38!,4$995:,","I love the games, puzzles, tests, and challenges. I especially love that I had the option to buy it forever and not just do a subscription-based service."
3,Jesufollower,We really like this app however when we signed up we signed up for a lifetime subscription. Now we are being charged yearly for the app. Developers shouldn‚Äôt offer a lifetime subscription and then change it to yearly with no notice about doing so.
5,Nekitabc,"I just downloaded it today and I‚Äôm quite addicted, I wanted to use something that would help me with my attention issues while strengthening my brain power. I‚Äôm loving it so far!!"
5,Nicci Fresh,Impulse is a spectacular app to help keep you brain sharp and develop new skills as well. I‚Äôve only been on it a few days and I can already tell the difference!
5,Mommemouse,I‚Äôve started doing this rather than scrolling through Facebook!
5,Garden Shoes,"I am 77 years old and not a tech person at all.  When I came upon Impulse, I thought it would be so hard.  I play the games to exercise my brain and keep dementia at bay.  This is a senior friendly game."
5,MizJen2u,This is really intriguing to test your brain in multiple different ways.  I enjoy knowing how I did against others. I am excited to keep going.
5,Bigbragger1993,"Impulse has been a real brain training course and has really challenged me to think quicker, better, and improved my overall recall."
5,CocoMoshu,"The brain games are very engaging, they‚Äôre fun and not overwhelming. They‚Äôre also simple and quick with different difficulty levels. It‚Äôs definitely worth trying out!"
5,Instrctr7,"The games are both fun and helpful.  While you enjoy a game, it is also helping your brain with memory, focus, classifying, math, etc.  I highly recommend to improve your thinking skills."
5,Lizprin,"I don‚Äôt like to pay for many things on my phone , but I really love all the games and training exercises on this app. I absolutely love that it says what percentage you are with your peers."
4,flowerfixer,"I‚Äôm only on day two, but I think this is going to be a great mind tightener if you will. It‚Äôs going to help with focus calculation and direction. I‚Äôm looking forward to more days of training and it may be a higher score the further I get in."
5,naotenhopaciencia,I absolutely love the variety of options they have and the design of each and every game. Definitely suitable for different kinds of people
3,Nikkixanz,Candy Sort is my absolute favorite game to play on Impulse. It had some bugs so I couldn‚Äôt play for a while. It finally got updated and now the gameplay feels completely different. It‚Äôs not the same anymore. And I was on level 990!! üòì other games are fun I guess.
5,RunsNearForests,This app is awesome in it‚Äôs variety and acuity!  The games or challenges that are categorized had an immediate feeling of brain activation. The sensation of different parts of my brain having to work to complete tasks was very new and exciting!
2,randomdude_79,"Honestly, this app is amazing, and I completed all the puzzles which there are 188 of. However, there is an achievement that is given to you when you complete 250 puzzles. While including the bonus puzzles, there is a total of 219 puzzles this means that it is impossible to get that achievement. Impulse, please fix this.  Edit #1: 3 months, no response. Edit #2: 6 months, no response. IMPULSE"
5,cbt089,Something better to do than rot your brain with the opinions of a bunch of random people. Here‚Äôs a way to get out of the habit of just clicking those apps.
5,Walking mental illness,"Impulse helped me a lot with my mental health , they don‚Äôt charge you (optional) for, doesn‚Äôt need adult confirmation; so if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with showing your parents/ guardian, this is the perfect solution for you!"
4,Alatisia.,"I am obsessed with this game. The only down sided about this game, is that after every game that you play, it gives you an ad. I hope that the people who created this game decide to make this game an AD FREE game. Thank you for reading.   -Me"
5,ChrisW12345,The app is well designed and the games are challenging. Looking forward to seeing how long I will stay interested in it. Hopefully the devs keep adding new things as time goes by.

5,Lamaj2424,"Impulse is a great way to keep the brain sharp. Instead of scrolling randomly online, impulse allows you to develop in many areas mentally that can translate into your daily life."
5,NnjC101,I really like the amount of different categories of games. I enjoy the daily challenges and can see how this will improve/impact my brain from decline. Its worth the fee to subscribe. It‚Äôs gaming with a purpose.
5,Virago76,"Even though a lot of the exercises ‚Äúseem‚Äù rudimentary, they are actually quite stimulating as far as focus and cognition. The short duration of each exercise keeps you easily engaged."
5,jay.hipster,It‚Äôs absolute fun like the colors and the simplicity of it makes it feel like a game that you wouldn‚Äôt want to give up on and it challenges you to beat your previous score
5,Kiersten+Brian,"It is challenging but not in a way I don‚Äôt want to keep doing it! I always wanna try again and keep doing the next challenges , I also love leaving about myself the more I do it!"
5,zzzzzzsssssssd,This is actually fun while your still testing your brain skills to see how well your memory still works and see if you retained what you learned back in school
5,hannak09,My memory has improved quite a bit I didn‚Äôt think this would help but the things that I have been improving on is great

4,Noel_lanson,"I was expecting a few features to be available because there was a monthly plan but it actually has a bunch of free features you can do, but you have to watch an add liek every 2 or 3 test so that‚Äôs not fire but yk >:,( good game though"
5,Hekeocnfnjwoznxur,100% would recommend to everyone! I‚Äôm so grateful for this app as it has helped me understand myself better whilst challenging me to sharpen my brain skills
3,aqua marien,"It a cool game, but when you put the word free on a game app whatever app it is. It should be free, not tell people after it explains what the app is and ask questions. I don‚Äôt really recommend it unless you like spending money on apps that ask for money."
5,BFdalover,This app is wonderful. I do sessions three times a day to make sure I keep my mind sharp throughout the day. I like the games and problems the app have as well. It‚Äôs definitely worth it. üëçüèæüëçüèæ
5,Dummynnbbv,I've never tested a brain training app and since I have used this one I have loved it this app makes trading your brain fun and challenging you should definitely download this game

5,Fun but‚Ä¶there‚Äôs this thing,"Tired of games and all the ads other than that it‚Äôs fun, just miss the days when we could download an app and play it without being bombarded with nonsense constantly"
5,juper012482,Impulse brain training is an engaging and interactive program that I find highly enjoyable. It not only provides entertainment but also helps me sharpen my focus and prepare myself for the challenges of the day.
5,Trini mom of 2,This game is exactly like advertised! So many time you get tricked into buying something just to find out it‚Äôs not the type of brain games you expect. This is what I saw and more. It‚Äôs fun and challenging
5,DezzyPurp,It‚Äôs an interesting app that is highly interactive and creative throughout any challenge they put you through in order for you to be a better you.
5,mommyof3girls2020,I just started this app a few days ago. I think it does have the potential to do brain training over time for sure.
5,PrincessAeileita,So far I have actually been enjoying this game. It‚Äôs challenging but it helps a lot. I like all the different features in the pro mode because there‚Äôs more that I can do and play
5,DteresaT,I‚Äôve done many brain training apps and this is by far the best.  It‚Äôs held my interest far longer because of the number and types of different games and challenges.
2,J Alexandra,I get that you need to monetize the app but the ad playing after every 1 minute exceecise and having ads you can easily click out even 30 seconds after they start is ridiculous. Don‚Äôt bother downloading this app unless you like  a ton of the same ads over and over again!
5,JCT_104,"It‚Äôs a nice and fun way to exercise your brain without complications, the app is super user friendly and I highly recommend it. I love it! Don‚Äôt waste your time playing dumb games, instead keep your brain sharp!"
2,M. Ford,App is extremely pushy to purchase a subscription. You can‚Äôt even complete one quiz or two clicks without them begging you to subscribe. Got this fully intending to use it and wanted to try it out before committing but Jfc it‚Äôs annoying. I had it for about five minutes before I was frustrated and deleted the app.
5,Moma Monroe,This is a very cool app. I just paid for the Life Time thing. I‚Äôm starting my day with different exercises to wake me up more. I‚Äôve been joyed it so far and will update after I have more time with this app.

5,Sorge9,I am a senior and thought that my memory was failing and beyond improvement. I have slowed with age but Impulse has made me realize I am better than I thought and will improve with continued learning.
5,Neriyah jean,It‚Äôs great for the brain and all these excercise improve are accuracy the challenges we face I personally love it for school work even tho it‚Äôs summer but I still do school work download this app and you will have a great time
5,Dusty Girl 2015,"I don‚Äôt know if this is one of the benefits others get, but it seems my concentration has improved just from using this app a short time.  I‚Äôm loving it so far.üòä"
5,Brandymit,I have only been using the free version of this and have loved it! Many of the puzzles are similar to what I do with my gifted students and they cover many different areas.
1,App awesome!,If the ad that came on while I was using this app had come on when my son was playing I would have had the heads of these developers. Unbelievable that an app advertised for 4+ would allow very graphic adult content without a warning or option to disallow for age group. I feel violated for having even seen it. Huge thumbs down. Very disappointing.
5,Jung_cooks,Impulse is an amazing game that helps your concentration and anything else your looking for. Even without paying you still get many benefits witch are amazing!! 10 out of 10 recommend!!
4,Lil-CEAK-ChANcE,This app makes my brain work harder than it has in a while but I also set it for a harder level than I needed and it works a lot I‚Äôm so serious I can‚Äôt thank this app enough for how much it‚Äôs helped me these past few days!
5,PINK CHAIR,The challenges presented are very enjoyable! No annoying sound effects. Just plain fun. I especially like the daily reminders. Those keep me on track to get better at the task presented.
5,Mamaw1720,Impulse is a great app to have to challenge your mind! Helps to keep you more focused and you can test how quickly your brain takes in information! It‚Äôs an app worth the download
5,Tori number two,"There are not a crazy amount of adds like most games when you don‚Äôt pay for premium, plus the games are pretty fun and do help your brain grow!"
5,rcalli1034,This app makes me feel like spending time on my phone isn‚Äôt just a waste. It‚Äôs entertaining and also challenging. I‚Äôm a competitive person so it‚Äôs fun to see how I‚Äôm doing against others.
5,Toreto05,"This app has way too many LONG ADS, plus you have to pay just to unlock things!!! Waste of time downloading this app."
5,Cheyfire,"I like there are multiple games every session. You can spend 5 minutes to 6 hours with these brain work games, they are fun, challenging, and could be addicting for some"
5,chamodadon,"Great so far, but then again these are just the intermediate levels. can‚Äôt wait to leave another review after my year subscription to see results"
5,yoyoyotogo,Pretty good app! I like the different types of puzzles and it gives you results on your group how well you have done. It does get my brain going that‚Äôs for sure!
4,Allstar Jones,"Didn‚Äôt pay for the subscription since the ads are only 15-20 seconds long, but all the games keep me engaged enough to wait. Enjoy seeing how I compare to others playing the games as well."
5,phugnuton,I feel re-energized and better focus after just 3 games!   I also like the option to buy the game outright and not just subscription.
4,Makemesmileonce,"This is a great way to feel good about what you can accomplish with your brain, the reason for the 4 stars is because after each game you have to watch another ad‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs annoying, but still a great game!"
5,rckclimber4life,This is a game I need to play everyday. I can see it helping me with my memory. I've been looking for a game that's not only going to take my mind off of my problems but also help tremendously with my memory.
1,RPenman66,"I clicked on the 3 day trial.  It wouldn't allow me access unless I clicked what plan I wanted.  Have had other apps do the same thing.  You just have to cancel before the end of the trial if you don't want to continue.  Well I did that and it pushed it through as a purchase not trial.  Sent message to developer, and disputing with Apple.  Disappointed it would charge me rather than do what it was supposed to."
5,Gogokatie,"At first you‚Äôre like, oh I got this. And then you play and realize how impulsive you actually are. I love each test, puzzle, etc. Especially the tests that help you understand your personality & emotional intelligence more."
4,Damaged RN,"I suffered a severe neurological reaction from the Moderna Vaccine, complete with seizures and brain damage. I have lost my ability to work, and everyday activities often cause uncontrollable body movements. I am working hard to repair my brain and I think this app helps a lot! Thank you! Worth the price for me."
5,julieebaybee,"Love this app! It challenges my brain and helps me practice in the areas I am weak in. Over time my problem solving skills have improved, as well as my memory. Wonderful app! Would definitely recommend!"

5,bookworm344,"I know it‚Äôs said with many apps but this one has helped me with day to day activities and hiccups, as well as give me tests I never knew I needed to take. 10/10 recommend"
5,Eve.taylor72,"This app is great for sharpening your mental skills. There are activities that target different areas of focus. Just getting started with this‚Ä¶also, not paying extra and still getting great content."
5,hlensnanf,"As someone with attention issues, ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù provides both the right structure for my brain, and is fun and aesthetically appealing. It‚Äôs a wonderful, well-rounded app and I‚Äôm so here for it.  Aka I think it‚Äôs worth it, and I think you will enjoy it too."
5,Foxxxy Momma,I really like this app. I‚Äôve tried others before and this one is by far better. I like seeing where I excelled and where I need to work more. Thanks bunches.  That‚Äôs about it! Dang how much do you expect me to write
5,Terebella22,"This training involves unique games that are fun, get you thinking on your toes and strengthens those synapses in the brain.  I purchased it for the improved mental faculties but I find myself having fun and really enjoying it.  Great product."
5,BRax46,"If your trying to be on point of see better progress mentally, physically and spiritually you can do all of that once you do little habits like theses strategies and patterns help me out tons because I got ADHD. - Braxton Black"
5,Donald Thang,I want to improve myself. This app is what I hope the Lord Jesus will use to make me better . Thank you to all of you who work together as a team to create this awesome game. We need this in the world. God is awesome for making you guys so intelligent !!!
5,loyalty Guzman,Great for those who are not able to physically move around due to recovery but they can be able to exercise their mind and this is the perfect app for it to keep you sharp and functional
5,Trill Boiz,Impulse is very helpful if you feel like your brain is feeling lazy. Different varieties of levels to keep your brain sharp will definitely help with that issue. Definitely try this out!
5,djdjfjskekgiwjduwux,"This game is great for everything it is listed for;however, it‚Äôs memorization mini games are by-far the best. I have seen improvement and think you should get the game too!"
5,DesOrtiz88,"This is getting me in a routine, making me take a break, stimulating my brain, helping me wind down, and lastly learn a lot more about me and how I am and how I do things. Beat of all its really fun and keeps you sharp."
3,borchgacesucker,"I love this app! It‚Äôs really entertaining but, in between every challenge is an ad. Every time. It‚Äôs really annoying and it‚Äôs not like a ‚Äúyou skip once and it‚Äôs over ad,‚Äù no. The same ad pops up three times and you have to close out of each one before you can continue. Waste of time."
2,JollyJoseph,"Like so many apps available now, the pricing is just not worth it. I play other similar games that I have purchased without subscription and for a tenth of the lifetime price that appear to be similar or better. The pricing is just ridiculous. So nope. Also, why do app developers not update the pricing in the App Store? It is showing different pricing for the same options. Seems to be a deliberate tactic. Why?"
5,JennA2122,I love the candy sorting game. This app definitely helps with working memory issues. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to pay for this app
5,Leonsita818,I downloaded this to help retrain my brain since I display many adhd symptoms. The exercises in this app are easy and quick therefore making it easy to incorporate into my day.
5,chel bell o,Honestly LOVE THIS APP. It seems so simple but I really feel a bit of a difference with my attention span and just simply being more on it with things.
5,BLawrence576,I have enjoyed this game for the last couple of years. It helps me feel more accomplished and confident in my mental tasks. This game is a fun way to improve my mind in so many ways.
5,not_kit13,"I love this so much bc I hate getting ads. The lifetime option to get no ads is why this is my favorite game. So many games, absolutely no ads. Best app on the market for avoiding doomscrolling"
5,D‚Äîrut,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews, but I think this app deserves one. I don‚Äôt know how accurate it is with its recordings, but it‚Äôs fun to use and will definitely keep you occupied for a while."
5,Room escape addict,I love impulse. Tons of variety of games so I never get bored. The quizzes are insightful and the training exercises keep me on my toes. 100% worth the money to go ad free. This is the only app I use every single day.
3,MrsMols,"I just updated the app and there are significant delays and issues with the candy sort game loading to present the board and the when moving the last piece, the screen freezes again. Please fix."
2,GrowthCoach,"Frustrating. Limited play experiences. Some games slow to load. Significant glitches. I shared my experiences multiple times and yet game continues to have significant problems with test tube color balls (candy sort, it's a sorting task I usually find relaxing but not in this app). Disappointed overall unfortunately."
5,Blaqcherokee,Brain power through stimulating games and tasks for self improvement while having fun at the same time. Highly recommend!
5,mushroom lover_4036,A few things I love this game it has helped me with focusing more and practicing being faster but fun it helps with finding yourself I enjoy it a lot and I hope you do tooüß†üå∫
5,Suzette32,"Like others said this app is worth the expense. I enjoy the exercises (games?). I tend to have poor short term memory a lot of the time and this app helps work on that. Plus, it‚Äôs fun! Highly recommend!"
5,CGB224,I don‚Äôt have much to say other than I actually really love this game it gives you fun and pretty challenging puzzles to work you brain and it‚Äôs surprisingly helping me a good bit reactivate my brain
4,Born this way!!,I like the games- some better than others. My only complaint is toooooo many ads! Really- some of them quite vulgar! And once you complete  level five-there are no new games added.
1,higgily,"I never subscribed for this godforsaken app, but I‚Äôve been charged weekly. If you download the app, be forewarned, they will find a way to charge you and it‚Äôs impossible to cancel. I have canceled this over 10 times emailed the company requested through Apple that they reimburse me for months and months of weekly charges but I‚Äôve been denied. If you download Impulse, you subscribe. And there‚Äôs no turning back."
5,gacbrittany,Helps me to focus more of my time and energy when I‚Äôm bored or stressed in a better direction. Life seems more enjoyable now and it has helped me a lot. I love the tests. Please add more I love them and it helps mental health a whole lot.
5,Ali1728,I just start to use these app and I really like it. Now instead of starting my day seeing instagram or Facebook I play my task of the day and it helps me to focus for a good start during the day.
5,I am so mad (read bottom),"Impulse is an amazing app were you could train you brain everyday! Impulse includes test, example: personality test and includes games to help train your brain to do stuff you would like to do. I recommend 10/10."
5,ZibbyMiles,This is great for mental health. It has many different exercises for many different topics.  It rates all levels of the mind so you can see where you need help and where you excel.  Very interesting!
4,slowjeremy,The games aren‚Äôt addictive. You don‚Äôt want to keep doing them. You only keep doing it bc it‚Äôs supposed to help your brain. The tests are cool but you may realize some things about yourself you do not enjoy. But that means room for improvement.
5,_ellapup_,"It‚Äôs fun and good for your brain.  Instead of spending time scrolling through angry posts or silly videos, this keeps you entertained, challenged, and helps you in the long run. Win win I say üòÅüëåüèº"
4,Busy_B23,I have enjoyed impulse app since the very first day. It has pretty good challenges that keep my mind alert and I start to notice the difference in my memory. Impulse has many different ways nd types to keep your cognitive skills in pretty good condition!
5,MayormMccheese,Only been a couple days but I‚Äôm enjoying the games so far! I got the lifetime pass just so I could have the games anyway for plane rides and stuff
5,Fmlinardo,Two days in & I love the games! They are interesting & different than some other I have played in the past. I shave also learned that I have ADHD and am now getting medicine for it. 5 stars
5,elliottdday,There are so many different ways to train your brain with this app. I‚Äôve been using it for more than a year now and it‚Äôs never let me down. So glad I got the lifetime pass.
5,Joesbabe,If time using an app like this.  Enjoying the challenge and change of pace. Thinking of making the purchase.
5,HeyHay1986,This app has allowed me to calm down and focus on just my brain. Plus tells me how smart I am!! I also love finding out more about myself. I really wish it was free. I‚Äôd be playing it all the time!!!
5,crowcindy13,I purchased this app to play the puzzle games to see if I was a genius lol. Little did I know it could help me improve my math skills. I hate numbers a little less with each math game it gives me to ‚Äúplay‚Äù.
5,Annie Sant,"I recently had a brain scan and it needs a lot of work. This app has installed a sense of fitness, and the fitness makes me feel like I can achieve the rehabilitation that my brain needs."
5,Yonniega,I like Impulse because it offers a variety of different activities to challenge your brain but challenges that are also fun. I highly recommend Impulse.
5,Gardenia70,Today is my second day of using the app. I have been looking for something to help my brain stay sharp. I can feel my brain waking up. It seems good so far.
5,Nicodemus 1,What to do in each game becomes perceptibly more challenging without making me feel like a dunce. So far so good.  Round 2 Something went wrong in my thinking but as an American I will bounce back and overcome adversity!
5,vdvfjfcsf sad hhbdvyxg,I like this game so far makes me feel a little bit sharper with each challenge. Definitely recommend if you want to strengthen your brain or even learn yourself more.
5,Lama17831,I‚Äôve been using the app several days and so far and enjoying using it Fun little games that aren‚Äôt too long but make you concentrate and exercise the brain.
2,Sb208646,The app can be fun and insightful but they give you virtually no information without paying a premium. Want to take literally any test? You waste your time taking the test only to find that you must buy a year subscription to access the results. It‚Äôs absurd and they aren‚Äôt up front about it at all.
2,Annok1994,"Update: Too many ads have killed the user experience. From 5 stars to 2 stars. ‚Äî- Compared to all the other brain games I have played, this has been one of the best. Right amount of difficulty with the right amount of quickness. Time will tell to see how good this will be for my 28 year old brain. Starting early."
5,Alex james mooney,"Its an amazing app, gives me something to work on while im at school bored that still keeps my brain stimulated instead of dumbing it down on brainless apps! 10/10 would recommend!"
5,Tetris Seven,"I truly enjoy the mental challenge and fun of playing the games and mental tests here!  Please, add more Tower of Hanoi levels!! That‚Äôs my favorite brain teaser and I‚Äôve been just re-playing the 30 levels over and over! Thanks!"
5,PrettyGemini77,"Absolutely love the game, yea it has ads but only a few seconds long and you can skip past. I will play this at least once a day to keep my mind busy."
5,G-Lo Rich,Just started today. I‚Äôm thinking this is going to be good for me. I‚Äôm 60 years old and I‚Äôm concerned always about my memory because my mother had Alzheimer‚Äôs.
5,XxS@mxX,I haven't had the game for a while but so far i‚Äôve had a great experience. It has lots of features even when you don't pay! I highly recommend it.
5,Friscogurl808,I‚Äôm enjoying using impulse. I appreciate the reminders. At first the notifications were just one more distraction but when I make the effort and play the daily games I feel accomplished. Loving it!
5,Empress Morgan,"Deleted my social media due to my overindulgent patterns. Decided to download an app where I can learn, focus and train my brain instead of endlessly scrolling on social media!!"
5,lilies1284,"Love the different brain training exercises. Simple math, memory games, selective attention games. Makes you think and pause for a few minutes. Try it! You‚Äôll be hooked."
5,Doode37,This app is soo refreshing compared to all the other mind numbing social media apps. Just use this app for a few minutes every day and your brain will thank you.
5,Elsey maylor,"Highly recommend brain exercises of any kind, but this app is better than a lot of the ones I‚Äôve tried."
5,buymyway,"Just started playing. I‚Äôm really enjoying the various exercises. They are stimulating and fun!  I have learned, however, that I shouldn‚Äôt wait until the end of the day to playüòâ"
2,Moviesmusic,The games are simple and you‚Äôll run through them quickly unless you‚Äôre cognitively challenged. Features such as Streak do not work (I play every day and it obnoxiously resets ‚Äústreak tracking‚Äù every few days). I can‚Äôt quite see how this app helps brain function but it def helps pass the time while sitting on the porcelain throne.
5,Rbinacooks,"Love this app. It‚Äôs really helpful in making quick decisions and it‚Äôs actually fun in the process. I‚Äôve had or having a health problem that‚Äôs terminal so anything I can do to stay sharp and focused, I‚Äôm all in!"
5,Monkeysmom11211022,"I love the games and daily training activities. Once I start, I find myself wanting to play more. Playing these for an hour or more helps my focus issues in my daily life."
4,Scope lab,"I just purchased this App this week.  I‚Äôm over 60 and needed to find a tool to help with mindfulness, focus and mental health.  So far, I‚Äôve really enjoyed the app and the different challenges and options it offers.  I‚Äôd definitely recommend it."
5,doogerwooter,"Impulse is a Great way to relieve stress and learn more about yourself, but it makes you pay to get certain things like, removing ads, playing certain games, ect. Other than that it‚Äôs amazing!"
5,maman2fois,"I enjoy playing each game as it‚Äôs challenging, stimulating and fun to play! I know it‚Äôs improving my focus, memory and attention span.  It also helps me to think quicker and make better decisions in my job."
1,Riss1987,I tried the free trial and was constantly bombarded into subscribing and paying. At least let us try the app without the truly constant stream of requests for payment in order to get a feel for it. That made me absolutely never want to purchase the app! The game shown in the ad that made me want to do the trial wasn‚Äôt even available in the demo. I don‚Äôt understand how this has 4.7 stars.
5,Cadmael,"Fun app for some brain work. Wish it would have gave a bit more with the free portion but not disappointed with the paid for. Don‚Äôt pay yearly, there is a lifetime version that‚Äôs $10 more then the yearly."
5,roritoocool,"This app is very user friendly, as someone who doesn‚Äôt have the subscription the advertisements are bearable and the games are fun and help my brain skill levels. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun brain game, and very addictive!"
5,A-GamePeacock,Helps to know the games I play using impulse are beneficial towards building brain power instead of spending time scrolling through apps that are only making me dumber üòÇ
5,Alphoria,I got the free trial just wanting to improve my memory. On day two and the apps still keeping me engaged and wanting to do more. Would recommend to others for sure.
5,N8 miller,These games are really fun and the app is quick so you aren‚Äôt waiting for things to load or slow graphics to play.
1,Greenftw,This app isn‚Äôt free and it‚Äôs very expensive ( even though they let you ¬´ get lucky ¬ª by giving you and everyone else 92% off in the first 2 mins (maybe you do need brain exercise if you can‚Äôt see through that..) The games don‚Äôt function properly either (candy in the tubes.. don‚Äôt move the candies you select? Huh?  This is my first App Store review because this app really was the bad.
5,bickivkl,After having my left hippocampus removed (where our memory mostly is) this has really helped!
4,sweet lauralee,"I like most of the tests and games and I am trying to keep my brain healthy.  A few of them make me kind of anxious, but perhaps as I get better over time, that won‚Äôt happen.  I think this will be a good way to keep my brain sharp."
1,The Grandverbalizer,Take caution as this app will swindle you into being tricked into purchasing a subscription.   I accepted the 3 day trial and played through a round. At the end of the round I got a prize which was a percentage off of the subscription. You can‚Äôt proceed until you select a paid subscription. I clicked one and was immediately charged. This was within minutes of me accepting the trial.  The 3 day trial was null and void.   The App is Okay. But NOT that good.
5,youpickyhenickname,Impulse is fun because it includes difficult levels.   Some almost seem too hard!  I enjoy the challenge.  I couldn't believe I got an ok/even good score on some levels.
5,JUST STOP DAMMIT,I really like how it lets you play games whenever. Most apps like this only allow one game a day but even on the free version you still have the option for the free games.
5,MoodySobh,"I made the mistake of getting 1 year for $40 instead of $50 for lifetime, unfortunately they can‚Äôt reverse this mistake unless I talk to apple :( also I like how often this app notifies you to play!"
5,Gwynny Poo,This game is great because instead of waking up and not knowing the first thing to do with yourself you can go straight to brain training and help your body and mind naturally know what to do next.
1,auraviolet,I clicked on take test on an Instagram ad for this app. I did not take me to a test and asked me about myself and then immediately asked me to subscribe. I click the X in the corner I did not want to subscribe. But then it took me straight to the next screen as if I was a subscriber without my permission and appeared I was subscribed on a three day trial and then would be charged there after really really really upsetting to me not cool at all false advertising
5,J_Kav,"I now have cognitive, executive functioning, and memory issues due to Covid. This game is fun to use and hopefully will help. Frustrating because I used to be so much better at these things."
5,fugygdhtv,This app has help me so much I love it and give give it the same review I do I really love this game it‚Äôs Help over with anxiety it‚Äôs made my brain is super sharp and my bank my brain is like so intact and I have a problem with anxieties it really helps
5,"Laurie , SC","Best brain games app!‚Ä¶so much variety, it‚Äôs just what the doctor ordered for me to fight off generational dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs !..and it‚Äôs so much fun that I have a hard time turning it off!‚Ä¶I highly recommend this app for those looking for fun mental exercise!!"
5,nikkidank90tree,It is definitely challenging and I love a challenge. It‚Äôs also helping me learn to focus and not get frustrated so easily. Also feels good to be using my brain and getting a routine to give my brain a challenge everyday.
5,June Johnson,"I came for the IQ Test, but I stayed for the activities. It‚Äôs got great daily brain activities that help improve focus and brain dexterity. It‚Äôs a nice break for social media that helps me improve the quality of my thinking skills."
5,Levyman,"I rarely add apps to my Home Screen and this one made it. Starting every day with this one as part of my morning routine. Smart app, gradually challenging over time‚Ä¶ highly recommend."
5,TinCup@7,I stumbled upon this app while I was scrolling through my Instagram. Wondering what it would be like I downloaded the app and started playing it. It is truly amazing. Great job. I would recommend this to every friend.
5,shaunship,This is an amazing game you can play a lot of different things without paying a dime of course there are a decent amount of adds and there is a premium plan to play more but overall it‚Äôs a great game
5,Jlyah121800,This app is actually fun and I look forward to the three games I play every morning. Highly recommend if you like a little challenge or just want to exercise your brain. Great for all ages :)
5,KArtthurTerry,I appreciate the subtle notifications saying come on and play for a bit. They also gives tips telling you other ways to improve brain health and that‚Äôs astounding
5,Buddhamamma 6,Great fun and good way to exercise one‚Äôs brain. Can choose games or go with what comes up. Very enjoyable and one gains a great sense of completion of something from beginning to end. Even a few minutes a day helps!
4,KYMBERLEE21,"So far I am enjoying this app minus the ads, it warms my brain up in the mornings and challenge my cognitive skills and also my motor skills. I am currently in college, so this helps me to be able to dissect information as briskly as possible when taking tests!!!"
5,TwinDad57,I love the interactive games! I feel like it is a great way to start your day. I love the IQ test feature. I am thoroughly impressed with how user-friendly the app is so far. 10/10 would recommend.
4,Avery_theActress,"There are so many games that could be unlocked if you bought it, and it‚Äôs really annoying‚Ä¶ so if there were more games that you didn‚Äôt have to pay for, I would give it five stars, no doubt."
5,Lucy from the bed,That game got me fckd !! up because I have no clue how to hll I could not pic out a ‚Äúpair‚Äù when it was right in front of me there‚Äôs something ?! clearly there is something wrong with me and this app is on to it ! They got my attention
5,fififi937,I am new to this app but am really enjoying the fun games and also the informative tests to understand how my brain works and improve my memory. Highly recommend!
5,Researchchick,In just a few minutes a day you can help improve your brain health with fun activities and games! Definitely worth the time and money spent on yourself or your loved one.
5,Purple Arangutang,"I love this game more than anything!!! But that‚Äôs not all. There‚Äôs a whole lot of stuff that needs fixing and it‚Äôs just kind of getting on my nerves.   But other than that, it‚Äôs pretty awesome.  XOXOXO"
5,Sniper351,"I‚Äôm just on day 2 and the games are educational, but fun too. I will gain brain strength and learn how my ADHD brain works to make it my super strength rather than a burden. Just in the 2 days I have learned my IQ, learned my type of ADHD, exercised my superpower!"
5,Obijade,I have been doing my free trial and I love it. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn or want to change their mind space. Great job on the app and keep reaching for the stars!
5,Cubbs805,"Impulse is a great game to help improve your brain function with many exciting mini games/puzzles. Some help improve focus, others help with peripheral vision, & many others. Gotta give it a try."
5,Lola24!!!,I really enjoyed this game. It makes you think and it also offers positive reinforcement when you do well. It‚Äôs not time-consuming. It‚Äôs quick and easy and fun!
5,chadleyatx,Just started using the app and really enjoy how intuitive and well thought out it is. I‚Äôm fully expecting to genius level intellect by the time I‚Äôm through üòÜ
5,AzSuper2,I have been using this app for a couple days and so far it looks very promising to help me get to where I want to be as a human being whilst making it a fun experience that I want to do.
5,JakesInKhakis,This app truly is something to be valued. I was able to pay for the whole year for a reasonable price and now instead of doom scrolling I'm actually training my brain.
5,notvintage,it‚Äôs fun and full of variety and i don‚Äôt get a whole bunch of ads if any. definitely recommend this one if you like puzzles and stuff. but the cool down games are fun too.
5,Produxion,"Neat little app for sharpening skills in pretty much every aspect of brain function, word games, math problems, attention and focus, memory. Excellent app to help pass time and sharpen brain skills at the same time."
5,howdoesithappen,Some games are relaxing & some really put ur skills to the test fun to test yourself & practice certain ones while you‚Äôre able to see your progress.
5,CodeFRED_,I love this game already and it‚Äôs only been 2 days! Helps keep your brain functions sharp and activated otherwise they‚Äôll go limp üòÇ so very helpful and love the change daily on the games!
4,The Makeup Maven,The ads that pop up for other games are terrible content! They have nothing to do with the concept of this app. I want to delete this app because of the ads they have allowed.
5,QueenRhea26,I love this game so much. It exercises your brain and makes you make sense of thing. Really help you sharpened your mind and fir you to think about what you're trying to solve. Everyone should TRY this GAME. Its Awesome!
5,BASTIANNA,"It‚Äôs a great way to keep the grey matter working, and you can play for as long or short a time as you wish with many different game and puzzles.  Enjoy!"
2,FrozenBlaze1700,"Ik that the entire idea of a company is to make money but come on, they have ADS EVERY level (30ish seconds), yet even after completion, the user can‚Äôt even see their score after sitting through tens of ads during a timed test. There is also a knockoff wordscape in it tho (it‚Äôs Alr), so if wordscapes takes too much phone storage, this is your app."
4,Staldo,"Stretches your brain in different ways than the daily grind, which is always a good thing. One of the visual riddles was torn straight out of the movie Men in Black,(child reading a physics book is an alien) which kind of bothered me. Come up with your own thing guys."
4,Corliss Cogan,"I thoroughly enjoy Impulse aside from the lack of visual contrasts between some of the games‚Äô color contrast. Also I train on my iPhone & the visuals are at times very crowded & small‚Ä¶ Some games I find too repetitive, however the sense of accomplishment is a welcome reward‚Ä¶"
5,The Only Mr. Trick,"While I have trouble keeping up with being daily- that‚Äôs my own problem. This game is comforting, creative and genuinely there when I need it. Totally recommend!"
1,HonestHamster,You have to pay for basically everything like if you take a test you have to pay for the results! It‚Äôs so annoying and doesn‚Äôt help it just makes me mad and I have ADD and OCD. If you have either of those mental disorders DO NOT GET THIS APP! This is a scam for money and don‚Äôt help! Just play other games even ones with adds are better than this trash. I can now not focus and it is hard for me to write this.
5,crxstxna,Not sure if my mental acuity has improved any but the app is well built and the interface aesthetic is pleasingly consistent. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll run out of candy sort levels soon
5,Teeordieia,When you are retired from working. Your brain cells can start to slow down. This is a great way to keep them busy and productive.
5,tlawbueghgal,"I have always been skeptical of these ‚Äúbrain training Apps‚Äù, however Impulse lived up to its name Day One! I woke up with the IMPULSE to improve my brain fitness! It‚Äôs fun and challenging, just the way I like physical fitness training!"
5,sapoti21,"I enjoy the large variety of games, and there are all a lot of fun. I find when I‚Äôm consistent with using this app it truly does make a difference in memory, patterns, and so on and so forth."
5,396279292638,Games are quick and informative. The simple games give insight to deeper brain functions and the results tell you how your scores compare with others
4,hey guys i,"It‚Äôs got a good free to play system where you can enjoy the games each day and still have some free to play content afterwards, even the tests I‚Äôve taken I‚Äôm able to see the results but not the full report on the free version."
5,RP_UND,This app allows me to train my brain in a fun way with new challenges daily that make you think them through and feel accomplished once completed.
5,CourtieHope,"This app is fun, exciting, interesting, knowledgeable and informative! You can excel in growth here- challenge your brain and learn more about your skills & discover more about yourself! Enjoy!! :-)"

5,teresahilton,"I work with patients in my field who suffer dementia and was curious how the App could help, knowing brain fatigue and memory loss comes with age!  I find it fun and also informative, I learn as I play and it‚Äôs good for my brain!"
3,Emily80811111,This app is pretty good and the games are somewhat helpfull. There are 2 things that I want fixed. 1 Thing is the free trial. You should not have to pay for something like you do in this app. 2 Thing is the games. They seem like they dont really help you in what the app says they will do. Overall this app is pretty good.
5,fredfred2020,Amazing app! I had downloaded other similar apps and I ended up keeping only this one because it has everything all the other apps had in just one app. Fun app.
5,DesaraeNycole,"I LOVE this app, it‚Äôs so great and keeps the brain going and helps memory and brain function it‚Äôs been a big help for me in my daily activities and mental health I definitely recommend! Worth the buy!!"

5,princesssop,"Fun puzzles and quiz games that remind you to stimulate your brain during the day. Might not seem like that big of a deal, but it actually does help to reinvigorate your concentration."
1,HelloReviewReader,"I signed up for a free trial, which on its own is kind of a scam and hoping people forget they agreed to the autobill. But the free trial doesn‚Äôt even let you see the results of the test you took so what‚Äôs the point? I spent 10 minutes answering 72 questions about myself only to what‚Ä¶be forced to pay to get the results? Then how is it a free trial? And why didn‚Äôt they ask for the cost before I invested my time? The worst."
5,JenniMcCoy,Helps me to slow down and pay attention to the screen. Improved my memory and attention
5,Cheltzy Phillips,It‚Äôs hard to find time to complete enough healthy brain exercises. This only take a couple minutes and is fun! Totally worth it!
4,cheftot,"I enjoy the content on Impulse. However the price to use the app feels quite steep. 30 dollars for the year or a one time payment of 50 dollars. Seems equivalent to a console game, with less content to drive the time with play per pay."
5,GODZBESTCREATION,I find myself not being as sharp as I was in my younger years so this app helps to sharpen my brain. It may seem simple but what I get from this app allows me to put the small things into focus.
5,HeatherFüòÄ,This is definitely worth the purchase!
5,Okie Steve,"The challenges provided are mind and reaction stimulating and after all, FUN. Try this to help you improve what‚Äôs essential to survive in this world besides all the FUN technology out there robbing us of our time."
5,Shayami808,"If you have ADHD, just do it. This was an Impulsive (ha, get it?) buy late at night when I couldn‚Äôt shut my brain off and have found that it helps ground me in a fun and interactive way. So far, I love it."
5,trevinderr,It definitely helps me calm down if I‚Äôm stressing about something. It offers my brain a challenge when my day job doesn‚Äôt necessarily test my intellectual capabilities. 100% recommend!
5,Zen Jeff,"Impulse is easy to use, and the games give you the results you seek. I have used other apps similar to this, but none have yielded as significant results as Impulse!!"
5,The King 6099,"This is a great way to start your morning! If you are like me and need a little more than coffee before work , we‚Äôll then double down with this app !! Make it your daily impulse!"
5,MJM22!,I had to reinstall after deleting for a while. I was missing something and I found it once again. Thanks!
5,CheleeBean,I love doing the challenges right when I wake up to see how alert my brain is first thing in the morning. It‚Äôs a great way to wake up the mind and get it ready for the day!
5,Gempath,I have been playing a Hidden Objects game for several years now to keep my brain young.  This App will challenge me even further.  Looking forward to my daily sessions
5,Delvec1,"I don‚Äôt know the science behind it, but I know that I enjoy taking the time out of a busy schedule to let my brain do things it normally doesn‚Äôt have the opportunity to do."
5,Nothingbut100,"It doesn‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm working on memory or concentration. I feel like I‚Äôm playing games üòÇ but you do have to think, it‚Äôs not mindless which is refreshing!"
5,blueeyedblondie6432,So far this is my second day playing this cognitive game. I like it because if I play long enough my memory will improve as well as my motor skills and my decision making skills. So far so good!
5,Juan Esteban Cano,Awesome collection of brain games. I‚Äôm the morning it helps me turn on the brain and if I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping at night it also helps to calm me down until I pass out.
5,Loric0426,I am always working on ways to improve my memory and overall brain function Impulse is the perfect app to help me achieve goals.
5,S10ChckRR,"I absolutely love this app! It improves my overall memory recall capabilities and quick thinking skills. If you are a life-long learner like me, you will definitely appreciate what this app has to offer!"
3,Krysd88,"I love the app itself, but there are ads in between each game that generally last 15-20 seconds. There are so many positives to the app as a whole, but being inundated with ads (let alone the same exact ones over and over) is a major downfall."
3,coliunwwwwww,"I got this app bc I wanted to test my iq and even though it gave me the number, you had to pay for the full evaluation which is so annoying. I like doing the brain strengthening games daily, but there are also a lot of adds and it‚Äôs always trying to get me to pay for a subscription."
5,leeannp34,I find it best to play when everything is going on around me like today riding with my honey down the backroads music playing loud and trying to concentrate on the game is a whole different ball park
5,Noway777,"I originally found this game a few years ago and I loved it. So now, I have a little more time in my life so that I can enjoy it again. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to train your brain."
5,NabilS.,"I really like it because it feels like it actually challenges you and it‚Äôs super accurate, the interface is super smooth and the visuals are on POINT. Very impressed!"
5,Light Worker Swan,"So I freaking love this app. So far this app has helped me with my memory skills, my mathematical skills, it‚Äôs helped me to analyze the list literally is unending I highly suggest this app to anyone who wants to increase their IQ.  You‚Äôll thank me later      Yours Truly ~K.J. Pierce üíã"

5,NeptunesCompass,I like impulse because it keeps me from being bored. It has quizes you can take and lots of simple fun games to play. I definitely recomend it to people who find themselves bored often.
5,hkmb72,"It is only my second day of having Impulse, but I love it so far. I feel like this game gives me a chance to challenge my brain in different ways that I might not use normally. üëçüëç"
5,snshdghshd,I love how you set a challenge for yourself. It asks you questions at the start when you‚Äôre beginning and if you answer then it gives you the perfect question for you.
5,Smileyhead03,This apps allows you to really utilize your brain. I like the different games they have and different ways to use your brain to gain skills and to see what skills you already obtain.
5,NightPhotographer,This is my second go around on this game. I did really well the first time on most games. It challenges my memory and cognitive awareness. Wish there were more like this.
5,Shekey.Official,It gives me a chance to use my critical thinking. Also strengthening and conditioning the motor skills doesn‚Äôt hurt. I forget how much learning new things helps to change the way I think.
5,Arynkh,Th games gives you ratings on how you do compared to others who are your age and play the games. I know it‚Äôs not always good to compare and it might not be accurate but it is a great confidence builder.
5,Disposable heroine,"Instead of downloading a dozen word apps and tube games, just download this. It contains many games and doesn't have intrusive ads in the middle of your experience."
5,regnext,Impulse is a very enjoyable way to stimulate your mind at night or when waking up in the morning. The games you play test your mind In a very interesting and exciting way! Personally I give it a 10/10
5,TheDoubleOh,Fun games to keep mental activity going. You can set the amount of time you‚Äôd like to spend each day. There are also other features such as test to learn more about yourself.
4,celand555,"I have only used the game for two days so far, but I find it very interesting. I don‚Äôt think I have played it enough to see any improvements ,but I would like to continue to work on the games to see what happens."
5,thisappisbadnews,I have Post Concussion Syndrome & have to train my brain because I have daily headaches following the concussion.   This app has a wide variety of options. Keep interest & is fun.
5,Deelee B,Great abs I feel like you‚Äôre actually doing something productive with your cell phone time while waiting in line or something to keep your brain active during lunch breaks.
5,SashaC.,This is my first time using a brain workout app and I like this one so far. The games keep me interested and keep me focused. I like how I can set how many minutes I want to devote to brain games per day.
5,RosieDarazio,It‚Äôs fun and get my brain up and moving. The ads are really short so you don‚Äôt have to pay for extra stuff if you don‚Äôt want to and can still enjoy the app.
5,Fill warrel NOT REALLY,I use it now to help if I have a headache or if I just need to relax it‚Äôs a great way to take you mind off what‚Äôs going on and instead of doing nothing you are putting that brain to work. I love it thanks!!
5,Gigglez610,"I‚Äôm a very distracted person , it‚Äôs hard for me to see details on the basic day . This has help me to become aware of my surroundings and also learn new things about my mind and eyesight ."
5,cukie333,I have adhd pretty bad& it wasn‚Äôt even hard for me to remember to do the exercises here on impulse app‚Ä¶(if u have adhd you‚Äôll know what I mean) it‚Äôs like candy for the eyes& brain while helping improve certain troubling areas! Thank you Impulse!!üíêüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4,aja !,"The reason why i didnt give it a 6 is bc nothing is perfect. Anyways, im 13 and i have problems remembering things and im trying to get better for my exams coming up!! Its very fun and i like it soo much that i recommended to my friends! Keep up the great work you guys <3 :)"
5,Yourladyoffabulous,I‚Äôve enjoyed the thrill of having my brain get to exercise. It has different exercises so you don‚Äôt get stuck in one game. It changes every time depending on your progress.
5,Joynutt,"Yep, if your awake, this is a flip‚Äôn challenge!  Keep your brain working and ‚Äúplay‚Äù  without fear of feeling inept.  This has been fun and when I fail, I know I will do better next time.  No criticism from anybody but my own mind."
5,mrcoachking,"I stuge focusing on screens. With everything moving to screens, computers, tablets and phones, this app is helping me become more aware.  Also Bulding my attention span while using screen.  This helps me more productive!"
5,SassyazE,"It makes you concentrate strictly on you for those few mins it takes to do the quizzes, I instead of all the other things that come with daily life."
1,Coop_48,This app may cure a little boredom but this app is all about the money. There are so many ads and I mean like 4 within a minute of playing and that is not an exaggeration. You also can‚Äôt get the whole game without paying for it and I think that is very annoying. This game makes you learn more about how quickly you can skip an ad than anything else. Do not waste your time.
5,emy! :p,"this game is honestly so fun to play, the visualz r gr8, and most of all, not every little thing is only accessible thru premium. i was actually surprised by the amount of available gamez i could play 4 free [in a good way ofc] and itz very fun to do so! the visualz r also so nice to look at, as i said before. if i were to complain abt anything it‚Äôd be that there were 2 many adz. but sometimez they let ya exit early! still, there is a surplus amount of adz. but everything else is awesome!"
5,Shauna Kimble,"Impulse is an extremely fun brain game! It‚Äôs got interesting results and IQ, EQ, and personality tests. Seriously if you‚Äôre looking to know yourself better, build confidence in what you‚Äôre good at and strengthen weaker areas, this is the game for you too!"
5,Peterthesuperdogof the world,Too many commercials and they last too long and you can‚Äôt figure out how to get rid of them
5,iwear5hats,I‚Äôm glad I got this game. I‚Äôm 61 and I feel like I can‚Äôt concentrate the way I used to and this is a way for me to strengthen my mind in a simple easy way. I could do it anytime anywhere.
5,andddkim,"I look forward to the challenges, it feels good to have quick brain games throughout the day to focus on and take a break from the day to day functions"
5,Farrahmay,"When I started, I wasn‚Äôt too sure but then it became so fun and helpful. I do feel like my memories improving so I went ahead and bought the lifetime membership and I am so happy for it."
5,Skidz65,I really enjoy doing the activities on this app. It keeps me thinking in different areas. It also helps me to stay focused. This is the first time I‚Äôve kept up with a daily activity.
1,Crashfisticuffs,"What had such potential to be a method of relaxation and mental stimulation has turned into a major frustration. No one wants to sit through adds for fake games with some of which appearing to be cheap copies of popular arcade games.   I don‚Äôt mind suffering through a brief add that passes and I can back to what I was focused on, but when the add sits there waiting for your interaction and just keeps redirecting you to the App Store, no thanks."
5,wiwwin2016,Impulse is a great way to activate your mind.  After a stressful morning Impulse will send me a notification to do trading session so I sit down do the few test and it does help with slowing down and focusing.  It‚Äôs a great little break.
5,Music D'Animal,Love using this app to both kill time while waiting for my kids sports or to wind down at night.   Give me a challenge but not in a stressful way.  Easy to navigate.
5,Cheybbyxo,"Severely inattentive ADHD.   That comes with many struggles but attention and memory are the biggest for me. Although, I don‚Äôt find it healthy to be stuck in a game, I do realize the benefit of cognitive training.   Highly recommend."
5,OsoGoloso10,Just began using the app and it‚Äôs really fun and has a ton of different options and ways to work different areas of your brain. I really love it so fue keeps me entertained for hours!
5,DLSGbird,The games are fun and just hard enough to feel challenged as you get better at them. It‚Äôs easy to see your progress stats too.
5,adsbonilla,Brain Exercise that‚Äôs Fun and Fundamental. I don‚Äôt get a lot of breaks in life but this has truly been a pleasant one. I am enjoying the exercises. I feel like I‚Äôm playing games but it‚Äôs useful at the same time.
5,Another widow,This app is assisting me with getting my mind back while I‚Äôm dealing with grief for losing my husband.  I believe it‚Äôs helping me recover my memory and being able to move forward.
3,FlyAce 101,"Most things about this app work well and are entertaining at some level however,the one game called Pass The ball hasn‚Äôt worked for months and I can‚Äôt log a day of training because every single day‚Äôs training selection includes ‚Äúpass the ball.‚Äù"
5,RuralRenee,"I‚Äôve KNOWN that this sort of thing is something I should have been doing - but wasn‚Äôt. Now that I have Impulse, I can see how much it helps to give my brain a workout!"
5,Lysee24$!$,"I haven‚Äôt played many brain training apps, but I really like this one so far! The only thing I wish were different is to have fewer ads with the free version."
3,u2knowme,"Can‚Äôt really give a review been on it for 5 min free trail but I‚Äôm looking r for a app to get me detox from watching nonsense I‚Äôll update soon Update I found myself unable to stop myself, normally these types of apps bore me I get overwhelmed and quit. I enjoyed although not in my budget to keep. I‚Äôll be back"
2,Must everything be so difficult here?,"The game does not give me accurate stats. I am sorry that I spent money on this game. The games themselves are interesting, but it is discouraging at the end when you know it is not accurately tracking your progress nor how you compare to the competition. I have the most updated version, so I know that is not the issue."
5,Impulsive retraining,I find this app challenging but encouraging as well. I‚Äôve used other ones and just quit because the content does not adjust to your understanding. This one does‚Ä¶thanks guys!!
4,My so far reviews,"Well so far I really like impulse, and I think everyone should use this. Because I personally didn‚Äôt realize how slow my brain had gotten. But I think, am almost positive that this app will definitely help."
5,T2Joy,Entertaining and educational at the same time!   So nice not to deal with ads while doing this type of activity.
5,BPR mom,These exercise are simple and sweet. They help the brain to be the best it can be as I get older each day! I love this app and the quizzes it has as well as different levels to achieve.
5,EmiBalto,I‚Äôm a first time mom and spending a lot of time nursing my little one. This app helps me stay awake and train my brain when my little one is with me. Great way to exercise your brain. Works excellent on iOS.
5,Iammebrandy,Every thing about this game helps me move forward opens up my mind to all things . Helps with memory issues and relaxation my mind and stress levels Thank God for this app
5,Huckl18,! Only used it two days and it test every skill level of brain usage for normal person/daylife ! Definitely something to help build mental structure/strengths
5,LVKatester,This app has it all! Such a great variety of tests and puzzles that are fun and challenging at the same time. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting cognitive self improvement.
1,RajunCajun_48,"This game is trash, full of ads and begging you to make purchases. Had to click through 20 screens, then deny purchasing the game on two separate occasions before finally selecting a game that made me play through an ad to play a simple game that was literally 2 moves. Then the next level I had a whole other ad to sit through. Uninstalled before going any further. Just crapware junk"
5,JRDLT,I‚Äôve been using this for two days so far and I gotta say that the exercises are challenging in a way that facilitates growth. Definitely recommend to everyone!
1,dmfjejskc,I did one test that took time out of my day and I wanted to see the results. After the test it told me I needed to but the premium to be able to see the detailed description and that was after already shoving the other ways to spend money on this app down my throat. It takes every opportunity not missing one to try and get me to spend money.
5,Danie ChatterBox,I enjoy mental stimulation. It makes me think & feel like I‚Äôm alive and trying to keep my brain active. Once your brain starts slipping you will wish you used tools like this app. It‚Äôs awesome!
5,Ttammi,I enjoy that each game has its own type of puzzles and challenges. This game keeps you coming back each day to keep training your brain!
5,Leeeeaaah,I'm in love with this app. So far I've done multiple trainings and ive only gotten a total of 2 ads!!! I 100% recommend if your looking for a game to help improve the way you think! ‚ô°
5,designated listener,I was worried about being aware of cognitive decline so I started using Impulse as a daily way to test myself. I‚Äôm not much of a game person but these are brief and challenging enough for the most part.
4,Scarrrr‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,I love this game it helps me focus and learn more about myself like if i had adhd or not its cool i learned my IQ and it has games so you wont have so many games downloaded just open this game and its the one you want like connect the dots sort the balls etc
5,RileyRollin,Definitely love that when I have down time I don‚Äôt resort to scrolling on Facebook instead I get on this app and relax unwind and refocus my brain definitely a great coping skill if dealing with stress
5,grneyez1010,Great way to improve your memory‚Ä¶would probably do better if I wasn‚Äôt watching tv while playing. But shows multitasking is possible. Love the variety.
5,cgeremai,I paid for the lifetime subscription and I‚Äôm glad I did. I didn‚Äôt realize the upkeep I needed for my brain. Puzzles that I was so good at as a kid have drifted. Glad to be back on top of things. Hoping to not get Alzheimer‚Äôs (fingers crossed)!
5,maiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,It‚Äôs a amazing game to play for kids and adults and the discounts they give when u first get the game but I think they should let us see the results when we do the tests
5,Codover,So far I‚Äôve only used it for a few days and so far I really enjoy how it‚Äôs making me feel. My brain almost feels like it‚Äôs getting a work out and I‚Äôm feeling more confident.
5,partyslippers,"It‚Äôs great! My doctor recommended it. How fun, my doctor says I can play games every day. I am seeing improvement already."
5,N. Brockton,I get notifications each morning and I enjoy the few minutes I spend completing the daily brain exercises. Thank you!!
1,Ferparedes,"I purchased the app and really enjoyed it to the point I downloaded it to my daughter‚Äôs iPad. I am not enjoying it anymore as the intensity of the ads basically push you to pay extra for the ad free service and that to me is bad planning, I understand you need to make money but introducing ads in such an aggressive way later on is not going to help you."
5,Chitamra,I had a stroke and ruptured aneurysm two month ago.   I was very lucky to survive and that things were pretty good.   I just have gaps as I am speaking and forget.   I am using this to keep my brain active.
5,Just Dre,"The games are very fun, and I like how you get rewarded with different prizes when you win and I like the trophies, and it is something that I can see me doing every day for the rest of my life"
5,Contagiz Culture Media,"Just as it‚Äôs important to train your muscles and exercise the body, it‚Äôs just as important if not more important to train your brain as all things begin with a THOUGHT or some form of thinking. Thanks Impulse app üôåüèæüôèüèæ"
5,boy with 5 heads,What a fun game. I like to use it when I have a couple of minutes of down time or when I transition from physical activity to sitting at a computer. Helps me change my focus and it‚Äôs fun.
5,wgcbear,"I‚Äôm 65+ and this program on my phone is a convenient way to reassure me that my brain is healthy.  Given my other health concerns and medications, I feel better about my head!"
5,Mateos707,"I love this app it has a lot of good exercises for the brain and awareness as well as simple challenges that only make us better at focusing,math,awareness,and our timing I would recommend this app to anyone."
4,@ari.jj,"Impulse is a great brain training game, though games can be tough and frustrating, it still is fun.  If you‚Äôre competitive, like me, it‚Äôs very frustrating especially when it give you a percentage and it‚Äôs low. Other than that the game is great."
5,Hobswife,I‚Äôve just downloaded Impulse in the last couple of days. So far I am finding it really fun. The games are engaging and are look forward to playing these games everyday.
5,MuL_Litt,"I suffer from years of addiction and epilepsy, which has deteriorated my memory tremendously. So far the activities are easy but I‚Äôm hopeful with repetition and being challenged, I can improve my brain functioning!!"
5,mltillman96,"As someone with a severe brain injury I appreciate having things like this available. I‚Äôve just begun to use the app, but so far so good!  If my brain could only remind me to use it!"
1,Huntercherry,"The creator, GMRD Apps Limited is an Israeli company that's been in the news for developing spyware and surveillance technology. They've been linked to some pretty shady stuff, including selling their technology to authoritarian regimes. They're the creators of the infamous Pegasus spyware, which has been used to target journalists, activists, and political opponents. Sounds like a lovely bunch. Theyre getting rich off of your data and helping put us all in a virtual prison. You're welcome."
5,Puzzlesdktt,"Easy to play games, but always challenging and always leave room for improvement so you never feel you hit a wall."
5,Iamawesomeobviously,Not gonna lie it‚Äôs kinda desperate for you to buy the no adds pass it keeps telling you to buy No adds! It‚Äôs just sounds desperate but the game is really good and the games are fun I recommend this brain testing game!
1,Triple stringer,"The games are mediocre, I downloaded the app and started the trial membership. After using the app a few times, I got bored as the games were repetitive and not very stimulating. I was charged for 3 weeks because I didn‚Äôt cancel. My request for refund was denied even though I didn‚Äôt use the app during the 3 weeks. They charge 6.99$ per week! Outrageous for such a basic game."
5,IshDodo,Using this app for a week I felt the improvement in every way my brain was just overall sharper smarter and faster
3,Shelia macks,I enjoy the set up of the app and the tests themselves are so easy to work through and understand. You can‚Äôt get any of your reports back until you pay for them tho or get premium. It‚Äôs a great app but expect to spend money for abt everything.
5,Dboneil,This has had so much helping for my memory issues and focusing failures and so much fun to spend super sweet times every day. The very best way to have so much fun.
5,Dulciannaj,I actually enjoy doing my daily little brain teasers. I like that it makes you do a little bit of everything and they are not always super super easy.
5,Ashers MoBashers,"When work has been tough for me, I‚Äôve used this to stimulate my brain and feed myself little mental rewards, on a daily basis. It‚Äôs worth the buy for a year!"
5,JonMVera,This app is pretty cool gives your plenty of insights to strengths and weaknesses also let‚Äôs you get more in tune with yourself. I like it so far and I look forward to improving areas of my brain.
5,mel_48,I like the game due to it being multiple different types of games that can help you increase your speed and the way you learn and such.
4,Thanks!?!,"This game really entertains my brain and gives me challenging questions to get my brain going. This game is also very helpful in the summer because I forget sometimes so it helps a lot. This Is why your game helps the brain, Thank you!"
2,Angelgoncr8za,I only paid for this appt for this game as it‚Äôs my favorite but I already passed the levels so I keep having to replay the same levels I already passed.. now I‚Äôm regretting paying for this game.. I asked for a refund since I‚Äôm just replaying the same games cuz there is no more levels even though it says it‚Äôs working on it. I like that game to help with my anxiety
4,DragonBeard1061,Awesome way to train my brain. I‚Äôm noticing much more focused attention and my problem solving skills are becoming better as I‚Äôm able to resolve issues or situations without overthinking them. And the games are pretty fun too. One of the best 25 bucks I‚Äôve spent in a while!
5,dofrye,Are the game and way or hard.  The games are super easy to learn so you can stay playing immediately.  But the game itself is hard and is challenging.  I love that part.
4,JPC2021,"I like the games, sometimes the interface doesn‚Äôt work so well. Overall makes solve problems and keeps your brain active."
5,E. Balesteri,"I‚Äôve tried lots of brain training games, but find many boring. These exercises are fun and easy to understand. Straightforward, with a variety of options to strengthen lots of aspects of mental acuity."
5,iiiiiiiiiigggggkkwo,"Impulse has helped me sharpen my brain and attention skills, since I struggle with attention. I have learned a lot just from doing my lessons daily. I also have been getting better test scores."
4,BeddrvXxs,"This app is fun, and easy to understand for the most part. I was in one game that just kept going and going and I wasn‚Äôt sure when it would end so after 20 levels I just closed it.  I like seeing my progress."
5,KBrabham,I wanted some fun games to play to keep my brain sharp and work on my processing speed. This app has a variety of very fun games that increase in challenge. I highly recommend it!
5,TarHyungIsBae95z,I enjoy this app way more then I anticipated. The games and tasks are simple and fun. They remind me of the computer games I used to play at school during typing class. All in all an awesome app!
5,ihearthovercrafting,This helps my brain with quick memory which I feel has been hard after going through chemo.
5,rollingeyes113,This app is so cool I can‚Äôt get enough! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è but if you don‚Äôt have the money for the subscription the ads are so ridiculous and long it makes me delete it. Super annoying
5,Xwizardharry,"I love this game so much. It makes my brain work harder than ever and I would recommend this to any ages. It‚Äôs fun in general, but you also get some brain power in it as well. Download asap!!!!"
1,FrannaFS,"I set the notifications to remind me once a day at 5PM but I get bombarded with reminders and junk notifications every couple hours or so. It is distracting and annoying beyond belief. It seemed like a nice feature to be reminded once a day, but this is forcing me to turn the notifications off completely due to an overload of notifications. I guess this app will sit and burn in the background. Disappointing"
4,brandiallen310,I really enjoy the little challenges and tests they give you. You don‚Äôt think that it will be difficult but once you start a challenge and are on a time limit it makes it all the more challenging and fun.
5,Halloweenie888,The puzzles are good. There is a great variety. The extra games are nice bc they are just like other puzzle games I have on it phone without the ads. Glad I paid for a year subscription
5,GmaJuJu,"I love Impulse training.  When I do it more often or everyday I notice I‚Äôm able to focus more, make quicker decisions and stay more alert during the day.  My goal is to do it daily"
5,mmangel2015,"Love the different options they provide. Not just a bubble popping game or a , matching game . Seems there are tons of different options for training the Brain and they have a great schedule."
5,Gageemc,I have a really poor memory. As I‚Äôm aging it‚Äôs becoming increasingly apparent. These ‚Äúgames‚Äù are really challenging me to work with what I have and hopefully improve! Love the fact that it‚Äôs games but also brain exercise.
5,MadDeziner,I just started using Impulse. I‚Äôm performing better than I thought I would which has increased my confidence in my memory and recall. It‚Äôs a great app to improve and sharpen your memory and cognitive skills!
4,Unicorn4jaci,I got this app to keep my mind sharp. Also it‚Äôs a better way to pass time than some numbing game. This way you can keep your brain sharp.  It‚Äôs fun so far. I like that they have many different types of games to choose from.
5,Nixydix,I have so enjoyed the variety of challenges and how my brain is being judged to engage in different ways. I wake up looking forward to how I can beat my records. Such a great tool that doesn‚Äôt get boring.
5,Meg5227,I started this to exercise and challenge my brain but the games are actually fun. I love the variety and my goal was to do 5 minutes a day but I find myself on for over 30!
5,MrAllN1,"I often look for games that stimulates my brain, and Impulse is top tier. Although some games may seem simplistic, I do love how there is detail before the game that explains what the game is helping you to achieve. Thank you for this"
4,caaasso,"I‚Äôve only had it for 2 days but the games are fun, only reason I s not 5 stars is because of the ads they are frequent and back to back but not terrible due to them only being 5-10 seconds long"
5,BlackTheCool88,Some down sides are you do have to pay some money to get the full game and there are some glitches but it is a great app to play.
4,kimandoz,I sure wish they would make this free! The data and algorithms they receive from us playing is payment enough. I‚Äôm not going to pay for it because there are plenty of free games to keep my mind sharp
5,simging man,Wow! Didn‚Äôt realize how slow I am. It is eye-opening. Definitely a good to exercise my brain. I‚Äôm looking forward to her playing seeing some improvement over time.
5,Very concerned customer Claire,There could be less ads and add more exercises for people who don‚Äôt have the plan. Please because my parents won‚Äôt let me get the plan so I can really only play the gamesüò•. Have a good day!
5,King death knight,This is a nice break from some of the more complicated work throughout the day. And way better for not losing your whole day to than something mind numbing like tv.
5,fortnite master wohoo,This is a game that challenges your brain to move past it‚Äôs limits and stretch itself! It makes your brain think faster and work harder. Overall it‚Äôs just a really fun game!
5,HeyaBondaya,I just downloaded this yesterday so I can‚Äôt speak in experienced terms of this app but so far I love the idea and it‚Äôs helpfulness! It‚Äôs keeping me on my toes with the daily challenges and it even has tips on how to boost your mental and physical strength!
4,venusskyy,I feel if we watch all the ads we should be able to have stuff free instead of subscriptions. What if this helped someone who had absolutely no money and it kept them busy for a minute or two?
5,Astrid7940,I downloaded this to see how sharp my mind. The games are simple and quick. The app sends your reminders but not so many you get annoyed it has a great balance of fun and challenges.
3,Gutgg,"This is just a thought and I have no proof. But this app listed me as being in the 5 percentile of other users my age meaning 95 percent of my peers are better than me at the activities.  Now I‚Äôll say that I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was true, sadly haha, but I also was thinking it might be a ploy to get users to subscribe to the app. Listing a low percentile makes them feel they need to improve so they then buy the app.   Basically a modern con artist.   This is just a thought though and I have no proof.  Otherwise the games are fun but it sounds like other people have had trouble with these developers  so"
5,SMOFFKIN,I have really enjoyed the exercises in this app. I am not a gamer but these games or exercises are fun and challenging to someone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy playing games on my phone.
1,Mia and Sara,"I liked the training games at first. They became very repetitive after a year subscription. I decided to pay the 4.99 to get rid of the ads on the game I wanted to keep playing rather than pay another year. They took the money and kept playing ads. Ads, ads, ads! I emailed them and they‚Äôve done nothing to fix it! Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1,Macpalm9,"I‚Äôve taken plenty of self-discovery tests in the past, but I‚Äôve never had results that felt so far off from who I am. To make sure it wasn‚Äôt just a misunderstanding on my part, I tried similar tests on other sites and their results were much more accurate and aligned with what I typically see when taking these tests.   I‚Äôd honestly give it 0 stars if it was possible. üòî"
5,Rob_Ferre,Love this app and the variety of brain games. From math games to word games. It‚Äôs a great way to improve a skill set you‚Äôd like to improve. I have increased my mental math skills and have a good time doing it.
5,heretwoserve,"After using this for two days, I‚Äôve really enjoyed the brain practice. I‚Äôll keep trying it and update my review after more time with the app."
4,TunedInTappedInTurnedOn,"So on ‚Äúgames‚Äù, it gives an efficiency status against other players on levels 10 and 20 but stop after that. Why?"
5,808bossbabe,I enjoy this app a lot! I feel productive while I use it. It challenges your mind and keeps you fresh! It‚Äôs better than doom scrolling on social media that‚Äôs for sure ‚úÖ
5,Anon55556,I love it ü•∞ The app does an amazing job of keeping my brain sharp and introducing new fun games to play with and interact everyday. They‚Äôre simple but effective. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
5,Goodyneck,"I like the testing,especially the personality types and discussing with daughter who has the same apps. Helps us understand each other better."
5,z_files,The games are fun while still being productive and you don‚Äôt need to pay for everything which is a huge bonus
5,my hollywood walk,"Impulse is doing a great job motivating me. I‚Äôm doing great with the trainings. However, I know challenges to my impulses, reactions and timing are waiting for me! I‚Äôm looking forward to increasing my performance while enjoying the activities."
5,Bhilli22,Good app. Definitely helps with everyday brain function that I didn‚Äôt realize I was lacking in until i started using this app! 1000 percent recommended to everyone

3,jp1a,Ittakes for ever to start up Candy Sort and for ever for the last ball to go in?  This bug was somewhat fixed in the last update but back with a vengeance fir the latest update.  Let‚Äôs go back in time and release a fixed version.
5,redsands808,The training and exercises are helping with my attention to detail which has been affected by brain fog. My age and long COVID have affected my memory and retention. I appreciate the mind bending and problem solving exercises.
4,sabi464,I bought a subscription to play candy sort but it‚Äôs no longer working.  Customer service is great however and they reached out to get this resolved. Love the games and quizzes!
5,ELynnSalas,Tried this out and it was pretty good  had some games quizzes alittle bit of everything. Makes me want to get the full package . Good brain exercise game.
5,p-diggityehh,This game is amazing I have fun doing the training or games but helps you improve yourself so much and when you can‚Äôt train you can relax and play some mind training games
5,Paniolo Pete,"I‚Äôve been performing a couple of different Brain Game apps recently to keep myself engaged, mentally, since I have retired. I am enjoying Impulse quite a bit thus far."
5,GG Beliver,Fell hard acquired a concussion and my memory has been bad since so I thought this would be a way of helping to get back to some normality it is helping tremendously
5,egyptroyale,Improves my brain function which allows me to see my mistakes and correct them when accurately moving forward to new directions.
5,Owl Be Watching,"I love the challenges that are offered for free, it is improving my memory and keeping me alert. I want to keep my memory intact as long as I can and Impulse is helping me to do that! Thank you;)"
1,Paulsmom98,"I was really interested in this game. Downloaded it‚Ä¶. You have to pay for it! The entire application. It‚Äôs expensive also. I hope I didn‚Äôt agree to the terms, I can‚Äôt believe there is no free option. $6.99 a week (other payment options are available)! I feel like I was conned into downloading the game. Very disappointing. The application looked like it would be fun."
5,BBaez22,I haven‚Äôt been using this app long (2 days to be exact) BUT I really like the games. They are fun and I love all the quizzes that allow you to get to know yourself a bit more. Good job awesome app.
5,MrsGirouard,I have dyscalculia and I am very anxious when doing math. I feel like this is helping me and it feels good to see my immediate progress! I would say everyone would enjoy these games.
5,ultimate teapot,I really struggle waking up in the mornings. Give me coffee! I treat myself to a few Impulse games first thing before getting out of bed and it makes my next task a bit easier.
5,Hairstylist1183,"It‚Äôs fun, it feels like you‚Äôre playing a game. I‚Äôm 40 years old and I felt like my mind was starting to go a little bit by playing this game I feel like I‚Äôm stimulating my brain while having fun!"
5,jxcush,Some things are hard to prevent‚Ä¶ like our memory lapse that we don‚Äôt see coming.   This is a nice option with a great variation of tools to keep me on track.   Jxc
5,Vcns2,It‚Äôs better than being sucked into social media and is a nice little break from working. Helps to palette cleanse so I can go back to working feeling a bit refreshed.
5,tarko23,"I have only used it couple times‚Ä¶ its super fun, also to see ur results compared to other users is extremely exciting. We shall see how this experience continues."
1,C.Fred,"I tried the app after seeing a test in an ad. The test isn‚Äôt in the app.  So I took another test. Even with a free trial of unlimited (sic) pro access, it wouldn‚Äôt give me the result without paying for a subscription.  Based on this deceit, I will not use the app. I find myself wanting to report the app to my state‚Äôs attorney general for deceptive, bait-and-switch advertising."
2,basaltbetta,"im okay with paying a fee to have this app, but i have never seen an app that requires a membership AND has ads that pop up before and after every activity. the frenquency of these ads made me uninstall this app, i dont pay money to this app just for them to shove full screen ads in my face for more money."
4,Josephsha,"They put in the research and time to tell you how each game can help you. With time, your skills will increase. The only downside is that there are free versions of almost all of these games elsewhere."
5,Rickybfit,Just started using this app and I enjoy having it for when I have some free time or am on lunch break at work.
2,cricontrol,"The games and puzzles just repeat. It says over 200 puzzles but there are only about 3 different puzzles and they just repeat over and over. So bored doing the same challenges and puzzles. I‚Äôve played a lot of free games with more variety. The tests were fine but once you‚Äôve completed them, you have nothing new to do."
5,Boodillie,I enjoy this app but hate the ads. I went ahead and gave 5 stars since it‚Äôs not their fault I can‚Äôt afford to pay the subscription. They need to make money.
5,Dghcfhjvc,I‚Äôve only been using it for 2 days at this point but I can tell an improvement. I know it sounds crazy but I think this is worth it.
5,Vaylyne,"Lots of levels of a wide variety of tests, puzzles, and games. Appropriate for many ages groups. Daily tasks to help reach goals. I‚Äôve found everything fun and attainable, good boost :)"
5,NobleNatasha,It‚Äôs great to play with when you‚Äôre bored and increases your mentality. Keep yourself busy on down time when you have to wait and you‚Äôll gain benefits and patience as part of self love.
5,Mtg0verlord,It‚Äôs the free version so far and I‚Äôve just had an opportunity to see the problems for myself to focus more with. But still more to improve! Just wish it was free tbh.
5,penguin4282,I do puzzles for 30 minutes and at school I get only A+ because my brain is so sharp because of impulse thank you so very much for making impulse
5,Btbites,"I‚Äôm 61, and I‚Äôm loving this app. It‚Äôs helping me with not only my memory, by playing the game but, it‚Äôs also helped me with insight into how my brain works and my emotions and how I can do things to better myself."
5,TyB 1963,"I used Luminosity years ago and found it useful.  This is a fresh new approach to brain games and while I am only two days in, it seems like a great series of brain games.  Thanks!"
5,Maui229,I just started using the app but I‚Äôm loving every game it has picked out for me. I‚Äôm doing my daily challenges and they‚Äôre fun all the while it helps my brain. Best brain game app out right now!! Thank you Impulse!!!
5,Not A flyleaf fan,How is it that you play a game and then feel more focused?!? This game is it. I can do a quick warm up game and then I‚Äôm more focused throughout the day and a lot more productive since I‚Äôve been challenged!. I love this app!
5,Chiquigon,"Just started and love it. I have ADD and this I hope will help me focus, etc. great app!!!! Will work on it every day üëçüèª. I will get faster at games, didn‚Äôt realize how slow I have become"
5,Neb Cyclone,"Fun games, informative and detailed personal development quizzes. Also simple and engaging. This isn‚Äôt the bland sit and stare stuff that‚Äôs so common. Feels like you‚Äôre actually developing as you do the exercises."
5,issadeal,Impulse is a great game. It sharpens your mind and skills. I like that I can play mini games to pass the time when I‚Äôm bored or have a break at work or even a few minutes before bed.
5,Goldegirl88,"I've been playing Impulse for a few days now, and I'm really enjoying it! I'm excited to get on and do my daily tasks, and then challenge myself to do even more!"
3,Nm 99,What happened to the challenges? Was trying to hit 365 :-/. Would love if you only did 3 games for a challenge day and had ability to pick between 2 similar workouts.  Would also love more levels on games! Especially candy sort.
5,CynKinGa,"I have not been using this training for long, but I already feel sharper and quicker in my brain processing time. Also, the games a are a lot of fun!"
4,GiaChico,"I‚Äôm glad I found this game, it‚Äôs enjoyable and I feel like I‚Äôm really working my brain. The only reason for the 4 stars is because I got a 92% off discount, however, what I paid was not 92% off.. it was a little less then 50% off."
5,Orion Blake,I like this game Because it has many tests you can do to see certain things a out yourself. It also trains your brain and I find it effective. I can feel my brain cells flexing
5,Piecesofyou,I highly recommend not only am I learning a lot about myself I‚Äôm also training my mind 10/10 recommend !
5,Ghost Mane 304,This is one of the best games for all ages actually as long as they understand what they‚Äôre doing this game challenges you to make quick decisions and smart choices as well
5,J Stummy,I enjoy Impulse because it makes you think differently from our everyday activities. It‚Äôs self challenging and makes me want to do and be better.
5,Ella123456788960,"I downloaded Impulse as a joke after I saw an add on tic tok, but when actually saw the app it honestly surprised me. The tasks and games it provides are simple, fun and encourages strengthening the brain in a non stressful way. Truly a great app."
2,WaywardK99,"The cleverest thing about this app is how it convinces people it‚Äôs for their own benefit when the whole thing is built to take more and more of your money. Every little thing is an upsell. It‚Äôs a very well designed grift. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Everything in here is available free elsewhere. It‚Äôs all presented in a nice package, but it‚Äôs a shallow facade."
5,monjott,"I just started using this app ,mand so far it has been fun but easy. I am sure once I get more time in it under my belt, it will become more challenging. And who does‚Äôt like a good challenge?"
5,Yng Mimi,This app has helped me so much. As I‚Äôve been getting old I‚Äôve been struggling with my memory and looking for ways to keep my brain active. Such a fun way to meet my goals.
5,Kingkody777,Love it!! Don‚Äôt love having to pay but I got the 92% off so a year was 30 bucks not bad. Love the games makes me feel better about myself at the end of the day knowing I outperformed 99% of my age
5,Vnar1,"I really enjoy this app, the games although they seem simple is crazy to see how you can make mistakes and realise that you are not as sharp as you thought you are! Fun, entertaining and easy!"
5,wiskeypop,"I‚Äôve enjoyed playing the games while strengthening my brain. We always want to avoid our minds degrading, why not have fun in the process of keeping them strong."
5,this process is torture,I‚Äôm bipolar 2 and have PTSD from 21 years of Army service. Impulse gets my mind conditioned to be more present in my mindfulness practice helping me stay ahead of a trauma response that may adversely effect the people around me. It‚Äôs a great tool.
2,Anon7298200474,"App is really good and the games are fun- I don‚Äôt mind paying for it but the constant pay walls are really frustrating. You need to upgrade all the time and pay one time fees for things like test results. Pretty annoying.  Anyway, I deleted it after I saw an ad for a different app on this app after paying for the subscription. So I‚Äôm out."
5,smooithe,It makes me fell like my brain is getting really smarter and helping me out with the process of it it has made my life and brain easier and more accurate.  It also helps me with some things like school work and solving math problems and issues with it.  It takes me a lot of effort and time and most importantly a lot of explaining to tell how good this and how amazingly good this app really is if I‚Äôm being honest.  DOWNLOAD THIS APP  NOWWWWWW   It will help you a lot of times and savers
5,Streets hopper,This app is way more intriguing than I thought it would be.  It keeps me engaged and makes me want to come back for more. It youvhes on everything too
5,ahonaker44,"I was skeptical of this app working to strengthen my noggin but, I‚Äôm honestly surprised at my enthusiasm for it. It makes me feel good about myself, that I seem to be getting a better memory and hand eye coordination. 5+"
2,Willow is away,"Instagram ads prominently show off an ‚ÄúADHD type‚Äù quiz, however once downloading the app it is nowhere to be found. What‚Äôs more is that the so called free trial does not give you access to the full app. It still prompts you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to a weekly/yearly subscription to gain access to much of the app‚Äôs content. Disappointing to say the least"
5,neonjoy123,I love this game so much it it so fun I would recommend impulse so much!! It has so many games and thing that you can play and you can spend 5-15 minutes to play as your goal. It‚Äôs my favorite! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Chandra Lockley,I have been on disability for 9 years now and without the daily grind of working my skills have deteriorated rapidly. This is one of the best apps to work out with I have found.
5,Cella_K,In my older age I‚Äôve realized that keeping my brain active is incredibly important. I e actually been looking for brain exercises on a mobile device and found this app. It‚Äôs truly awesome.
5,Justy0,"I really enjoy this game so far. The ads are skip-able after only a few seconds for the free version which is nice, and all the games are fun but challenging!"
5,Wordgirl31,I like the fact that I am doing some thing other than watching TV I like to challenge myself and this gives me an opportunity to do that
4,Tikvah42,If this app didn‚Äôt cost nearly all of my disability paycheck each month I‚Äôd be all over training on it often. The games are fun and help you stay sharp while appearing to just be enjoying some games.   Too bad I can‚Äôt afford it üò¢
5,LarissaLynn3793,"Lots of fun, intriguing and challenging.   However I wish that there were more free options, though if you chose to pay for the subscription I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be easily satisfied."
5,qadrpartyof7,I‚Äôm only on day 2 but just that fact that I know I‚Äôm doing something with my spare time better for me than scrolling on social media I think is worth it.
5,rkfedwdedde,"This game is not only good for your brain, but it is fun to play aswell. This game has an equal amount of things to pick from if you get bored, and is great for sitting down and relaxing after work. 10/10 love this game!!!"
4,maya dewitt,"although it might seem like u have to pay to be able to do the fun brain training games, u dont always have to! at first i thought i wasnt going to be able to do anything worth my while until i realized that there was a ton of different games i could still play without paying! these various games are actually fun and help me use my brain to problem solve!! im so glad i found this app and hopefully after reading this u give it a try! i promise its worth it if u want to sharpen ur knowledge"
2,Zeelandgirl,It‚Äôs a great app but I can‚Äôt cancel my prescription. I contacted support and read everything and it says I can cancel in my Apple ID settings but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs harming my apple account as I removed my card and it keeps charging it so it‚Äôs an overcharge and eventually apple support will lock my apple account permanently. I can‚Äôt add a new payment method as it will simply charge it again.
5,wuckyduck,Finally a puzzle game that keeps my interest with the variety and skill level. Im also impressed that the creator is interested in feedback to keep the game at the highest quality.
5,ShuckyDuckie,"Been playing the app about to purchase yearly subscription usually don‚Äôt get into these kind of games, but loving the app and focus and never has been so much better 100% love it"
5,GeIIy,I‚Äôve suffered for some time with memory loss. I use this app to help me stay sharp & aware. This app offers great games to challenge your memory & how well you pick up on details.
5,Mr Neir,You exercise your muscles regularly. Why not do the same for your brain. I absolutely love this app! Instead of scrolling on social do something for your brain instead.
5,TinyTink76,I play this game with my grandson who is seven years old and he enjoys learning and using his mind a little bit better than what he would playing some silly game.
5,bettyswithbrains,Need a break from the daily stressors? Try this game! Impulse is a fun way to hit the reset button. I don‚Äôt usually (ever) play games on my phone (nor leave reviews) ‚Ä¶ yet here I am. That‚Äôs how much I love this game!!! Play it. It‚Äôs fun :)
5,falaykay123:,"I like these games because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting time playing them. I‚Äôm updating my brain, as well as recharging. The best times to play are the end of the day, or first thing in the morning."
5,IronicRonik,This app has helped me improve with my cognition. As well as problem solving quickly it helps improve your brain to understand situations quickly and solve it quicker ü•µ
5,brit022599,"It‚Äôs a fun way to pass time especially if you‚Äôre looking for a quick game to play. I have horrible long term memory so I‚Äôm hoping it will help with that, but the games are fun and interestingly challenging"
4,CandiChick86,"4/5 stars because of the fee‚Äôs associated with the unlocked version. But, it‚Äôs definitely a very entertaining way to pass the time away as well as train your brain! I recommend this to all ages!"
5,Bulletcoffeefan,I just got this app and I love it! I can spend the money amount of time or more if I want to and know that I‚Äôm improving my skills! Looking forward to seeing results in daily life.
5,Dobu2,There are a lot of brain training apps.  This one ranks as one of the best.  The training games are fun easy to learn with great tutorials. I have ADHD this app is great my micro short attention span  I would recommend this app to friends and family
5,Lea babe0,It helps keep my brain in check and I love to see all of the different games! The only thing is that I just don‚Äôt like that adds. but overall it‚Äôs a pretty decent game! <3
5,D-Reviewer,Love the games and puzzles but i have a thing against paying for apps that seem like games. Get it though and i‚Äôm glad you can still do some stuff without paying.
5,UwU I like to be sus,"I have ADHD and I struggle with math and other things! And stuff I‚Äôm normally horrible at, I‚Äôm AMAZING at it! It‚Äôs like I have a super power! To developer: I don‚Äôt know how you do this, but it‚Äôs amazing! It‚Äôs only my first day and I feel sharp! Great work!"
5,LAHunny,"I really like this app much more than I thought I would. It‚Äôs fun, mentally stimulating and there‚Äôs a variety of games. I would recommend this app to just about anyone, including teens."
5,alf630,After a couple of days following training you can realize the progress. Easy and entertaining
5,Ebeauc,I had a brain surgery. Afterwards I doubted my abilities. This app has helped me sooooo much!!! I can visually see improvements. I will never be able to thank the developers enough for the support
5,Pm08b,I like this app because it serves a good purpose. It helps me do something to help my mind instead on scrolling on social media.
3,James Clark Elam,I was playing this with my 5 year old cousin when I had to snatch the phone because of an add it wasn‚Äôt all of them but to have to look over my 5 year old cousin‚Äôs shoulder so he doesn‚Äôt see anything inappropriate on an app that is rated 4+ is not okay
5,Michaela_magcon_fangirl,I have been using this app anytime I get anxious and it does the trick! Highly recommend if anyone is struggling with anxiety attacks/panic attacks. Trying to calm a racing mind is hard but this app has worked for me!
5,KotaBugg47,Has a lot of different games - training tools to keep you interested and wanting to continue the next day.
5,Texasbeauty131313,"I just started playing these games, and the fact that I really like it does really help with exercising your brain‚Ä¶   Honestly, this one of apps that I actively enjoy and playing daily‚Ä¶"
5,TippyTippson,"I have only recently picked up doing this app but I find it to be, not stressing, easy to pick up and I believe it could help your mental strength! Definitely give it a try."
5,Kardzy,Build your brain while playing fun games. Choose this variety pack of challenging games instead of mindless slots. This has the whole package for focus and concentration.
4,rettamic,"I love playing the games, especially Candy Sort. Latest fix, though, messed up the undo button. Now it restarts the game instead of just undoing the last move. Please fix. Thx"
5,Boyohboytish,The ads are a bit frustrating but the activities are worth the time.
5,Reesacarr,I really do enjoy this app. It has helped my memory and it gives you something to do when you‚Äôre bored.  Try it you will like it!
5,Independent Contractor Gal,Love how this app helps me exercise my brain with entertaining little games I can play in my down time. It offers me a healthier alternative to scrawling through on social media feeds.
5,VegaLaRoux,"It‚Äôs difficult for me to focus on Sudoku long enough for it to matter. This brings in math skills that had fallen by the wayside. My concentration on patterns has markedly increased. Lastly, I thoroughly enjoy this game- why I keep coming back."
4,4actors1momager,I love the app. I like challenging my brain but lately the candy sport game is glitching. You can‚Äôt put the last 4 together no matter what you do but eventually they do count as completed but this needs to be fixed
4,Breezy7210,"I love the candy sort game, but there are now major delays when opening & finishing games. This what I do at the end of the day to unwind, and it‚Äôs super aggravating.  Hope these are fixed soon!"
5,Yolipoch,"I am enjoying this app, it is entertaining and keeps me away from meaningless scrolling while at the same time giving a workout to my brain."

5,Dayley99,I love this game! I have the free version and it‚Äôs helped exercise my mind in a way I‚Äôve never seen! Fun little games that don‚Äôt feel like school work! I would definitely recommend!
4,SenpaiMeow,It‚Äôs a pretty nice app and the presentation is really great. Simple and intuitive to use. I only wish the subscription could be shared with with my Family for my wife. Really wish there were some disclaimers about that part.
3,OaklandPrettyAvocado,I really realize I am starting to slightly overlook simple details. These brain training exercises definitely keep my eye brain and hand coordination back in sink. I notice a lot more details and it has helped me in day to day tasks be top of my game. But it‚Äôs fun and stimulates me to continue with the trainings.
5,omshesaid,I find I enjoy this app so much more than the other games I have downloaded cause I know it‚Äôs improving my brain skills!
4,CrissiKaye,I enjoy the challenge of the different games and brain activities in the Impulse app. It‚Äôs easy at times and difficult on other occasions but the challenge makes it fun to try and master the more difficult games.
5,Emari411,"Ever since I graduated I haven‚Äôt had much to do that stimulates my brain, but this app completely changed that. It‚Äôs really helpful to help sharpen your mind and keep you busy."

5,Bill659,"The puzzles and tests are timed, which I love.   Haven‚Äôt had to solve problems this fast since my Air Traffic Control days.   Feels good to feel the pressure again.  I guess that‚Äôs a good thing?"
5,"Another book, please!",I‚Äôve been looking for a way to keep my brain sharp as I notice that aging is taking a toll on my memory skills.  I just joined Impulse and I really like it.  Highly recommend it!
5,PlayerAV,The games are just the right amount of challenge so they are not stressful.  I also like that the games are quick!
5,Miaegan,"Definitely recommend getting the app, I have been doing less social media more things interactive for my thinking and this is a great app for that!"
5,Jbunnii,This is game is great training. I‚Äôve surprised myself so far on accuracies etc. Each day is different and it doesn‚Äôt get boring with the cycle. I recommend checking this out.
5,LizShem,I just turned 61 and I noticed my memory and brain slipping a little. I love these games and I look forward to playing them every day! They‚Äôre fun and I‚Äôm improving my brain health! A win-win.
5,Deb Zieno,I like the different games built within this app.  It helps keep my mind sharp and and works to build my memory with the different tasks.
5,Sparkle 2334,First off there‚Äôs a lot of options but most you have to pay for to play or get your test results.
5,Hjd19852kids,I have only used the app for a couple days but like the different games. I also like that it tells you about your personality type.
5,alee103,Been using the app for a little over 3 months and I really feel a difference in my ability to remember things and learn subjects a lot faster.
5,Only1_Kris10,"Hands down the best brain training app out there. I love all the different tests you can take & find out what personality type you are, your procrastination type & so much more!! Tons of great puzzles & games."
4,Mr.Greeneyes.,Went through all the steps and got to a pay wall so even though there was a 3 day trial $7 a week after that is a big ask. So unfortunately I was unable to enjoy or try your app.
5,Ashley79496,Impulse is probably one of the funest brain training games ever! I enjoy it a lot I highly recommend Impulse it's fun for kids and adults!! And most importantly my brain!!!! I really do think it's amazing!!
5,AlbyJ45,It has always been important to me to always exercise the brain and impulse is just the right tool for exercising the brain. I enjoy the app and I always love challenging myself.
1,Aubrey Dodd,"This app was fine for a few weeks - way too many ads but that was to be expected. Now every time I try to use the app I am bombarded by the same spam pop up over and over again. This pop up is not one of the in game ads, but a literal pop up that suddenly opens in my browser mid game saying to ‚Äúclaim my prize.‚Äù Absolutely obnoxious and not worth it."
5,-)Catnip(-,"I just started this app and I like it. I have difficulties with memory and concentration. This app teaches to focus. So far, it‚Äôs entertaining, as it gets harder I will struggle. I‚Äôd rather struggle than lose more of me."
5,Gffhbghc,Impulse is the best game because you get to challenge your brain. You can also learn if you need to do better at listening in class or to your parents!
5,Lil Ede,I like the way I can warm up first & I also like the percentage of how much higher or lower you are compared to our peers which is given at the end of each test.
5,Jowanabe,Fun way to train your brain on the daily‚Ä¶ just feels like games I would play to pass the time!!! If I‚Äôm gonna play games in my phone I definitely want them to help my mental acuity like this app!!!!
2,Dudlwbflshdpfh,"Before when I played this I just skipped the updates bc I was too lazy and then I decided to update it. BIG MISTAKE. Before, there were absolutely no ads and premium didn‚Äôt exist and now there are ads with everything I do and things like checking my test report is unavailable if you don‚Äôt have premium."
5,KOglesby60+,"For years I have struggled with some brain problems, with programs like this I receive ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù! My thought usage has expanded with this program, I enjoy the challenges, even the harder ones. If you want to expand your mind I suggest you join in and keep going! There are games you can play that can help your scores. But don‚Äôt be too concerned about the scores except to see that you will get better!  Have fun! üòÑ"

5,üíò‚ú®üåüüé∂,"They should add the attatchment styles test, but yea this app is great. You can take the tests as many times as you want, the games are fun!! They grow more challenging so really are learning and expanding! Totally would recommend"

5,kkemond,"It really does get more difficult.  No expectations, and enough variety to keep you playing even if you ‚Äúlose‚Äù one game."
3,MicahDeez,"The quality of the questions and the functionality of the app are professionally streamlined and tastefully assembled, there is no doubly about that. But to offer a ‚Äú3 day free trial‚Äù but still have all of the test results and personality archetype reports etc. hidden behind a pay just feels kinda ‚Äúcash-grabby.‚Äù"
5,Momma Alert,"I‚Äôm trying to train and challenge my brain, and this app does a great job in helping me do that. I‚Äôm also preparing for a big exam and these little brainy games is a great fun way to learn during down time moments"

5,Dimauro53,If you called this a test I wouldn‚Äôt even take a look at it ! But as a game I‚Äôm all in! I‚Äôm 70yrs old and I think I‚Äôll benefit from it. I know so many people With ALZ I think this will help keep the brain sharp.
5,ChiMom75,"My friends tell me that if it‚Äôs not complicated, it‚Äôs boring for me.  I find peace in challenges and chaos because I gravitate towards the eye of the storm.  I love how it relaxes my brain by challenging it.  I can go to my happy place here!!!"
5,i will love the 4 life,"Impulse is not only good for memory, problem solving, and quick thinking, but it also is entertaining everywhere and you can play without WI-FI"
5,mirmet131317,It‚Äôs a great app to add to something done daily. It‚Äôs easy enough to get through but gets more difficult depending where you are at and is worth a try.
4,Taylorwulf,"I wish I had access to the other games, I‚Äôm not sure about paying for the year in case I don‚Äôt use it however I know it‚Äôs great for my brain! Very enjoyable, each game is short and fun makes you want to learn"
5,Adpo22,Impulse is a helpful step-away from the day and really helps me to shift my mind for just a bit and take a healthy break. It feels as if my mind has been decluttered and helps to regain focus to fi ish off the day.
5,got uuuui,"It is the most mind-relieving game and stress relief that can occupy the time when you are all and will have a funny feeling, bad feeling, on an expected day feeling and it will take away all of that."
5,8131191213,I like impulse because my brain has been getting better there are some things that a  ok me people might not like but I like the app it‚Äôs also fun so I recommend it
5,Djavo,So far seems like a fun way to keep mentally sharp. Games are not odd nor does the app incessantly ask marketing type questions in between games.
5,ScariestList,I found this game as a sponsor add and decided to give it a shot. It definitely is fun and keeps you on your toes. I found it good to play between quick breaks at work.
4,JanaBanana1971,Cool app. At the beginning stages seems easy then  progressively gets more difficult.  Free trial has many advertisement's between each game it‚Äôs hard to say if I would like the app enough to purchase.
5,camzerker,I find this app very helpful to training the brain like you train your muscles. It‚Äôs fun and keeps you focused while increasing the way the mind thinks! Would definitely recommend.

5,Dk re,This is great for training your brain. Games are easy to play and learn. Play a game doesn‚Äôt take very long. Best is the limited game play per day so don‚Äôt get stuck playing games for hours.
1,tsz2fast,"Aug 2, 2022  I chose trial and this app developer charged me for a week. It is 6.99 for one week equaling 28 bucks a month! How this app is approved via the Apple store is unbelievable.  Regardless if this review is approved I don‚Äôt care because Apple and the app developer should know this price is a huge scam for what is offered. 28 bucks for NOTHING! I put a claim in for a refund as I chose trial as I do for all apps and then suddenly ‚Äúpoof‚Äù. The trial disappeared on their end. Hmmm"
5,Puiu33,I play 10-15 minutes before going to bed and I noticed improved brain stamina after few days. I believe the app is pretty well organized and fun too.
5,afreyoux,So much better to spend time on this than some other meaningless game that doesn't challenge your brain. Great game to get your kids brain working in a fun way!
5,fjdjdkfj,I love this game cause not only is it fun but it is also good for exercising your brain the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the ads maybe if they gave you a warning before the ad that be awesome
5,Gsmart93,It‚Äôs pretty dope I‚Äôm a little rusty but the challenges are helping me break outta that fairly quickly especially since I‚Äôm down due to injury. Something I‚Äôve should‚Äôve discovered along time ago.
4,k@ylync,I found this game on an add for a game that I never really played but as soon as I saw this I new that if I switched to playing this my life would be a whole lot more fun and I was right this game is so fun and it says will improve your memory so it is a win win.
5,Trofee aka Fee,"This game is absolutely incredible it‚Äôs more than fun it‚Äôs challenging, and creative I cannot get enough of this, I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone no discrimination in regard to age heck and if its productive then why not!üòÉ"
5,SylverStarduster,"So I thought this was going to be boring, but NOOO!! I was wrong! I play in the morning with a cup of coffee & it gets my brain moving!! These little games, really help with my memory. You should try it too!! üëçüèº"
5,aesthetic_brain,"This game is about challenging your brain, but in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel boring and intense like some IQ tests. I don‚Äôt really like committing to apps for streaks, but this one would be one that I would gladly do."
5,Suburbia livin,I purchased this on a whim and I am not disappointed. There are a lot of games and tests to keep you occupied and help the brain. I definitely recommend!
5,Mrs P Arballo,I like the different types of activities offered keeps your brain working quickly and helps with memory
5,Lmorin1982,This is a fun way to use mindless moments when I might have scrolled the internet. I can feel my brain firing‚Äî same little hit as exercise. Easy and intuitive!
5,DG82.,"Video games are usually a big distraction, however, impulse feels like I am doing something positive and healthy and while fun, I can stop and get on with my tasks. Thank you impulse!"
5,BooptheNose27,"It has many hints and games to try, wide variety, you can also do many things without a subscription too"
5,FeedTheDogg,"Not only are the games fun, and the puzzles challenging, but it‚Äôs a great resource to be able to take all the tests that you usually have to search all over the web for! Great app"
3,Igrok3891,"I‚Äôve been charged but still having all adds in between , also it keep asking me if I want to sign in for free trial and not showing anywhere on the app that I have any membership, while I was charged full payment."
5,Fineasachild,It seems to focus my thinking when I am playing the parts ‚Ä¶still don‚Äôt like working with numbers ugh!!!
5,Shondres,"These games are awesome for older people like myself. They are so helpful. You are having so much fun, you forget they are actually helping you with your cognitive abilities."
5,ChillManic,Impulse is a truly amazing app! It challenges and pushes me to be better and do better. I really like the progress tracking and stats it provides as well! Thank you for such an amazing app!
1,Peachyhiker,The ad I followed didn‚Äôt mention an app. I had already tried this app and found it unhelpful and not even entertaining. I am trying to cancel and BE WARNED that they made it as difficult as possible. I‚Äôm going to my credit card to put a stop on this app because my attempts to stop them have been ignored. As a retiree in this economy this waste of money is the last thing I need.
5,BESprouts,"I haven‚Äôt played this game for long, but what I‚Äôve experienced so far is exciting and challenging. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to keep their brain sharp."
3,sabou2.0,"Why would a good designer releases a new version in which the newly-added Restart button is on the same spot as the Undo button in previous versions???? Also, the Contact Us form on their website is a joke!"
5,SCM678,I downloaded this for the tests but love the games and all the insights that it‚Äôs been giving me! Hope to continue with this and keep my brain in check!
5,Taloolaz420,"this app has been a huge help for my brain. i got the lifetime subscription for only $42 something. i have only one question, when i first started i only wanted to train for 10 minutes but i want to change it go longer but can find how to do that. it not in the settings and i can click on streaks to pull it up and when i check my progress its not there either"
5,Roacho80,"I‚Äôve tried several different apps and Impulse is at the top. The training is great, easy to understand while challenging. Very user friendly!"
1,Me2bRIPOFF,This app requires a payment and bypasses the free trial period. It will charge a one year subscription instead of the 7 day free trial when you try to view test results. Then the test results do NOT reveal the promised answer. For instance - the Childhood trauma test does NOT tell you what TYPE of trauma you are dealing with. It just shows you a ton of non-sensical measurements which mean absolutely nothing to the user.
5,Harvalard,"Even though I do other games to keep my mind sharp, impulse is the most efficient and makes me feel better."
1,Pete5651288,"I signed up for the Impulse-Brain Training app, under the impression that I had a 3 day free trial. Then, a ‚Äúchoose the gift‚Äù game appeared that I could not advance past. I selected a ‚Äúgift‚Äù but it triggered a year long subscription to the app for $30. I‚Äôm unhappy about this, and feel manipulated into purchasing a subscription that I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted. I would like a refund."
5,clownbubbles,"Protecting your mental health is important. I just started this activity and I‚Äôm really excited to see how it works, but I really love it so far because I know I‚Äôm doing something for me."
5,Tavatar6,I like that it has a system for tracking your daily progress. The games are fun and get more difficult the more you play them.
5,Randallclan,"This app not only supports relaxation it also enhances  memory!  It‚Äôs nice to unwind, playing these games, knowing that you‚Äôre not only supporting your cognitive abilities, but also relaxing the noggin! Great app will definitely renew! üëçüëç"
5,marketlimit,"The app is user friendly, easy to navigate, and intuitive.  The exercises are mostly self explanatory and fun.  Great way to keep your mind sharp for years to come."
5,Raquel Realivasquez,Honestly feel smarter since using this app. Instead of scrolling endlessly on social media I‚Äôve adapted to doing these tasks daily. Very useful in the long run. Memory motivation.
5,Neural newbie,Tons of fun laughing at myself while training and improving my brain. The games are fun and easy to utilize! I am setting personal goals and celebrating my sucesses along the way!
1,Tacokilllllll,i understand the app needs to survive but these tests should be more accessible cost wise. its unfair to hold the key over someones head and say that this explain many factors of how you interact in the world and make them PAY so much for them. this app is kinda messed up and sad that companies will do this for a buck‚Ä¶ also like im not sure on the accuracy of these tests and could not be correct.
5,Mariano408,"I've had a good experience so far. It initially seemed easy, but now it's becoming a bit challenging. I feel much less guilty using this app compared to mindless apps."
5,Sunil Javali,I wanted to solve puzzle to improve my brain activity and I stumbled across impulse. I started loving impulse from the day 1. Everyday the complexity increases and trains you to think outside the box.
5,PLWILL999,Love the different brain exercises and truly feel the difference after playing these games vs. other apps ‚Äúfun‚Äù games.  This has a different element of gameplay which I enjoy.
5,myIQis149,"The app gives me a nice prompted set of exercises each day, and helps me see where I stand mentally, even compared to others, and learn about what I should focus on to sharpen my mind."
5,Fffffffcfffffssv,I‚Äôm just getting started so I cannot speak of any miraculous changes.  I can say that the exercises that I have participated in have made me think to some degree.
1,Limbonext,"The Candy Sort game doesn‚Äôt always fully register that you‚Äôve completed a level.  If you solve a level, it will unlock the next one.  But when you exit the game and then return, it often asks you to redo some of the levels you‚Äôve already solved.  I do have screenshots to prove dozens of occurrences, but the developer doesn‚Äôt seem interested in fixing it."
5,netofast,The most amazing part of this application is that it goes so intuitive and gives you the ability to rewire the brain having fun.
4,Jupiter D. Jack,I love this app! Why can't I sign in from my apple account? Everytime I try to sign in it doesn't do anything and after multiple attempts the sign in love notif glitches and won't sign me in. What's the deal here?
5,Gmema2u,"I downloaded the App only 1 day ago. So far, I have played approximately 6 different games. I love each game! I am excited to explore more of the brain improvement exercises."
5,LJW-20,I just got introduced to Impulse yesterday and I have been going through the different activities. This tool is a great way to work my brain and have fun too.

5,Brainy Bonnie,"Put an amazing way to exercise your brain and have that feeling of accomplishment afterwards! Feel like you‚Äôve lost your edge, find out!"
5,ChooseLoveMusic,I was looking for a way to increase my quality of life neurologically but also do it in a fun way. Impulse is really the perfect combo for just that! I highly recommend üß†üôå
5,JenWigKel,A much better way to spend 5-10 then scrolling social media. Enjoying all the games and seeing my results
5,wergakahabe,"So far this app is challenging me to go the extra mile to carefully think. Love the design, questions they ask you if you are ok. Will recommend to all my friends"
5,Kia Marie 74,"I never had gotten into these kinds of games but the games I love so many different to choose and I have noticed that my mind is more sharp and it relieves my stress , Relaxes me and keeps my mind focused"
5,ElderlyEagle,I love this game.  It helps me to focus and improve my memory skills.  I need something like this at my age and stage in life.  It only takes a few minutes a day.

5,Dopecitykid,Quite often at work I sneak away for a BM and I must say Impulse is a really great way to kill the time. Not only do I get away from my cheap cologne drenched satan of a boss but I get to make my brain healthy! Thanks Impulse!
5,Rnshopper,I‚Äôve only had it 2 days but love the levels of activity and different areas the app works on as well as the detailed summary of each activity.

5,ALMFOTO,Simple and fun games to keep you sharp and focused.  IQ tests and other interesting activities help you learn more about your brain and why you think the way you do.
5,H_ZooMom,"I‚Äôm so glad I gave impulse a chance. It‚Äôs help keep me relaxed, less anxious, and challenges my brain to stay sharp. If you are on the fence just do it! I highly recommend."
5,Roeno!,I like the different focus areas of this app.  It keeps your mind sharp and offers a wide array of activities that you can do.  There is something for everyone.
4,Saturn/Marissa,"This app is great and gives you easy challenges for your brain. However it does have a lot of ads, more than other learning apps like duolingo."
5,Jen dong loks,I love to have much mind play these games I am naturally a puzzle solver these game‚Äôs definitely keep my brain focused on one thing and a finish line I can cross and get to know my brain better
5,arojas8791,My mind feels more relaxed and alert at the same time after a few minutes playing. Plus I love the games! Most are super entertaining.

5,Cici0090,They‚Äôre fun puzzles that increase in difficulty as you show your skill level. It‚Äôs lots of different options besides my daily puzzles. Overall it‚Äôs just relaxing.
5,BacardyT,"Super fun test, games, puzzles.  Progressively gets harder and harder instead of just changing patterns at same difficulty.   Great way to work your brain instead of scrolling on social media."
5,Tealbirddish,A good way to pass some time on your phone while actually improving your brain function!
1,Tyreitz,"This app has so many paywalls behind it and the personality test and really everything in the app is so poorly done. The amount of typos in this app are comical. When being asked questions with two options for answer, they do not relate to each other in any way OR they mean the same thing lol. I don‚Äôt know who is paying for this or rating it highly but it‚Äôs terrible"
5,Levies 4u,I think it‚Äôs excellent to play very interesting. I‚Äôve always wondered what I could do to help keep my brain sharp found it.
1,nrbryant1956,"This app is setup to push for subscription repeatedly‚Ä¶ every game you try, every level you achieve, every interest you indicate leads to another ‚Äúspecial offer‚Äù for repeating payments.  Once you accept a free trial, you will not be able to cancel without being charged.    And by the way, their ‚ÄúIQ‚Äù test is not a useful measure of intelligence all by itself‚Ä¶ not at all.  This app needs work‚Ä¶ and boundaries."
5,kimmeebeegee,I find this to be a super way to spend an extra five minutes instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media.
1,bigjim_,"The hardest puzzle might be making sure you don't click the wrong place and end up with a yearly subscription. The games seem ok, but it just feels kinda slimy. You just finished your first three games, here's a great deal that's the exact same deal you just offered for a yearly subscription on the previous subscription screen. How's that for memory?"
5,Hygiene69,I just downloaded on day two but it‚Äôs such a great game!!! I love that you have the option to play other games not just the one‚Äôs assigned to you that day! So far the games are all enjoyable!
5,crefreshed,"I love the quick easy games. I already have tons on my plate and not much room for self improvement. However, this app makes it soooo doable."
1,lilleemomo,"I just downloaded this app and signed up for the free-trial. Oddly enough, I was still unable to access some of the features of the app. I couldn‚Äôt review reports of tests I had taken without being charged for the membership I was supposedly trying out. Very disappointing, I may a have continued the subscription had I been able to fully experience the app through the trial."
5,pharmmom0108,I have adhd and this game is wonderful. I enjoy that it has multiple different types of games and changes daily. The side games are also engaging enough to play and not get bored.
1,slaybaguette,its a good app ig like it was fun for the six minutes i played but like the first thing that shows up is paying for the app and i didnt want to so i hit the X and then when i got to the candy thing and ads started coming up like i thought this app was supposed to be about working on your focus but i cant focus when there is a ad at the bottom of my screen so the  i deleted the app.
3,GCZach182,I like the games but for the price I paid I am disappointed in how many times I have updated the app and there has been no increase in the amount of levels to the candy sort game. All game levels should be increased every time you update the app.
5,JMiller1602,This app helps me calm down when I‚Äôm having stress or anxiety. It can be really coming to just play the games and zone out for a minute. It also helps with memory retention.
5,Erol Z,I love starting this in the beginning of the day to wake up my brain and I love using impulse at the end of my day to help me wind down. It‚Äôs a great app to use instead of watching TV
4,DonHiser,"For some reason I cannot cancel the subscription for this app in my phone settings, but do not want a subscription.  Can you shut down my account so I do not keep getting charged?"
5,tibergioyifecitdiy,I personally enjoy the mind games because they do indeed help with the brain and to better understand your brain power much recommend
4,Makenna Robbins,I love the impulse app because it gives me a good time to do some things and it helps me relax! I just want ALL of y‚Äôall out there to get the impulse app so you won‚Äôt have to worry anymore just get the impulse app!! It gives you A LOT of relaxation!!
5,Gojo's lower half,I enjoy all of the different types of games they have!! Theres such a wide variety that all challenge your brain and i could spend hours playing it!!!
5,big tech needs to die,This is the brain game app I have been missing and looking for. Don‚Äôt even think about not getting it just go back to the top of the page and download now!
5,random15139,"I‚Äôve had this app for a few months and it‚Äôs honestly great, the brain training games r fun and it doesn‚Äôt take up too much time. Lots of fun tests to take like the personality quiz."
5,Double gawk gawk,"I‚Äôve been playing for about 6 months now and I‚Äôve got to say , this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played , the layout and everything just feels great!"
5,Munoz185,I can tell by doing a few games that I will Improve my focus and memory.
1,ynddhuwn123,"THE WOEST APP I try so hard to cancel the subscription that I mistakenly got. But this company really just want to use our money. So it cannot cancel in its APP. Also, when I write in there support the message cannot be sent. It is said like that. So that it is really difficult for people to cancel. And even in their website they gave us a fake link to contact itunes. What kind of company it is....."
5,Spirit 89,It‚Äôs challenging.  Tricky in a way. I like the interesting ‚Äútest ‚Äú changes. I also like the sound it makes when scoring my choices. Last but not least it‚Äôs fun and makes me smile.
5,rev_neumamm,"Keeps me from mindlessly scrolling social media, instead of Instagram I‚Äôll play 5 mins of games and feel like I have my brain a little workout."
5,planetc64,"So far this app is just what i was hoping for, fun brain training. Many, many games, learning a lot, very high quality. I will probably purchase after my 3 day trial"
5,taylorswiftgirl22989,I downloaded this game to help me have fun on my phone and think at the same time. I love playing games to test my brain power. I love this game very much. I hope this helps y‚Äôall greatly!
5,Cndo7,This app is so much fun‚ùóÔ∏èI had brain surgery which left me sleepy most of the time. When I interact with this app I wake up. Some of the activities resemble the testing doctors have given me. Thank you for this app.
5,NAR1109,I like that these games not only stimulate different areas of your brain and working memory but that they also show you how to improve
5,Reserie,Good game to help you keep your brain active especially if you have a job that doesn‚Äôt challenge your brain in all aspects . Highly recommend
5,Taru :3,Impulse is pretty neat the more I use it. It‚Äôs brain games that I miss being able to play to work my brain. Would recommend downloading it and see what you think.
5,Qafui,I‚Äôve download a few freemium games and apps before impulse. I was skeptical at first but it really puts to shame all those ad-driven alternatives. I went premium and it‚Äôs been all I need.
4,NL63,"The idea of playing something helpful to your brain health appealed to me and this app delivered enough challenge to make me think without being overly difficult. The only issue I have was the price is beyond my means. I enjoyed the free trial, worth trying!"
5,jet614,These games have helped me stay encouraged and sharp. I really like the challenge of achieving new levels. It shows how your brain is getting better at the various skills.
5,LoveYouRekha123,"Recommending for step by step process of boosting brain abilities for those who have never worked cause of any other reason,this will help you go ahead..go for it"
4,warlock's,"It‚Äôs fun and easy but there are limited games because of the subscription that has to be paid to be able to access all the games and just the overall experience. Otherwise, great game!"
5,Kimmy_Kat,I just started this game and it‚Äôs worth every penny an more. So far I‚Äôve learned what my strengths an weakness‚Äùes are and ideas on self improvement. Absolutely best game that I‚Äôve played in years!! Keeps you alert and sharp.  GET THIS APP NOW.
5,Icestees,"Hi, I‚Äôm a big fan of candy sort game, my question is, are the new levels designed to be only solved by adding a tube or am I not just solving it the right way? Thanks"
5,BoomCrazy,Impulse is fun‚Ä¶and frustrating in the best possible way. Only suggestion - make a confidence booster test that you always score super high on after scoring so low on everything else! ü§£
4,97392827,This app is super fun with the games. The games can be stressful but that‚Äôs the point. I think that‚Äôs the point because it makes my brain work harder and when/if I complete the game I feel accomplished and like I did something really good.
4,Audio1420,I just started playing and it‚Äôs very relaxing and challenging and it‚Äôs definitely good food for your mind‚Ä¶. I might be overstepping giving it four stars but that‚Äôs how I feel right now and on Monday number two I‚Äôve been playing  it so like I saidüòÅSO FAR SO GOOD!
5,Sakindele,I can feel myself getting smarter! Great workout for your brain. Feel I reactivated a feel cells üòä. I set myself achievable daily goals but planning to aim higher and workout twice a day! Great app!
5,Jenniluckygirl77777,I tried this because I have MS and my cognition can get really fuzzy with mostly short term memory. I‚Äôve just started using it but I think it might help me. I can update later

5,boraskz,It helps train my brain and reminds me that my brain is actually still smart and fast working. My second day so there‚Äôs still a long way to go
1,ToRi E g,"This app charged me two times for one month subscription that I forgot to cancel before it charged me, but now it charged me TWO TIMES PLUS TAX. I am beyond annoyed right now with no way to get my money back. Ridiculous. Want to help with peoples mental health but also wanna charge them for all of their money. Praying to get my money back because I‚Äôm in these hard times right now‚Ä¶ and every cent I need.. stupid app!!!!"
5,Kim Tru,"I‚Äôm enjoying this, working my brain in different ways. I‚Äôve started a habit of doing them in the morning bc doing these helps get me revved fit the morning."

5,Saddomm1133,"I just started playing these games 2 days ago. The main reason I downloaded the app is because I seen it helps with you going to sleep. And let me tell you, it ACTUALLY HELPSSSSSS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è I LOVE IT"

5,JoJoJodster,I love this program! I have slight short term memory loss from a car accident a while back and this program is getting my brain to work.
5,Nakia10,I‚Äôve been using Impulse for a few days now and the brain games are really helping me feel smarter. I look forward to the more challenging levels.
5,Legand 63,I thing the app is very useful and fun to kill time I‚Äôm in college and edit videos but sometimes i get bored or frustrated and this helps kill time at times overall its really good
5,Lin4999,This is actually a lot of fun and it‚Äôs quick! Easy to take less than 3 minutes to help your brain!! Highly Recommended.
5,D1205!,"Man, I truly enjoy this here application. I could get sucked in and not even feel guilty. Training my mind in such an entertaining fashion is definitely one of the coolest things to happen for me today."
1,AquaDragon911,"Like many other people, I tried unsubscribing from the app before my 24 hour trial period was up. This is impossible in app, and the app does not provide you with any instructions on how to cancel further payment! I found out that it‚Äôs been charging me for months even after deleting the app‚Ä¶only because a different app had redirected me to my iTunes subscriptions page to cancel a separate subscription. It‚Äôs a trap. Stay away."
5,desertsquirrel72,"I am so glad I found this app. I am using to accomplish two things, stop doom scrolling and work in coping with adhd. I also want to keep my brain healthy as I get older. Love this app."
5,Donna2362,I enjoy playing the memory games it helps me with remembering things. I suffer from short term memory loss and find the game helps me feel good when I get it right
5,sm0oth223,It really helps sharpen and fine tune a bunch of day to day skills that you don‚Äôt even realize most of the time that your using‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend to anyone ‚Ä¶
5,ncdfjvdd,I‚Äôm on the trial right now and I‚Äôm enjoying it very much. I love the different variety and it makes you use your brain.  I also love how it tracks your progress.
5,NNB10,Really good compare to other apps similar to it. Definitely asks all the necessary questions and help you to begin to process to train and exercise brain.
5,DaddiesGoodGirl,This game is highly addicting and the games are pretty fun. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the point you have to pay for a membership to keep playing
4,Sssshshshshshshshshakhriwbdoe,It‚Äôs not too hard for me but when I get things wrong I feel bad. I could spend all day on this app bc it‚Äôs stimulating but not too stimulating for my brain to process:3 Recommend to y‚Äôall‚Äôs especially you neurodivergent besties
5,Gabriellasuperninja,Wow! It‚Äôs already been just a couple of days and I‚Äôve learned so much. I believe my patience has significantly improved with the tasks provided to me in this app. I am truly grateful!
5,jackspiccini,I understand a little more how my brain works and I feel is a good way to spend time in the phone‚Ä¶ training your brain
1,Mattturner416,They gave me a 3 day free trial which turns into a paid subscription after if you don‚Äôt cancel (normal). But I wasted my time taking a whole test just to find out that the free trial will not let me access the results unless I start paying now. This is disgustingly shady & even if I liked the app I would never pay a dime to a business with such deceptive practices.
1,Skylaninc,Immediately canceled when I saw they wanted practically $28 a month. Absolutely wild.   Don‚Äôt hit me with that ‚Äúbundle for a year‚Äù stuff either because I still ain‚Äôt paying for that discounted yearly fee.   $6.99 a week or even a fraction of that isn‚Äôt worth playing some mini games under the questionable pretense that it‚Äôll improve memory among other things.
5,Fish breathe,Train your brian. I‚Äôm busy all the time too but I always make time for myself. I‚Äôm also trying to get better aren‚Äôt you? Here is a good start.
5,THERESAMCHASE,"This app has really helped my speed, concentration and consistency. I love these exercises and it really helps me in my everyday activities. I will continue to train my brain with Impulse!"
4,Arsl.,I like the games and it‚Äôs stimulating and it allows you to take tests but you have to pay in order to see the results. You can also pay to remove ads
3,whyvonne,"There are issues with Candy sort in the app, but the form to contact the developer on their website is not working either, lol!  Overall impulse is great, but the communication issues and bugs need to be fixed."
5,gfybdjgejjvdtjvruivfg,this doesn‚Äôt even need an explanation just try it i think i have adhd but im not diagnosed but i DI have ocd and oh my LORD‚Ä¶. i love this so much. it has such good exercises that challenge my brain and work it but not too much obviously. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
5,cambamdavis,I love this game and it is perfect because I have been looking for a game like this. You succeeded to bring me joy in this game I have 4 games on my iPad but if I deleted any of them this would NOT be the one!
5,EclipseTheKing1,Duolingo is talking about Spanish or vanish but impulse talks about helping others. and that‚Äôs not often shown for free but you can play impulse for free or not  Best app installed worth the storage
5,LeahMc00,I almost never buy apps. I‚Äôve maybe bought 2 or 3 in my entire life. This one hooked me though and so far I don‚Äôt regret it. The games are quick and fun.
5,paedave,I have enjoyed playing the games and learning how to use more of my brain. Also to find my weakness and strengths. Thank you so much for sharing this.
5,JJewell13,"I like the various challenges and brain exercises offered in this app. To me, it is a much better way to exercise my mind and time than scrolling on social media."
4,Candle82738182,I‚Äôve only just started using this app and I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself and can tell my attention span and memory is getting much better. These bite- sized fun games have helped my brain become much stronger
5,crystalr01,The games will keep you engaged and looking forward to the next day's session. I like that you can see your score compared to other users. Great app!
4,Likee is horrible,I‚Äôm gonna be honest there are a couple things that I would change about this app one that you have to pay for some things but other then that good! I‚Äôm only on my two day streak but I like it!
5,blah lahblah1!!,Very easy instructions. Not to difficult but does require brain work and the more I do the easier it becomes to figure it out.
5,courtneywasherefirst,"I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgifted‚Äù person, according to the IQ testü§ì, with high emotional intelligence, The Orphan archetypeü´†, and a ‚Äúfight‚Äù trauma response. It‚Äôs only day one, and I'm having fun learning about myselfüò©üò≠ Just kidding. It has been interesting so far."
5,Romeroii81,"This really is a great app. Fun games and tests. Great way to learn more about oneself and keep your mind sharp. Can be a little pricey for some, but it‚Äôs worth it based on what it offers. I highly recommend."
5,Peluquera chula 96,Very fun interactive games that allow you to get some insight into your abilities and self. I was able to find out my IQ score with this app. Love the personality and trauma tests.
5,Trisha Clark,I am at an age where I am forgetful at times.  Trying to increase my memory and thought process.  This is really a great way to enjoy doing just that.
5,lorenzoshit,So I really enjoy Impulse. I just recently started. I‚Äôm just really bad at the math lol I do recommend this to anybody and I will recommend it to my friends and family. I love the challenge. Thank you Impulse.
5,Crystal loving momma,"This is a wonderful app. I‚Äôd use it every day I I could afford it. I‚Äôm a single mom on disability, and I don‚Äôt have the extra money to buy a years subscription. I wish I did! The app is great."
5,Taylorfan32,"Only my second day using this app. I really like how it‚Äôs put together, the gaming order, and do believe if I‚Äôm consistent my mind will be sharper over time using this app."
5,hannahbananananananananana,I got rid of my social media apps because I was tired of my brain rotting and my attention span thinning. This app is perfect to keep your brain busy and gives you a goal to work towards.
5,Nickwrob,"I‚Äôm still very new to the app, but i like the simplicity and ease of use to get started. This seems like something i can get into the habit of doing daily."
5,Shooting star 12345,"I really like the fun little games. The IQ tests, the comparing to people. I definitely feel my brain engaged in the activity that is going on and hopefully it helps in the long run."
5,Dstclair,"This app is engaging, fun, and useful. I can‚Äôt wait to get on this app daily. I look forward to playing the games. I know I will improve on my critical thinking skills by using this game."
5,Dukesofsteel,A few games gets my mind ready for sleep. Much better than scrolling.
5,1Butterfly Queen,"Great mind games, it builds your speed, visuals, and ability to figure out the game you‚Äôre playing. I would definitely recommend this app to others."
5,everydaycray,"Great üß† training app.  I purchased the Impulse app this year, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it!  Really love the wide variety of games and tests.  If I was a puzzle üß©  person, I would enjoy the selection of puzzles  too."
5,Amyjo72036212,I really like using this app so far. It is a fun way to strengthen my mind. The games are varied and there are a lot of levels. I wish it didn‚Äôt cost as much as it does though.
5,Peet Mesquit,"Recommendable! The games make you think. They are challenging and yet fun enough to keep your interest peaked, giving you some consistent mental exercise!"
5,9893107man,I really enjoy the challenging puzzles and get a kick to see how well I performed against my peers. Anyone on the fence should go give it a try. You will most definitely not be disappointed!
2,bee.11,"Seems like a great app and the quizzes may be helpful however they don‚Äôt tell you that you don‚Äôt get your results for the quiz unless you pay. I spent about 15 minutes on a quiz and I could not read the results without paying for a weekly, or monthly subscription to full access."
5,Jbeknowiiin,Definitely my go to when I want to use my logic. Love the variety of the game each day differently testing you and I enjoy the peer comparison let‚Äôs me know I‚Äôm on track ! Thank you
5,extramayoplease,I don‚Äôt like game apps because I feel like I get addicted and then waste a lot of time on them. This is different- I‚Äôm playing games but I‚Äôm exercising my brain at the same time! Win-win!
5,doxa04.v,"The games are fun but also challenging, definitely a better time consuming game than playing things that don‚Äôt train your mind."
5,KamKam209,"Very distracting! Something to do while your sitting down and trying to improve your brain as well, would recommend!"
3,MARIAM M 13,"i wish when you PAY for a year, your account and process would sync with your other apple products. i downloaded and started on my ipad and the app on my phone doesn‚Äôt show any of my progress. pretty frustrating"
1,Frstimer,"I tried out this app only to find its ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù a waste of time, very simple, no differentiation or response-based adjustments, endless repetitions of same type & level task, and no response after taking their unimodal ‚Äúintelligence test‚Äù unless you bought a subscription-just like the countless intelligence tests found on social media marketing click bait ads. Save yourself time. Avoid it."
4,MisMaria1969,"Day 2, and I‚Äôm seeing what I believed to be true. I‚Äôm hoping this practicing will me overcome some of these obstacles‚Ä¶ I have a very difficult time and they cause so much anxiety. Hoping this will help a-leave some of this anxiety so I can have a calmer more productive life."
5,RLW Tucson,I don‚Äôt hate the notifications or games. Usually I will not do any kind of video games but these do seem to create interest.
5,Official‚Äù The Dude‚Äù,Little bit to many adds but the service is free and they do deserve the money for their hard work.
5,Jenny in AK,I started a few days ago and I love spending small snips of time working on these skills. I‚Äôve replaced time I spent doing mindless things with activities that are improving my cognitive skills.
5,Ms.Kendra91,"I didn‚Äôt go very far in school, and I‚Äôve been wanting to go back to get my high school diploma. This is helping to exercise my brain and get me prepared to learn again! Challenging, but fun!!"
5,ninabuttons17,"I enjoy using this and it keeps me from loosing the sharpness and recall without the embarrassment of people. Wish it was funded another way, just can‚Äôt fit it in the budget."
5,KAHMED03,It‚Äôs really fun. Challenging games but also short enough to have just a few minutes a day to do something different.
5,ComeBloodyAngel,Great app I can get lost in all the puzzles a problems it presents me and It‚Äôs interactive so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve wasted my time. Like I would scrolling trough short videos
5,Cfizzla,"Rather than swiping through pictures of people you don‚Äôt actually talk to or see IRL, use that time to actively keep your mind engaged."
5,Martycruz,I am not one to play games online but this is more than games; it is really a brain workout but a fun one ! I am loving it so far and hoping to improve my mental clarity in many ways !
1,?!$&nickname,"Did you really just push an update where I am forced to watch an ad? I installed last week and was considering buying because I was enjoying the games, it was rather lovely to have an unfettered experience not tarnish by ads and then I updated and play one game and am forced into an interactive ad that will not progress unless I interact with it. That‚Äôs atrocious and I will uninstall."
5,Lyricallfye,Really needed something like this to get my critical thinking going in the morning! I am a tattoo artist and crazy as this sounds- this app helps with my anxiety and focus before I start the day!
5,JJay H,"I really have boosted not only my intelligence but also my confidence!! My performance & all around character I‚Äôve been informed, has been nothing short of amazing & beautiful!! Thank u!!!"
5,An improvement in scoring,"In the first couple days, I‚Äôve found these games quick, varied and interesting.  The feedback is quick and motivating."
5,Daddy_Angel TNT,At age 72 I have questioned if my brain was still functioning like it used to because I sometimes forget little things; but these are great exercises that help me stay focused.
5,KensingtonPark,"I have played a lot of brain training and exercise games, and Impulse is one of the best! A great daily exercise system with the ability to play individual games as well."
5,Mowowmeow,This is a fun way to keep your brain sharp. There are brain exercises that include puzzles to solve and games to play.  There are helpful questionnaires included to help you discover more about yourself.
5,ninja.mattydea,Quick or longer if you want. Lots of different games to help keep your brain sharp. Plus metrics versus other users to stoke your competitive spirit.
2,Apria64,I would enjoy this app if it wasn‚Äôt overloaded with ads. Every time you begin to relax there is another stupid useless ad I never watch because I‚Äôve seen them all and they couldn‚Äôt more irrelevant. So don‚Äôt bother unless you want to watch ads two thirds of the time you spend on the app. I‚Äôm pretty sick of ‚Äò‚Äòem myself.
5,Karisma B.,Trying my brain.  Immediately caught my attention.  It‚Äôs a delightful time while using my time wisely playing the different games. I will continue to play not only because it‚Äôs fun but beneficial. Thanks.
5,Miss dee rae,"Much neeed social media break and wanted to try something new! So happy I did, it‚Äôs been fun for the whole family and actually making me use my brain as opposed to mindless scrolling!"
5,The firery speedy hooman,"When I first downloaded this app, I didn‚Äôt understand how fun it was. It also improved my memory over time. All of the mini-games are really fun. I recommend this app."
3,Abitofeverythang,I absolutely enjoy this app! I have been spending more time on here than social media and that has been great the only downside is the ads for the games that you display are absolutely inappropriate and disgusting. Basically it‚Äôs showing soft porn.
5,‚ô•Ô∏éñ¢†„ÉÉ·úäÍ®Ñ‡ºí‚àûÔ∏éÔ∏éñ†òñ¢†‚úÑ¬©,"It's a really fun and it helps with memory and helps your brain get stronger, I would appreciate if there was less adds though."
5,3303popo,Can help keep your brain fresh over the summer for school or can just help it perform better. Don‚Äôt need a pro version or anything to play either!
5,SarahMascara,It‚Äôs challenging. It‚Äôs fun. Play as little or as much as you would like to. My memory is sharpening. My brain is getting a workout every single day. And I look forward to it. Great app!!
2,Phthylo,"I miss one time purchase apps. This app is cute, so I hate to leave a bad review, but it is insanely over priced, and I just wasted 10 minutes (72 questions) taking a test that‚Äôs results are behind a paywall. There was no disclaimer that ‚Äúyour test results won‚Äôt be available unless you pay,‚Äù which genuinely infuriates me."
5,Brian6876,I have been using this app for two days and have definitely seen improvements.
5,britt.bish,Whenever I‚Äôm feeling blah and like I can‚Äôt think stressful I play on this app for a few minutes and it really helps my mood and brain function!
5,Peterbau99,It‚Äôs a nicely made game to train your brain everyday. Unlike other games that just recycle old questions or puzzles and gets very tiresome or boring.
5,Garc√≠a-Haro,It is a great APP just a little bit at a time helps you feel sharp! You may be surprised! Don‚Äôt think about it. Get it! Try it! You will look forward to it!!!
5,Dab dab da great,Yet to properly feel the effects of this but the games they have us play make sense on how it‚Äôll keep our minds sharp. I did only start yesterday.
1,anonsocmanager,"These games and app are all really disappointing and kind of pseudoscience-y. I tried the quizzes, puzzles, and games and it all seems very strongly driven by pseudoscience. I‚Äôm coming up on the end of trying to use this app for a year and I can say I‚Äôve been happily using Elevate for ~120 days straight - I disliked this app by comparison enough that every time I use it I feel disappointed in wasting money on it."
5,Kimberlee B.,Doing these exercises has lifted my brain out of a fog!  These are great ‚Äúgames‚Äù that literally leave me feeling energized and fresh for my next task at hand. Best app I‚Äôve bought!
1,DieselC123,"I signed up for a lifetime subscription‚Äîwhich, I would believe lasts A LIFETIME. And after 12 months I was sent an annual renewal reminder. I sent a help request, which never got answered.  Honestly, I love the app. As a cancer survivor I struggled with brain fog from chemo and the games on this app helped me a great deal. I just don‚Äôt appreciate the misleading pricing and would like to have my lifetime subscription restored."
5,chdisksndbrji,This is like the best game ever I like it so much you can play so many different games and it helps you with like math and other stuff download this game trust me you won‚Äôt regret it.
5,daughterdaddy,"Made an impulse buy and bought it for a year. I‚Äôm a gamer, but tired of doing things that don‚Äôt stretch my brain out creatively. So I‚Äôm going to make sure the impulse was worth it."
2,JerMusic27,"If you‚Äôre not going to pay for this subscription, do not bother to even try this app.   During my trial I was over ran with ads, trying to get you to buy games, and I couldn't even use the app for its intended purpose. It may be better once you pay the subscription, but it‚Äôs not worth trying for me."
4,KLM..,"There are a lot of adds, but you can pay to remove them. It also takes a while to unlock different games, but the free games are really fun. And they are challenging. Some of the games do make me mad tho."
5,hdhdhdjrjfh,I like how not a lot of things cost money and how everything is kinda perfectly playable and not to many ads overall great game definitely helps with adhd
5,TTBrowns,Trying to exercise my brain a bit more. It seems to work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to keep at it. The games are challenging but not too hard. I enjoy it.
5,Lmg1007,It‚Äôs encouraging to know that doing something on my phone is actually beneficial. I really enjoy the games and the daily training goes by quick!
4,Oma Ray,"I‚Äôve barely gotten started with the App, but so far I am liking the challenge! I‚Äôm 66, newly retired and have a mother that is deep into the final stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking and terrifying all at the same time. Lots of motivation to keep my brain as active as possible."
5,EssDeeEss,I enjoy playing these brain training games. They are a lot of fun and a great way to fill small moments in time knowing I am doing something helpful for my memory.
5,RE5 BOY,"I‚Äôve only been using it for a few days now, but I really enjoy a lot of the ‚Äúgames‚Äù and feel like I‚Äôm helping myself and not just wasting time playing games."
5,Jaycie Wilcox,"This is a really fun game that jaleos strengthen my brain, but I don‚Äôt like that almost everything needs to be paid for. I would like it if we had access to more games."
4,Not Seth 2023,I love this app don‚Äôt get me wrong I have a berry hard time with math and it helps me sharpen my minds but they want you to start a free trial and crashes a few times I still love this app though and think everyone should get it.
5,colliben,Usually get bored with things like this after a couple days. Impulse provides a ton of variability in the activities so it always feels like something fun and new.
5,Jordan Syd,"This game is absolutely amazing. I have a brain injury, and it challenges my brain in all the best ways. I took a personality test and the end results were scary accurate. I highly recommend this game."
4,Chenzo4u,The puzzles and workouts are fun and get more challenging over time. I don‚Äôt like the picture puzzles as the logic is often convoluted and the pictures are often not detailed enough to make decisions about.
5,ReetyBird,"Very fun way to improve memory. The challenge is definitely there, but the fun of doing the exercises makes it feel like a game. Definitely worth trying out."
5,djhmon,I really enjoy using this app especially because I graduated a few years ago so this app makes me feel like I am doing something to keep my brain sharp
5,Ignacio el Original,"I suffer from anxiety and whenever I feel like my anxiety will hit I try to play this mind games and it help reduce it. Because it keeps me busy in something else, I recommend this game"
5,aabdu62,"This app is great, it gives you lots of games to choose from and increase your intelligence. There are a few ads, but can be easily skipped. Great game overall!"
5,zmoari,I always feel really accomplished when I use Impulse. And I‚Äôve noticed a significant difference in my processing time. Highly recommend!!
5,CoachSam60,"Impulse is a great way to get so many things going. Thinking, anticipating, dexterity, and just simple fun engagement.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give it more than 2 thumbs up!!"
4,Timmy iShimmy,I enjoy the app a ton but would love it more if I could involve my family without having to pay for each of them to download. Are there any plans for a Family Plan of some sorts?
5,kokesita,I love it only takes a few minutes and is also entertaining : )
1,mx_nih,"Their training games are good, not anything other apps don‚Äôt have. The ads and pop ups asking you to pay for a subscription are a bit too much. What really bugged me was the ‚Äútests‚Äù section, they don‚Äôt mention anything about having to pay to see results, so you do the entire test only for them to then inform you that you need to pay to see your results."
5,Richwog69,"Definitely recommend if looking to challenge your self, sharpen your mind, work on your memory or problem skills or simply unwind"
5,Camelot time,Really good thinking games to stimulate the mind. I have to really think about each game but they are still not too difficult to figure out. Just enough.
5,1lameusername,I like that it really makes you think. Each stage appears to build on each other. It‚Äôs also helping me with my lack of memory. 1lameusername
5,me-sgk,It‚Äôs fun and i believe it does help your brain as youReview of  keep improving your score with practice.  The different areas that you practice are interesting to perform as well as enjioyabke while you are performing them.  C good
5,CMumea,"By far the most engaging and fun app I have used in a long, long time.  I can‚Äôt wait to see how it helps my cognition over the upcoming weeks and months. Thank you!"
5,ZSImoney,Fun games and I feel the reason I downloaded the game I‚Äôm getting that. At least I feel smart playing the joint. Only my 2nd day playing so I‚Äôll leave another review soon!
5,momasof2020,"I chose strengthening the brain! Definitely a great option, I love the games, love that there‚Äôs morning, mid day and afternoon suggested ones!! Love that they are quick. ‚ù§Ô∏è definitely becoming one of my go to apps"
5,Ghost rooms?,The variety of games and the nuerodivergency of the exercises really helps improve cognitive skills and challenges me in ways I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of. Highly recommend !!
5,hernandeeznuts,This brain game is so amazing. I could play it all day. I‚Äôve tried so many brain games that are not good And don‚Äôt work for me and this one is just really really great. I am so happy I found this brain game!
5,TIZLUV,I have only used this App for a few days but I am truly satisfied with workouts for my brain. I suffer with High Anxiety and now when I am struggling I have this App to help me stay focus.
5,Esdes_,Just started using it but the games really test all different skills. Took an IQ test and will take another at the end of 2 weeks to see what my improvement is. If any.
5,miss.ladyolivia,"A great game to play to pass time. I‚Äôve played this game when I couldn‚Äôt sleep, while I wait at doctor appointments, and  in long car rides. I feel it‚Äôs a great way to exercise my brain."
5,Ludachris2530,"I have trouble retaining a lot of things and this app really helps me in all aspects plus it‚Äôs really fun as well. It also encourages healthy habits, like doing 20 squats and avoiding sugar.  I highly recommend this app. I love it!!"
5,MrFckYoBtch,Other brain game/teaser apps are more like riddles as oppose to this app that actually has games that help you build and exercise those cognitive skills I love it! You should download it.. Do it.. Don‚Äôt be a puss..
5,mic reg art,I‚Äôve been playing 10 mins a day and I can see my mind organizing information as it presents itself in a much more efficient way.
5,Porkchop&chunky,This was something that was not like most games. It's not boring they switch up to keep it interesting and you have the ability to change speed. Nice Job!!!
2,youremusty,"I'd like to at least say the content is good but there's an ad after almost every click that prevents me from really focusing on the puzzles and everything else. I get you have to make money somehow, and a subscription isn't very expensive at all, but dang. Did I download an application or an advertisement farm? I'll stick to Elevate."
1,MonsterTakeOver,If you want to pay for it go for it. But if you‚Äôre like me and hate ads and hate that you have to pay for a subscription. Then don‚Äôt waste your time. I turn off the data for every app. This game will not let you play without data or wifi and you need to buy a subscription to unlock the content. Oh and there‚Äôs ads! The ads are just the cherry on top of their revenue
5,SofiaJ.,"I really liked this app, but I only wanted the triel. I downloaded it today, how can I cancel it before I get charged for it? Is that possible or will I need to give approval after the three day period to purchase it? Thanks!"
5,Lisasueredues,So far I really enjoy it has not been glitchy I like the different challenges we will see if it helps exercise my brain?
3,Mr.MadFox,Hi! I'm reviewing my experience on this game and it was really great! However I had some trouble exiting out of the add WOODOKU and it was really frustrating. I'm sure other users have had this problem and I don't wanna keep having to re-enter the game. The game is really great including earned discounts please do block WOODOKU adds thank you!
5,Johnvix,I just started but already feel like it is going to be helpful to me. I am 70 Years old and want to improve my memory and cognitive ability.
5,GNAKNAI,"This app is very simple and is sure to make sure you know how long a test is before hand. Once completed, the app gives nice detailed yet concise statistics. Very nice!"
1,Qblr,"Such a cool idea and series of activities but the moment I spent 10 minutes on a test that I can only see the results of by subscribing, I deleted the app. I can see where that goes and hate that kind of manipulation. In app ads is a fair price for not choosing to pay for something. Maybe they‚Äôd do better with that approach."
5,melanies_Starzz,It barley gives adds and when i play it i think it really fun also i love how it gives you a percentage and how much percent you beat your peers pls try this game!
5,MUSCLE I.V.,"Life's always about constant improvement. Remember, progress is progress. This app helps to keep your mind sharp in my opinion, so that you can go out and conquer life üëåüòé."
5,Lfitz1209,I find these games fun and interesting.  I like to see how I compare b/c sometimes it‚Äôs very surprising.  Always interested in keeping myself physically fit!  My brain included!
5,Cjhansen122,"I really like the brain games, but I do wish it didn‚Äôt require a subscription to access all the features of the app."
5,awesomealex523,I‚Äôve only used it a few days but can already tell it‚Äôs sharpening things up!  I suffered a stroke and this will be a great piece of my therapy to help me get fully back TO ME
5,nickxlight,I enjoy having a game on my phone that benefits me & improves my brains ability to process things. I‚Äôve noticed my memory has started to go and this terrifies me.
5,Limary,I‚Äôm all about learning and this app is both helping me develop my metal agility while it feels like a game the entire time. Love it and would recommend it.
5,GrannyGypsy,"The only reason I won‚Äôt be going forward with this app as a daily- is just $. I don‚Äôt mind spending it, I just don‚Äôt have the income to be able to."
5,shawnalenee92,Quick easy games to play and you have so much fun you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre doing work! I love seeing where I compare to others
4,Sagan J,"I haven‚Äôt seen it strengthen yet, but based on what I did last night, maybe it did! I finally beat one geometry dash level I have been trying to beat for months! I think it might be working. Recommended!!!!!!"
5,Tom999ooo,Please play the game if you want training on your brain I‚Äôm already seeing improvement and I just started yesterday‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòç
5,ASydDo,It gave me an opportunity to take a few minutes to stop over thinking from work.  And gave my brain a small mental break.
5,‚ÄîMichael__,"Well worth it, during the free trial (don‚Äôt pick a payment plan just yet) if you win a game you have an opportunity to get 95% off. And the challenges are actually very good"
2,Looshbgoosh,"I got sucked in by an ad claiming this app could help me with ADHD. I paid 9.99 for the app alone, then was asked to pay a 6.99 weekly subscription fee. The games were quite basic and the free version is full of ads for other addictive, ‚Äúzone out‚Äù type games. This is the opposite of how to help someone with ADHD."
5,Joe95837,"I haven‚Äôt gotten too far into the program, but I like it a lot. It is refreshing to realize that I remember what I learned over 50 years ago."
5,Carrisa Lynne,Love this app! I suffered a TBI back in 2019 and this has been so cool to see the progress of all the hard work I‚Äôve done to get back to efficiency and see what I can do!!
4,Wildwulf2007,"Lot of ads, but they are easy to skip. Only a couple seconds long. Games are fun and challenging, and the IQ test actually gives you a score. You can pay for a more detailed report of your IQ"
5,Luckrob,I enjoy brain games and puzzles. This game has by far been up to my standards. I‚Äôm loving it so far. It really does wake me up. Other games have been too easy for me.
5,Lyla Barnes,"I have a fun but challenging day on this app it‚Äôs quite fun you should download it , it does have adds every game though but you can just turn your WiFi offüòÄ"
5,Zorojuro3000,"Lots of fun games to sharpen your mind, only takes a little bit of time out of day! Better spent doing this than scrollingüëçüèº"
5,Homie671,The tasks are challenging and fun.  I look forward to this each morning. I‚Äôm not a person who plays games much at all but I love challenges. A great combination of both.
3,GR159,"I have had this app for a month, I am not sure if it‚Äôs doing what they claim it does. I don‚Äôt see any consistent results in my preference. Sometimes I do great on a task, other times not se much. I am not sure I would buy it again. I definitely can‚Äôt recommend it at this point."
5,Jackie9712,I took the time to review because I believe I have finally found the best brain trainer app ever!  I have tried many! This one really understands your brain and how it works!  Thank you Impulse!
5,AugustKukuk,"I wish you didn‚Äôt have to purchase anything, or lock into a subscription otherwise it is awesome!!! So glad I came across it by mistake"
3,9lives,"The graphics of the games are flat & not immersive, which is notable at the outset, but recently over the past few days the game will not start & there has been no acknowledgment of an issue from the app developers."
5,BusyDadof13,You will enjoy improving with this easy to understand but still just the right amount of challenge app.
5,TX_Mom,I got the app because I saw that it had the connect the pipes game but since I‚Äôve gotten it I‚Äôve discovered all sorts of other ones that I love too. It‚Äôs a great way to pass the time.
5,Amanda8207,It chooses the exercises and doesn‚Äôt over do the time you need to spend on them. Can play for a little bit or for hours.  üëçüèªüëçüèª
5,Uothasdope,"What better to spend a little of your free time improving yourself. The achievements this app gives, helps motivate you to do better. Try it out!"
4,Person1848,I don‚Äôt like that you have to pay to see your results but at least it shows you at the top of the screen. I couldn‚Äôt choose but I would give it 4.5.
5,Gonnzo,Just started using but enjoying it so far. Instructions are clear & mini-games aren‚Äôt terribly difficult (yet). Look forward to my daily dose!
1,Britistheshit,"I'm not sure why I was charged for the free trial, instead of given the 3 days free. And im also not allowed access to any reports, without upgrading. But I was supposed to have access to pro for 3 days and then charged 6.99. Instead I was charged 6.99 and don't have access to anything except the tests which said that my IQ was an 89, which is insulting to say the least. This is a junk app."
5,theklausmeister,Been playing these games for two days now.  Hope to improve my mental health after some time.  Entertaining and simple.  Thank you.
4,Dino lovers,"When I take any of the tests it only tells me what I got it doesn‚Äôt show me what it says it would without buying premium or whatever. Please fix this, my mom won‚Äôt let me buy it but I want to know what I got!"
5,wendilyn1826,"I like the challenge, the fun, the way it makes you think.  I also like to know at 60+ I‚Äôm still able to be quick and accurate."
5,I Live to tax,Testing your ability to use your brain gives you a good feeling (or not if you don‚Äôt do well) based on your achievements.
5,Lizette582,I was getting kinda frighten with my memory lately. I‚Äôm 31 and this is easing my mind that I‚Äôm on the right path. It‚Äôs also helping me concentrate and decompress. Definitely worth the money
5,stevefh82,"These games are quick, fun and they keep my mind focused. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a 10 minute game break to stay mentally sharp throughout the day"
5,Unhappyscale,Just started using it. Enjoy the tests to work my brain without all the ads from these crazy other games.
5,wackywalb,"Not sure if it actually helps yet but the games are easy, different (not the same thing over and over) and fun! reminders help"
5,Whutchuwant,The games are quick and it‚Äôs more stimulating than playing a game on your phone plus it helps with your memory.
5,sammifromdabloc,I really like playing these games and I like to see what my scores are and what I can better improve on after playing.
5,aaaahhbdodnbn,"This app makes me feel good about myself in a way i never felt before. It sharpens my brain and body. Really great app, thank you so much! Can‚Äôt wait for more updates ü•π"
4,Jherold81,"I like the app it would be nice to see when it states you out performed a certain percentage, if it showed you the amount of people that make up the percentage. Just a idea"
4,Raptortrainer89,It‚Äôs not to bad if you don‚Äôt pay really you just can‚Äôt see your full results unless you pay I just wish you could see some of the results for free that‚Äôs all other then that it ain‚Äôt to bad
5,phyL2014,In a world where we already get lost in our phones; I enjoy doing something that isn‚Äôt mind numbing. I‚Äôm also competitive and enjoy seeing how many of my peers I am beating! Haha!
5,Lissyjoycross,"Love this app! It has a ton of games to choose from that are designed to help strengthen your brain. If you are a curious person like me, Impulse app also has a bunch of different test for IQ and personality."
1,Flappingsparrow,"Yet another app that hides its price from you until you‚Äôve wasted your time on setup. Just tell me up front that you want $7 a week for puzzles so I know not to download.  Edit: the developer responded with lies. I downloaded the app again and went through the whole onboarding process again to double check. Maybe I just missed the free option right?   Nope. There is no free version at all. You get 3 billing options and a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù. The free trial is 3 days, and then it switches you to weekly billing. This is 100% not a free app.   I don‚Äôt care if you want to make money on your app, but stop with these scummy smoke and mirror tricks. Just be honest that the app costs money."
5,Kramer329,During a day when I‚Äôm constantly grinding away with coding I open this game to take my mind off what I was doing. I feel relaxed after playing a few games
5,Bgreen418,"I‚Äôve never heard of brain training, but once downloading this app I have noticed a huge difference in my way of thinking and concentration and so forth. I hi  go my recommend it!"
5,Impressed_4_Impulse,"I am just getting started, but the game ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù offers a wide variety of cognitive testing through using speed as a metric. The diversity of games are fun and I want to stay engaged."
5,Rivers Coop,I love these tests although they can be difficult and confusing. They challenge me and help me to understand my own skills and what I‚Äôm rated against my peers. Good stuff for the spirit. Good Luck everyone.
5,Youngpro15,"Extremely helpful to do before work or school each day, wakes up your brain and processing skills. 10/10 would recommend."
5,BuleSilver88,"This is a fun and easy way to help improve your mental skills, boost your IQ, and improve your life. Would highly recommend for both kids and adults."
5,Susan OP,"I love being challenged,  however I am doing this on my cell phone and the typing is too Small to read quickly.  Any solutions for me?  Thanks so much!  This is great fun!"
1,JustTrixie,"I liked this app at first so I went ahead and subscribed taking advantage of a discounted subscription price.  I‚Äôve been playing daily for about a month now and it is the same 5 or 6 games every single day and they are now BORING!!!  I want to cancel my subscription but lo and behold, they make it nearly impossible to do so.  I would recommend staying away from this app."
5,Rbones 68,At the very least try the free trial. I found quickly that I enjoyed this and once I played the free trial I got a 96% off deal from Impulse. It ended up being 56 cents a week.
5,JC Mixer,"Great game to improve mental acuity. Even though I‚Äôm in my 40s, I still feel like I need to keep my mind sharp and this game app is what I need in my opinion."
5,Patience81,It‚Äôs fun and I love it but I think it needs to be free. I don‚Äôt know why you have to pay to strengthen your brain especially when you‚Äôre old.
1,DCMarvelGirly,"So I did the 3 day trial and immediately cancelled because I wanted to play before I decided to subscribe. Also, I can‚Äôt really afford it right now, I thought it looked fun. I can‚Äôt even get the report without signing back up for a subscription. I don‚Äôt want anything from the developer, I just want it known that I will be deleting the app and it won‚Äôt be on my phone ever again."
5,TarynES,Accidentally became addicted to this gameüòÖ very fun way to text yourself and even shows what percentage of your peers you performed better than. I think that‚Äôs why I keep playing ü§£
5,DanishIrish,"I strongly believe that if you don‚Äôt keep challenging your brain, it won‚Äôt get stronger and with age it will start beginning to have more cognitive decline."
5,gdxcgffffff,This is just the best! Know I have something awesome to help me with my wondering brain and the synapses fire off just right. I feel great! Finally something to challenge my brain and give me focus.
5,Kotlc book reader_Tam song,This app is amazing you don‚Äôt even have to buy things for it to be great. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing and it‚Äôs good app to waste time on or if you want a good IQ test non the less it‚Äôs amazing
5,Ahneria,It is good it help me to relax but most stuff like this you always have to pay but I didn‚Äôt and I can still get a little bit better
5,Milsnickens,I have experienced some brain fog as I have entered my 40s and it has made me feel crazy. I invested in this to help me get my mental focus back. So far I really love it. üëçüèºüëçüèºüòä
5,Liono23,Games help me mentally get through my break ups with 4 of my girlfriends and when my great grandfather died falling off a step stool and when my mentor passed away from getting in a fight with a pedestrian.
5,2cutthroat4leah,I love the app I feel like it‚Äôs improved my cognitive ability.I only with everything would be free so I could further develop my mind thank you
2,Sabesey,"The games were mostly fun, but I went through the entire IQ test just to be hit with a ""pay to proceed with results"" page after I completed the 20 MINUTE quiz, and i was using the 3 day free trial. They want you to subscribe before receiving results for something that's supposed to be for fun, or pay an extra $5. Unethical practice."
5,Immmmmmms,I think that impuls is a great app but 1 thing I don‚Äôt like is that u don‚Äôt have veary much time but other than that I think that u should definitely get the game if u like challenging things
5,Whbrawer,I love the trainings and look forward to them. I was hooked right off the bat and am using this app to stay cognitively agile. Highly recommend for the fun as well as the brain training.
5,MemenanaGG,I have used Impulse for the last 2 years. I've never found a brain training program better than impulse!
5,Magic_Rogue,Look forward to my ten minutes of brain exercise. I love learning and this is a fun way to keep my mind sharp and ready to focus on other tasks.
5,PositiveChil,A couple minutes a day and it can help with many different aspects of daily brain functions.
5,love your themes,It is so good and it has helped me so so much. I tried so many apps so when I saw I knew I had to try it and I ask so happy I did because it is all I have been looking for.
4,Rpcykp,So far I really enjoy this app and like the different aspects associated with it but have only had it for two days so I can‚Äôt really give an honest evaluation yet
3,Zoo revue,"It‚Äôs fast paced, it‚Äôs creative, it‚Äôs enjoyable. That‚Äôs it. I would rather play the game than writing a review. I am sure there are people with a lot lower IQ than myself would like to express their intelligence in this review. Thanks for the game. Thanks for the challenge. Please don‚Äôt ask me to write another video review."
5,Gavin Leroy,"I love it so much, not only does it help with your brain power, it‚Äôs also fun. And it just catches my attention and then I just wanna play it!!! Definitely a 5 star rating from me!!!ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô"
5,lolkfjfjf,This app is very good for brain training and making you smarter! I used this game just for two days and already notice a difference and my ability to focus!
5,cChriistyy,"I love the games, and puzzles impulse has! I love to play brain games, this is my favorite app so far. Highly recommend paying so you don‚Äôt have to deal with the Ads though."
3,hddicbx,"I subscribed to this app for the ADHD type test to better understand myself, and there is no test for it anywhere.   The puzzles they had are fun and quick, but even with reminders, if I‚Äôm not in the mood to do them, I don‚Äôt. Will not be renewing my subscription when it runs out."
5,Sosmoovematt,"This game really helps me with my focus, consistency, and concentration. (Which is something I personally don't hone in on) therefore, these games help me increase the attention/time amount spent on what the game is asking me to do!"
5,TheNaJoKing,"Is fun game, and is nice to help my brain with small games like these. üëçüèº"
5,grchhgfdhgfdhgfd,It‚Äôs so good I learned how to do this in 5 seconds and it‚Äôs good for ur brain I had to redo college but once I downloaded this app I understood a lot of puzzles and things in life so thanks!
5,Bella_xoxo:),"I love it because there are not too many ads, and it is still easily playable without premium. I love the games and they are simple to play ( they can get tricky though haha)"
5,megs9443,I have not sprung for the version that costs money yet but I‚Äôm definitely considering it. The memory and mental math practice games have been helpful since having a tbi.
5,Tininilove,If need t achieve a small sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning or any time of day‚Ä¶ impulse is the way to do it! I‚Äôm excited for every challenge I‚Äôm sure you will be too!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
5,Rachelmn76,I love this app! It‚Äôs a super fun way to train my brain- I use it everyday. I especially like the quiet reminders it gives me to take a quick 2 min break from my day and play a game / train my brain.
5,Kittycat3378900,Great games to keep the brain sharp! Takes a few minutes a day to play the brain games and give your brain a workout!
5,brandonmorningstar,By far a wonderful app! Easy starting levels building up until it‚Äôs truly challenging! It‚Äôs engaging and one will never have a dull moment on this app!
5,Bambi Luv,"Before playing this game, it was hard for me to remember everything. Now I‚Äôm starting to remember things little by little. All due to playing this game everyday."
5,Ninja warrior 10,"This set of games is a more welcome distraction than social media. If you have ten minutes, sharpen your brain instead of scrolling."
5,ButchMorton,"Quick set of games to test your skills - visual, math, etc.  Fun to play and the performance stats keep my interest - want to do better, and play more. Thoroughly enjoy!"
1,hdjxnebebdjf,Just wanted something I could spend some spare moments on to increase memory and such. But everything requires the upgrade to premium! Took a test on the app and you have to pay to see the answer. Wasted my time answering 40 questions. Can only play like 5 games a day free basically the rest of the free ones are boring. Would rate a 0 stars if I could
5,shoshees,I‚Äôm not a game person.  I do feel this so different.  Helps me focus on what matters and gives me a quick rest in my day. It‚Äôs like a brain refresh.
5,Noodles762,I have used this and similar games over the years.  This one is more engaging and fun than most.
5,Bmorty72,I am suffering from a TBI and left leg amputation following a motorcycle accident 4 years ago and I‚Äôm am trying to find ways to recover both my mind and body.
5,Bolch44,Brain fog is no joke after 40. This app is full of fun and challenging but quick games to challenge you. I look forward to my brain gym sessions everyday.
1,DougieFreshSoCal,"I had only used this app a couple times, and promptly uninstalled it and canceled the trial subscription. 7 days later and it insists on charging my family‚Äôs plan payment method for another week of the PRO version. Who can I contact about this, the data will show I did not use this app for more than 5 minutes, and I uninstalled it.   Just a warning."
5,MariaBonita74,"I truly like this app because they present you with challenging and engaging games that help you to improve your concentration, orientation to detail and focus. Plus they help your mental math skills to stay sharp."
5,DemiKit666,It doesn‚Äôt even feel like you‚Äôre training your brain. You get to play all these fun little games that also help your brain in so many ways.
4,AliveAndFree,"I don‚Äôt have much time during the day or evening for that matter, but Impulse gives me a chance to build the muscle that matters most‚Ä¶my brain. A quick round or two of brain games and I feel sharper."
5,Rubiredo,I‚Äôve only downloaded the free version. It‚Äôs been pretty fun I‚Äôm sure the paid version has way more games to play. I think it‚Äôs worth giving it a try.
5,_app.lover22_,"Having adhd and not wanting to take medications, this game is a great alternative. The game taught me to slow down and think about my next move. I found it to be a great game for helping me."
1,Metroguest,This app tricks you with easy puzzle on Instagram and tricks you into thinking only smart people can figure it out (which makes you want to prove you‚Äôre smart because it‚Äôs obvious what the answer is and we all love feeling like we know the ‚Äúright‚Äù) answer. Once you download its $30 or some joke of a fee. I might put a dollar for puzzle app. But not an annual fee. What a joke.
5,Faithier29,"I‚Äôve been trying to find an app that‚Äôll help with my memory, test my IQ, sharpen my cognitive functioning, etc., and this app has it all! I truly would recommend this app to anyone."
5,gingermidge,It‚Äôs been an easy habit to start working on the brain every morning and just before bed. Addictive format makes you want to continue and improve. Grand game!!
5,PvtJoy,"I thought the games were going to be easy, but surprisingly I was challenged, especially with the basic Math.  I think the game is great but over priced."
5,Tdiggadee,I can be kind of a scatterbrain so this takes my mind off of everything that‚Äôs happening around me and makes me focus on what I‚Äôm doing right now
5,rrraquelll,This app really helps you when you need to fix something that you want to get fixed. So your not insecure how your Brian works.   You should get it!
5,AtlasV3,"Impulse is fun, creative and actually challenging enough to to hold my attention. I‚Äôve noticed several day to day benefits just from using this app in the short time that I have!"
5,kevinspelican,Hi get this app it's not even that expensive and you'll probably like it and it's good for your brain. don't you want to have a good brain? i sure do. that's why i got this app
5,AldoG.,Honestly a really good game to kill time with and challenge yourself. Keeps me interested too with the different games it has and the challenges too.
5,TezIsAwsome,I started using this app two days ago and I‚Äôm loving it and it‚Äôs been a great experience with this app when I have spare time and just need to wind down a little bit
5,beautysilverstar,"The Covid headaches really damaged some of my memory. This games is super awesome gets my brain moving & exercising. Fun quit games too. Btw I‚Äôm intelligent, just finished grad school but noticed my memory isn‚Äôt 100% so grateful for the fun brain teaser exercises."
5,Misfortunekw,"A lot of fun, super entertaining and I can see the difference in reaction and memory in just a week üôåüèº highly recommend for people trying to challenge their mind"
5,sassem18,"I love doing the test and seeing what I get, you do have to pay but there‚Äôs SO many other things you can do for free. You get daily workouts (for your brain) and lots of fun games!"
5,rashaado,"Gotta be honest it‚Äôs challenging and from my perspective also beneficial for anyone that downloads this app. Not a waste of time and with so much variety, there is plenty opportunity for advancement so yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a keeper!üíØ"
5,theemcee3,I ended up playing for an hour didn‚Äôt expect to be this hooked. And the ads aren‚Äôt bad just after every game it doesn‚Äôt interrupt in the middle like some do
5,Tootie Loveeü§çüíô,This is the best game app because it literally has EVERYTHING all in one app you could really learn from this app plus play all kind of games üíôü§çüíôü§ç Keep up the good work come out with more app‚Äôs like this !!!üíØ
5,DaisyMonea98,I love brain games. Every morning I wake up and challenge my brain and the olds games I had were getting worn out (too easy to beat) so this game is definitely just for me.
5,Thee blessed,I love how they have different challenges for a specific function to improve on. The interface is pleasing yet fast without any glitches or delays.
5,That Guy 4356,"I‚Äôve never really used this kind of app before, but this definitely gets me to think a little clearer after a series of brain teasers with daily reminders!"
5,Taysllim,"There was an ad in a game for a game that wasn‚Äôt in a game.  That game was in this game all along.  This game has all the games you have been looking for but didn‚Äôt know you needed.  You lick my brain, I‚Äôll lick yours."
3,S Is For Spirit,The free to use version has a bit too many ads. I understand it‚Äôs free but one between EVERY  is a bit much. I think it would be better to be one at the start and one at the end and then one after a set of three for tower of Hanoi.
5,Derek booth,Great way to keep my mind active and stay away from mindless scrolling. I never pay for apps but this one is worth it! Do it if you are on the fence.
1,Honest thoughts 54,Be care it automatically puts you down for $40 a month as soon as you get the app. I got the app didn‚Äôt think much of it and deleted. I downloaded as a free app and trail. I looked at my statement 2 months later and I had been charges $10 a week the whole time with a deleted app I was never on. I was also denied my request at a refund. One of those sneaky charges that gets you before you can catch and cancel it.
1,thatpersonoverthewaterfall,"After reading multiple comments about the subscription scamming, I have fully decided to delete this app. The immense amount of ads I have been getting is uncanny (one ad EVERY single time I finish a quiz/game)I cannot believe that they would make this game so money oriented rather than actual facts and IQ tests. This is very unfortunate to see and I will not be using this app in the future."
3,Lindsey ‚ù£Ô∏è,"I feel that the test should be available if we cannot see our results without paying for it, and our progress that we also can‚Äôt access with paying for it."
5,whitkand,Every night when I need to unwind I‚Äôd usually go for a meditation app but now look forward to THIS to keep my mind off everything else.
5,Victory1414,"I had a pretty good first impression, but the ads were a little bit annoying. If you are looking for a good game to stimulate your brain, this is a fun one!"
5,Will Wayde,"I don‚Äôt usually buy into these kinds of things. I tried the free trial and really liked it. So as soon as I saw a deal I liked, I bought it!!"
3,Elisagonz,I wanted to start the free trial and try things out to see if I‚Äôd be worth purchasing but you waste time taking the tests and you can‚Äôt read them unless you pay for it. The free trial is kind of pointless if I can‚Äôt actually see what the app provides.
4,Shoppingyoga,"Fun app that doesn‚Äôt require much time each day. So far pretty easy but it‚Äôs supposed to get harder as you go along. Today‚Äôs just my second day, but I do see how it could help over time."
5,Oma -,I love the fact that it tells you when it‚Äôs time to free your brain and test! It really helps ease your mind and improves your function of your brain!
5,Igavethisappa5starrating,"10/10, it makes me feel like my adhd is getting better if that makes sense lol"
1,Wastegig,Cute games but you can get the same ones for free somewhere else. The app is extremely expensive and overall misleading. The adhd type test is literally just 10 questions and tells you what percentage of their users have the same amount of adhd you do. Not the type. All of the tests are reminiscent of cosmo dating quizzes and give you about as much feedback. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.
5,msjael,Took a chance and downloaded it. Just starting to use it. The first part was cool. Looking forward to what next with this game
5,maddiebiscuit,Really enjoy the games for training and testing your skills via game method. Love how it tells us the percentage you tested in at your age group and level.
5,Ally_MN,There are three games that take about 3-4 minutes a day for training. Designed to help you improve your brain function
5,GypsyWoman72,I‚Äôm enjoying this app and all of the games and quizzes. It‚Äôs important to keep your brain active in the age of technology and A.I. and using this app is entertaining as well as beneficial.
5,andw50247,"I love this app because it has helped me on my grades, memories, feelings, emotions, and my reaction time if your reading this get this app it helps a lot( there might be some ads btw)"
5,Simoney Balogny,This app makes you feel alive and that you are actually doing your brain a service! Highly recommend!
5,LainieB74,"It‚Äôs very interesting games and some are faster paced than others. And I like to keep my brain sharpened. The exercises are well thought out, and I enjoy it."
5,Monita51,"I‚Äôm 73 and always want to be better. This game is a motivation to be stronger, accurate, knowledgeable,and definitely faster.  Enjoying it so far!"
5,nso namr,I enjoy these activities because they help to sharpen my skills or at least keep them from becoming too dull.
1,anonymous1980,Can you continue to make this game any worse?!? First it takes forever to load a game and then forever for the next game. Now you make a UI upgrade that adds a restart game right next to the move undo so you easily hit it when trying to undo. It‚Äôs to a point that I‚Äôm going to cancel and delete the app. Get your stuff together.
2,nater kane,"i was hoping to find the games to feel like more than a mindless timesuck, but that's all they are.   after a few minutes the ads start coming with fake Xs to trick you to click on them each time, earning the developer revenue in a unfortunately all too common, shady way. play for 8 seconds, ad for 30+ seconds, rinse and repeat, over, and over.   i feel like i've wasted my time.  the ads just are really too much and that leaves me to question the claimed purpose or function of the app.   now it's time to uninstall it."
5,OroroMunroeStorm,I feel like this app is helping me stay sharp and ready  for the world. I wished it wasn‚Äôt so expensive though like a lot of things these days.
4,Gabrielle Christine 19,The game is pretty fun and I like the quizzes a lot too. This game gives you something to do and is a reminder that learning and testing and challenging yourself actually can be fun if done the right way.
5,Stupid Numo,The games make me feel like I am doing something to improve my brain. I am a 68 yr old woman and very concerned about my memory. And the games are fun! I wish there would be more.
5,proy1978,I‚Äôm just starting out but it‚Äôs a nice way to see what I remember academically and memory strength. It compares you in someway against your peers who‚Äôve taken it too so it drives me to compete lol (I do not pay for it)
1,marcbittner,Video shows a trauma test that is either not in the app or too me longer to find than clicking through every tab. 10/10 move. You got me to download the app showing me something I wanted than made the thing I wanted impossible to find. If you won't make the test you advertise available take the rest and go away
5,Bremarie1994,I‚Äôm learning more about myself and challenging my brain daily. Hoping that the long term results will help with my memory and cognitive abilities. Enjoying it so far!
5,MBPDR82,"This app is an intriguing blend of fun and challenging. The games progress at a pace that keeps you enthralled and focused. If you‚Äôre looking for a game you can‚Äôt put down, pick this one up."
5,Mot0r0609,"Colors, games, instructions everything is easy to understand and makes you really practice your brain love it"
5,kitcatkittycat369,"If this is helping my brain to remember thing‚Äôs better, it‚Äôs the best app I‚Äôve purchased. It‚Äôs fun it gives you great feed back and now I‚Äôm waiting to notice the results."
1,PapaMike25,"I quite enjoy the app, but despise subscription based plans. I was offered the lifetime purchase in the introduction to the app before even seeing its functionality, and now this option is no where to be found. Very underhanded method to get people to pay monthly instead of just purchasing once. Deleted on searching for an alternative."
5,tltcdm,"Fun games, but you have to think, and read the directions. I‚Äôm liking this so far!"
5,Nikitabonita1,I love Impulse so far.  I‚Äôve only completed a few training games but I'm enjoying myself & learning a lot.  I‚Äôm looking forward to more difficult training. üëç
5,Tennessee Chic,I saw this advertised on Instagram. Downloaded it and it‚Äôs been. Didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôm not really using my brain until I started these games. This is a great way to train your brain.
5,Bmp912,"I was hesitant at first when I saw the Ad for the app on TikTok, but once I downloaded it and used the 3 day free trail period to test it out, I was pleasantly surprised at all the brain quizzes and exercises it has for your brain to train."
5,Cccoolman,I like this game it is good to see your accuracy and how well you do compared to others.  Always good to work the brain a little.  üëç
4,Shoyt79,I really like this app but I feel like my daily training is the same puzzles over and over again. The side games are fun. I prob wouldn‚Äôt purchase another subscription.
1,DarkSF01,"Actual time waster, TO BE HONEST. Only wasted like 9 minutes of my life, but gives me enough information to know what the app is like.  If you‚Äôve saw an ad on Instagram or Facebook something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat type of ____ are you? Test now‚Äù You CAN find those types of tests on the app, and you‚Äôll spend a few minutes filling out and answering the questions only to be greeted with ‚Äúsubscribe to us to see full report!‚Äù You literally just wasted 5 minutes answering questions to see nothing.  What a useless time waster money sucker. You can find better tests just on google for free, so you‚Äôre way better off with that."
5,vamp_snake_83,It‚Äôs really fun plus the price is not bad specially for whatever month do you start it starts from there and goes until next year of that $28 is not bad $.56 is not bad
5,Edyalpsid,It‚Äôs very accurate and I believe it can test u in every which way possible even to tell u if u got heart or not I love it for myself I believe it‚Äôs a great app to have it‚Äôs worth the download
5,ksgurl1000,I love the variety of games. I can feel it making my brain work harder to process what information I‚Äôm being given.
5,Ndewitte,Finally found an app that allows me to play games while exercising my brain and helping my overall memory and reaction time improve.
5,sosavi,Love the stimulation  Easy and also challenging. With lots of other options for insight into the way your brain works! recommend
1,Addierahh,"Basically they say hey take a free trial to see if this is right for you ,right? Then with each test you take, it requests that you pay for that portion of help for the category. So basically it should say,"" here you go... a good waste of time. Take quizzes but you don't get to find out the answers for them unless you pay."" F your free trial you accepted. Because only the quizzes are free. Nothing else."
5,Pepper8969,"If you love playing many games after another or want to relax, this is an awesome app. The tests and quizzes are also fun. Just remember to go to an actual doctor and not diagnose yourself!"
5,_iSNOTNiCK_,"Great way to replace doom scrolling. Fun games, interesting quizzes, and easy to put down and come back to rather than getting pulled into the electronic void lol. Would highly recommend!"
5,Chickenfried,It has fun games that help you perform better mentally. I could spend hours on impulse and not get bored its fun to see how you compare to others in your age group.
5,..Kierrraaaaaa..,"I rarely leave reviews, but this app has been really good for me when it comes to unwinding and giving attention to activities that are beneficial for my brain."
5,Brittybobitty69,"I‚Äôm only on day two but I think it‚Äôs amazing. Its entertaining and it makes my brain feel smahhhht. Well not super smart yet, but knowing I‚Äôm at least average helps for the time being. Haha."
4,FNAF OTAKU,I‚Äôve not been playing very long but the games are engaging and versatile and genuinely helpful. The small bite sized segments you do each day keep it from getting overwhelming. There are plenty of badges you get as reward which is good motivation.
5,kkkhhh8,I‚Äôve enjoyed the app!! Lots of games to pick from and they become harder as one levels up. Glad to know I‚Äôm improving my brain while having funüéâ
4,Toe461,This game is so fun but you have to pay on some things but I really like it I have played for a month now and have learned so much this is the most relaxing game that I have played in my 15 years that I have been alive
5,ZiggyRicky,I‚Äôm starting to realize I need to work out the brain muscle. This is a fun way and I like the progression to harder problems as you move along.
5,Louieb_fit,It‚Äôs very stimulating. I can see where this can help prevent memory problems down the road as I get older. I‚Äôm in the health/wellness field and this app will be very beneficial to me and the clients I refer to it!
5,JeanieVan,"Great app.  You challenge yourself with a variety of games, and you get feedback on how you compare with others.  Let‚Äôs see how it advances my everyday performance, but so far, 5 stars!"
1,Baman AC,"In using the Free trial, I was offered a subscription (1yr) for $6.99, I accepted. However, the amount charged does Not reflect the advertised price. Additionally, prior to the 24-hr free trial, I‚Äôve cancelled my subscription. I‚Äôm can not Trust apps on Apple due to such deceptive and false ads.  Requesting Apple to remedy this situation. I want a full charge reversal/refund and the ‚Äúvendor‚Äù/‚Äúseller‚Äù/‚Äúdeveloper ‚Äú be sanction.  This has been a huge waste of my time."
5,Airsoftlobr,I love the quick few minutes it takes and that I am staying active in many different ways.
5,New York KC,"Unlike many other games, this one helps sharpen your skills in a multitude of tasks! Each game will have you using your brain to solve the puzzles. It‚Äôs so much fun!"
5,Our class,Just starting the free version and loving this app. Feels like it‚Äôll be exactly what I need to keep my mind sharp as I  age. I like that it‚Äôs got a lot of variety and it keeps your interest
5,Tracillia,"Honestly, the fact that I am learning something from it is just a plus! Better to get on here and train my brain than mindlessly scroll"
5,hunting the best,It keeps your brain sharp. You don‚Äôt have to get the subscription because the ads aren‚Äôt every minute. Also you get a lot of stuff for free. Love this game.
5,slimsdanna,This app has sooo many games and things to unlock. Definitely recommend trying it out over other brain games.
5,JanninePrice,I really like this app. The games are fun and the personality tests are fun as well.  I like the push notifications to let you know when it‚Äôs time to do your daily games.
5,VSüòÅ,"After my brain spending 10 hrs a day on my ‚Äúday job‚Äù, this app really keeps my brain stimulated in different area from what it is used to."
5,FaithNoelle97,"I‚Äôve been enjoying the app a ton so far, it‚Äôs only my second day but I do think it‚Äôs helping keep my mind more active through the day"
5,NikkiKim,This gives me something productive to do on my phone rather than mindlessly scrolling social media or any other time waster.
5,Chikezie Victor,Keeps my mind sharp while being on my phone instead of mindlessly scrolling on social media. A great way to start my morning
4,PuzzlesRMyLife2,I love this app but there need to be levels added to the games. i have run out on most. Been waiting a long time. I play on it every day. I feel it‚Äôs not updated enough for the more than casual user.
5,juiyv,If you wanting to improve you memory processing speeds whatever it may be this is the app for you
5,cristyü§óüòä,This app is absolutely amazing cause it actually helps train your brain and you can choose what you want to focus on to help.I couldn‚Äôt recommend anything better ‚ú®
5,muffinmaster72,It‚Äôs a must helps so much as long as you start slow and are consistent you will see a difference
5,#zi,I just had the opportunity to play and I really loved it because I could see my ability to focus and I have ADHD and I can improve a lot here. Thank you
5,DonutDuple1222,"I cant put my phone down, this is literally the most fun I‚Äôve had playing an app in YEARS. And I can tell I‚Äôm getting faster at the games and puzzles!"
5,Wendy_Jo,Funny little distraction throughout the day to keep your eyes and brain sharp. I like the diverse group of games each session vs. the redundant games. This game is for everyone. Just get it.
5,medicShelly,After suffering a TBI- my memory and attention have been greatly reduced. This game is more like fun and not a test.  So far so good.  I‚Äôm able to stay focused and find myself wanting to do more.
4,unlucky in love 2021,"If you know, then, you know this takes time and agility, which makes you focus on what you doing is tedious as well as intriguing but you‚Äôll enjoy what you‚Äôre doing"
5,Fireking226,It helps me work my brain and use logic and thinking skills. If I had the money I would most definitely pay for the full version
5,Collino888,Literally the most fun I‚Äôve had on a game in a very long time and helps me focus and concentrate when I keep getting distracted while doing homework
5,datkangel12,I like that my phone send is notification when I need to start brain training. The exercises are explained well and easy to follow.
5,killeermoode24,If you add this to a daily to do list along with other things to do you will definitely see more success in your life
5,Colorbee2005,I feel that playing brain games can help keep your brain thinking and challenge yourself to help you stay healthy!!
5,crusty boii,"A very nice game to keep you focused,at first I didn‚Äôt think that this game would be fun or interesting but when I played it, I ended up really enjoying it."
5,Adonissssssssss,I enjoy the daily brain exercises that continue to improve my skills daily. Impulse is very informative and easy to maneuver through the app activities. Thanks to the creators for Impulse!ll
5,ssamsclubb,"I‚Äôve never left a review for an app before but this is SOO fun, tracks your improvement, and also, if you‚Äôre competitive, you‚Äôll enjoy the comparison to your peers üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
5,pjm0220,Just started using the app and love it so far. Great way to spend some down time instead of playing a game or scrolling social media.
5,Reilly221,"Honestly really opening. I never get this much from an app, but it‚Äôs a mental opener for everyday and a 10/10 recommend that DOESN'T require a membership on download. Love it."
5,Jlar2000,Of all the brain training apps I‚Äôve tried this one is the best!! The games are simple and fun! And it‚Äôs also free!!!! You don‚Äôt have to pay to get all the games or anything like that!!!
1,joanna96r,I got this game because I saw an ad on Instagram. The game was for connecting the dots. I opened the game and I was so confused. I just wanted to play the connect the dots game where you have to connect two dots without overlapping. So annoying. I‚Äôm tired of these ads on Instagram that advertise a completely different game and when you download it it‚Äôs not what you thought it was going to be >:/
5,urmomhasspermbriws,It‚Äôs very fun and helpful with memory and math and I‚Äôve only had it for two days and it doesn‚Äôt force you to buy thing‚Äôs every five second
5,Lynettieo,I like that it changes to new game instead of playing the same thing over and over
5,X_Jc113_X,"I really found this app as something that I actually look forward to. It really has helped me with problem solving and more,"
5,In Growht,It‚Äôs a five out of 5 because it helps you with your brain and it helps you get smarter with growth and I think that‚Äôs right because it helps you get smarter by getting older
5,wills830,"This is a great app! There‚Äôs lot of ways to test and train the brain. Great variety of games to choose from, which includes a short daily ‚Äúworkout‚Äù of three games."
4,AntonioIsSoCool,This game is fun to do like once or twice throughout the day. Sometimes I find myself stuck to it and it‚Äôs not a bad app to be stuck on. Training my mind has always been on my mind and now I can finally do it.
5,Emmoly getsin,This game is really good I‚Äôm working with your brain and I love how you get to play different games to set your brain I never knew you could use games get better like really fun games
5,APPQueen0101,"This app is fun, engaging, and challenging. I enjoy knowing I am helping my brain. Since I send a lot of time on my phone I am glad to have this app. Thank you to the creators and maintainer of this app!"
5,CephalopodicArtist,Been looking for something like this forever. Really needed some small but plentiful puzzles to fill the gap in between sets while working out.
5,npav95,"Im so happy to have found impulse, I always look for games that challenge me and helps me to train and exercise my brain, if you‚Äôre like me about that this app is for you! Super recommended"
5,R.Melbelle,Hi.üòÄ All I can say about the app that it‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs called.  Whenever I have a minute. I just go on and do a couple games and enjoy it.  Sometimes I get stuck to it üòÅ but it‚Äôs great. You‚Äôll love it. Must get!!
5,Minecraft women,It has many different games. I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm playing the same thing over and over.
5,RockstarsOnIce,This is a fun app!  Different mind challenges.  Some easier than others but the purpose of getting you thinking is the goal and it is met!
5,Maukido,This app is the right amount of challenging to keep you on your toes but also adds an element of fun to keep you wanting to do it. I highly recommend it!
5,nnyabuizboi,It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs pretty chill overall you just play a couple of games and your done. My only issue is ads after every minute but other than it‚Äôs a 5/5
5,jorgevazquezt,So far so good. The task are fun and get more challenging with the time you play. This app is helping me to unwind after work and I hope it helps me to be more agile on decision maker.
5,Hollas Graham,Not everything is available but overall I enjoy the games. I feel my brain put to use! Will be purchasing most likely.
5,acm2022,I struggled with short term memory for awhile now. I have been doing the targeted memory games to work on it. It‚Äôs great! They are short and fun. I recommend this and my brain feels younger already! -acm2022
5,DelawareSmith3,I feel that after just a few days that my brain has become a little more active and I‚Äôm feeling a bit sharper and more focused.
5,queenrowen,A simple system with a variety of brain sharpening games that keep your thought process on point. Well done
4,Be Strong...Know God,Great. It has helped me relax when I‚Äôm in my deepest battles with anxiety. It changes my focus to something different other than my problems. Thank you!  (One thing. You do have to pay for certain things. Mainly free though!!)
5,Espo555,I just needed a daily game to keep my brain sharp. I‚Äôm a pretty busy girl but I like to play in my downtime. This is a great find! This game has been pretty fun so far! Looking forward to playing more.
5,Mr Kamado,"This app helps a lot with problem solving at it tests you on how fast you can solve because of the fact that it has time, and shows you‚Äôre IQ"
5,Eakat88,This ended up being a lot more enjoyable then I thought! I wish it was cheaper to own. But otherwise it‚Äôs a good app and has a nice amount of brain games.
5,KattU2309,I‚Äôve tried a few of these apps and this is by far my favorite. There‚Äôs a lot of variety and the games are straight forward and fun.
5,Sixtring87,Definitely noticed some things going more correctly in my head the next day after using the app.
4,Tsm_God*,I have this app four stars because it is a good mind game app and also if you want to play in again in the same day you have to pay other than that and the hardness this game is actually pretty good so download it
4,Mazatlan Layla,I love this. It is challenging and fun and I know it is not wasted time playing because it is keeping my reflexes sharp. I have read over and over since my last ‚Äúmilepost‚Äù birthday how important it is to keep your mind active and challenged.
5,BJ Passion,"The exercises are so much Fun! I enjoy that there‚Äôs daily exercises, along with options to play individual games and their levels, also personal testing for different topics"
5,TeKk $,"Hey I‚Äôm TeKk $, I started this game about a week ago.  With being only under the surface of the whit sharpening game, I already feel way more sharp and much like a brand new rubber band, snaps back with a quickness!"
5,Sahuggs,"I have severe memory issues at 47, and the games help you to focus, force you to think critically, and all of the games are so diverse. This is the best thing I‚Äôve downloaded this year!!"
5,GerryFromTheBlock,"I was briefly mad that I got so little for free, then I was addicted, paid for it, and now I feel the price is extremely reasonable. I don‚Äôt spend money on games, so that‚Äôs saying something."
5,Karolee1,Good mental exercises. I see people struggle with memory loss and loss of mental sharpness. Some of it can be diagnosed but much of it is just due to lack of mental training. (Becoming brain couch potatoes!) This is easy exercise for the brain!
5,D3V2018,"No cluttered with ADs, multiple brain puzzles to choose from. Nicely organized. The reporting is fun especially if you are competitive. Really enjoying this app."
3,Danse,"Fun games, fun app: does not track progress properly at all. I‚Äôve been playing everyday for 20 days in a row ‚Äî has reset the streak 3x and once said I played 23 days straight??? Also, I‚Äôll complete a game for the day and it lists no games completed. Frustrating!  Otherwise, so far I‚Äôve enjoyed this app."
5,Oh yeah777,"I haven‚Äôt used it for long, but compared to other brain game apps I‚Äôve tried, Impulse is up there. High quality and unique games."
5,pmiketich,"Really enjoy the challenge of this app.  I like the fact that it always update to new versions, new games.   Highly recommend"
5,gctjvc,So far this is amazing I just started today and it‚Äôs not just fun and takes your mind off the world it helps my hands and brain not pull my eyelashes
5,Tiger lily love,I enjoy Impulse for the brain challenges and personality tests. Impulse is a much better use of my time than mindless scrolling on social media.
5,brito86,Downtime at work calls for this great brain game. Way better than scrolling through social media. Helps with focus!!
5,Boinky123,Help me improve my ability to think and reason. Improve my problem solving both in mathematical and analytical perspective. It is very entertaining
5,Bubbles-1971,I feel validated that my brain is functioning properly. I‚Äôve had a TBI and often have concerns with that there are long term effects. I‚Äôm his app helps me build confidence.
5,Wicked white widow,So far so good Went ahead and bought the one year subscription figured it couldn‚Äôt possibly hurt
4,Cvdc,"First, I do enjoy the app so much stuff to do. I try to keep up my streaks. BUT when I thumbs down an activity I don‚Äôt want to play it and I feel like I see it even more. Stop forcing me to do math. Thank you."
5,abbylovesGOD13,"I like that there are explanations that can even be replayed and rewatched as needed. After the practice, there are games that let you exercise your memory and reaction time to complete the task."
4,Lalam1731,I like everything else except the fact that I have to pay & at least make the free trial a week if users have to payü´§
5,Mnrod96,The one word I best describe this app. The customizability to fit your needs and schedule is what sets this app apart. Very fun and addicting. I look forward to competing and keeping my streak alive the next day.
1,Camilsh20,"I purchased a subscription because I enjoyed the app. Upon getting busy and no longer using the app, I cancelled my subscription. NOW I KEEP GETTING CHARGED EVERY MONTH!! I have followed instructions, I have cancelled the auto renewal through my AppleID account, I sent an email to support‚Ä¶ I would have liked to give a good review for the app itself but this is a major problem."
5,HowBoutNowBrownCow,Definitely delivers! I can already see a difference in the way my brain works the more I train it. I hope I can convince everyone I know to try this game.
1,Cori10193,"This app is called Impulse for a reason. They offer you so many discounts to encourage you to pay for a year subscription, eventually I did.  This is the kind of app you use once and forget about. The ads the have online are nothing like the actual app.   And the best part is this purchase is non refundable. I just wasted $30 on this piece of junk app."
5,Webexfan2017,"I am enjoying it so far. It‚Äôs simple yet challenging. U think that you figured it out, to quickly learn that you need to pay attention."
5,Tommybishop,Just started a couple of days ago but so far has been fun and seems to help me stay focused once finished. Will continue to use daily.
5,Little Aj 7913,"I really like all of the different games, tests, categories and options they have. Also the price is low and affordable"
5,adri1$,I love playing this because it enhances my capabilities! It makes you think and give your confidence as well. Highly recommend this app.
5,Azzy820,"I love this game because it gets my mind out of every day living all while strengthening my mind as well, indifferent areas. I needed this."
5,merloju,Great app for those of us older folks who want to keep our mind and memory sharper. I would definitely recommend!
5,CrazyBusyMommaOf3,"Super fun and a warm fuzzy whe. They let you know that your doing well and perhaps better than many others on your age group.   So far, as of day 2, I am really enjoying it"
5,Stacie B.,"I absolutely love this app, I do it in the morning with my coffee and it‚Äôs a great way to get my brain firing.  I see the areas that need improving and I feel good knowing I‚Äôm being proactive in helping my ADHD symptoms."
5,Tbird0101,I don‚Äôt know if this actually scientifically helps but it‚Äôs kinda fun and I enjoy doing all the puzzles and quizzes. I recommend. Especially if you can get an epic deal on it.
5,AddyLongmont,I can def see the difference in my comprehension and memory after using for only a week.
4,zoeg0702,It‚Äôs helping me learn and stay focused and I need that for the academic achievements I have . It‚Äôs very fun and helpful because I got and A+ at school because I remember the study questions thanks to Impluse.
5,TMYounger,"I look forward to the brain trainings each morning. I‚Äôve just begun, so I‚Äôll come back with an update."
5,bj110279,"It‚Äôs like every other app unless you buy stuff, there will always be adds. But besides that fun app. I feel smarter every time I do it"
5,joshuawedekind,"Impulse really helps calm my brain from Math problems, to word puzzles, to really anything you might need to take your mind off the world for a mind and relax! Impulse is the app for you!!"
5,tinkmetpan,This app is just brilliant and I love using it when I get bored or when I feel I need to catch up on some impulse! You either like it or don‚ÄôtüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è
5,souldevourer101,"I like the game but the only downside is that nowadays you have to pay a subscription to access other games, spots, etc. Great game though in my opinionüëç"
3,Daddy Schlonglegz,The games and puzzles are good and definitely entertaining but the amount of ads and the short interval of time in between the ads and the game is to short. They do this on purpose to make you want to buy the pro edition to eliminate ads but that‚Äôs scummy.
5,halftoad,App does make you use your brain and really think about each game you‚Äôre playing. I can feel my IQ going up as I type this out.
1,LightGuide93,"I got the 3 day free trial did the initial tasks, woohoo your 90+% Better than your peers at playing simple games!   Doubtful, it further increases my doubt that you use a 92% off after in the form of a ‚ÄúRandom chance‚Äù gift ad   You‚Äôve locked testing for personality types behind a paywall when anyone could easily search a free personality test online and get the same results, while there at it they should check out the bartle player types as well and learn what kind of player they are.   To increase your cognitive function go read, write, script, learn a new skill, this seems lack luster and money grubbing at best. But you guys do you."
1,SPAMStillSucks,"After paying for this subscription for a year and a week into playing, popup ads are now promoting other apps. The games and puzzles are very repetitive, and I've found several errors in the answers. Very disappointed and i would not recommend purchasing this app."
5,#CKSolution,This game allows you to think quickly therefore it helps you to bring decisions to the forefront of your mind‚Ä¶
1,JayyT09,"There are ads every single time I go to the next round. They are NOT spaced out accordingly.  It only takes a few seconds to complete a level and then BOOM, an ad that‚Äôs worth a minute or two long! If there‚Äôs an ad at least every 10 levels or so then I can tolerate that. But after one level each????  Such a waste of my time and so not worth it."
5,DespinaCherie22,I enjoy exercising my brain üß† with the games & challenges. It‚Äôs better than mindless scrolling (which can be fun too) all the time. It‚Äôs good balance.
5,Zayy415,"Keeps you productive mentally, it is impossible to be bored and/or unchallenged. Plenty of games leave you brain dead,, this App leaves u the ultimate opposite while being fun! Very happy this App existsüèåüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•Ç"
2,homicidepiinksÓÑΩ,Before the ads I would use this app daily. Then they added the ads and now I can‚Äôt even THINK about using this app. The ads are excessive and on top of that they‚Äôre long. It gave me anxiety. Only way to use comfortably is with paying a ridiculous amount. It‚Äôs giving very much greedy energy.
5,Iwatchtoomuchnaruto,Impulse is a thought provoking app that can challenge your mind and help you with focus. Additionally it has iq tests that you can just do on your phone. Really 5/5
5,Favorite finds,This app is fun and makes you use parts of your brain you haven‚Äôt used in a while thank for the wonderful app
5,xeroninja,"Hi I‚Äôm Becca and I like it it‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs confusing, so can you fix that? I am trying to get good but it‚Äôs confusing again,"
5,NJackson05,This app seems easy to operate and easy to understand. Games are straightforward and fun. Overall a great experience so far
5,Slim-ily,"Daily games are quick and easy but the tests for personality type, adhd, anxiety and procrastination type are really interesting"
5,durgigl,After only a couple of days I am already noticing changes in brain activity.
3,B_r_i_d_g_e_t_h_,The app seems really cool until you spend 10 minutes on a quiz and then it tells you you need to pay to unlock results. I understand things aren‚Äôt free but be upfront before a user starts an activity.
1,Celia71,"I read reviews of this & gave it the trial, which was just ok, but never authorized beyond for the insanity of the $7 per WEEK fee, nor did I receive the ad free version that I was charged for. I maxed out 2 levels of the games within that timeframe which never update amidst the barrage of freezing up unclosing ads. There is better out there without scammers"
1,jclyonsmama17,"I signed up for a free trial and before the trail was even over, they took a weekly payment out. I tried to dispute this with Apple and they are not refunding my money. An app to help people‚Äôs mental health has a confusing pay system and then steals from the same people.  Update: I was happy to see the game responded to my review in hopes of a resolution but all they commented was #N/A. Zero help and still no refund."
5,SB Addicted,"Love this app!!  Not only is it fun but I actually see improvements in my focus, memory and mental processing speed. I recommend it to anyone looking to stay sharp and enjoys challenging themselves!"
5,RalphyPolo,"Games and improvements in brain functions are a green light from me. Fun, challenging, can observe progress, enough data points to figure out something‚Äôs about yourself. Love it."
4,$h‚Ä¶,"Although it‚Äôs a good game, I dislike the amount of ads had. Every time you win two rounds an ad pops up. Even when you leave the game you have to watch an ad."
5,Bitemybootie,I suffer from fibromyalgia which causes memory and cognitive deficits. After playing these games I have discovered that my brain is functioning better than I thought! So motivating!!!
5,Lizkea,I love these games especially as a day break from social media and other distractions. It also helps me calm my mind and brain before going to sleep.
5,Jamebroo,The games are fun and start out slow so you can work yourself up to more difficult games!
5,Noli nuggy,"I have only been on this app for, like, two days and I already love it! I have recommended it to a few people already! This is not a robot review. I really like it"
5,Imperfect angel2004,Seems helpful I like that it shows my progress against others it makes me feel better

5,fdan4824,Simple games to work on memory. Games can be completed quickly and not take a lot of time.
5,The Punkin Wood,"I enjoy impulse immensely as being that we age much faster than we want, it is refreshing to have an app that also rejuvenates your mind!! 5 stars!!"
3,cajetane,"Why does this app not keep correct count of the games I complete? It seems totally random as to whether it keeps score or not, no matter whether I use the buttons to leave the game or it times out. Seriously annoying."
5,kimberlya777,This app has so many fun games that appeals to any age. It‚Äôs fun and trains your brain to adapt to a better way of thinking. I recommend to anyone who wants to strengthen their cognitive skills.
2,hilvca,The Candy Sort game makes me redo levels I‚Äôve already completed if I leave the app and reopen it. It‚Äôs really frustrating. Otherwise enjoy the app and games.  Updating‚Ä¶I cancelled my subscription because of the repeating levels. Makes the game frustrating instead of relaxing.
5,JayeHoward,I‚Äôm definitely enjoying the Impulse app! It offers great challenges and is great for a refresher on subjects/topics I haven‚Äôt had to use in a while.  Its helping me to relax as I wind down for the night too!!!
3,Anither fraudulant game,"Impulse is a pretty good brain training game. Although I think that the individual, mini games are a little bit on the easy side. I would like it even more, if they were made a tad bit more challenging‚Ä¶ Pretty good game, though. I will continue to utilize this app to SHARPEN  my mind, EVERY day, Unless o FORGET to‚Ä¶"
5,ndjdhdkanf,"I was surprised at how engaging this app is. The puzzles are fun and they can be a challenge at higher levels. Overall, worth the money for the subscription"

4,Idk üíÄüêç,"It‚Äôs helping me focus a lot and stay connected, I‚Äôve noticed how when you take a test you have to pay to see the full document and I‚Äôm not too happy about that but it‚Äôs a pretty good app"
1,Sebastien666,"Nothing but advertisements. I signed up for free trial and IMMEDIATELY cancelled it but APPLE decided they would go ahead and try to charge my card and now I cannot buy ANYTHING or update anything from the App Store!! I just went through this 3 weeks ago!!! Apple has completely been run into the ground and is a terrible, greedy company whom I used to adore! I‚Äôve had every iPhone but iPhone 5!! But I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE EVIL, GREEDY FRAUDSTERS!!!"
4,Zeeeds,"Its been 2 days since i have downloaded impulse and i must say its great but i dont think i m still ready to give it a 5 stars not because it lacks in any segment,I simply havent tried all of it yet"
5,Patrolin2k,It‚Äôs been along time song I‚Äôve enjoyed a game of any sort. I really enjoy this game. The math portion makes me laugh because I really need to think about the order of operations.
5,YungChop,I‚Äôm new to it so I like it so far I want to see the difficulty increase throughout the days as well as it keeping track on if I‚Äôm bettering in areas
5,ChristianPress,"This app offers a robust catalog of brain training games and puzzles, and also many quizzes to test you in many areas of cognitive function"

5,Limbusa,Just started a few days ago. The variety of challenges is impressive and it keeps me motivated.
5,ChrisF522,Fun and sometimes challenging games to keep your brain sharp. Also a bonus that the games in the ad are actually the ones you play.
5,Thenikksmeister,"So hopefully it actually does help memory and focus, but overall at least all the games are fun. I paid for a year so I still have to see if it helps regain mental acuity"
5,Harmione4ever,"Being recommended by a TikTok ad, it might be good or horribly bad. This app was neither. In the first five minutes it was great! It was fun and tested your brain! It‚Äôs a great app and I definitely recommend"
5,Juju bean nuber one,I love their little challenges that they have and how if you need help in certain subjects you choose it and it will help you to learn

5,Kaila_Fay,"So far, so good. I have anxiety so I really like the basicness of the game. No loud noises or too much going on. Just enough to throw my eyes off, but not enough to send my anxiety soaring through the roof."
5,Sadie and zoeys mom,Like I‚Äôve downloaded games before and deleted the app within 10 minutes . I actually like this impulse thing !!!!!! It‚Äôs challenging! In a great way .
5,LU469#1,Especially when you know you are making progress in strengthening the mind
5,Butycheeks,These games actually teaches you to allow yourself to think and play and it keeps the mind woke at all times

5,1volt28,"I enjoy everything about this app! If I‚Äôm feeling tired, I do one of the activities to help me get the rest of my work done. I really like the iq part!"
1,William Killian,I enjoyed the app so I purchased the no ads within one game for $4.99. I then started playing another game but noticed there were ads after the first game. It‚Äôs disingenuous to have it cost $4.99 to remove ads for less than 5% off your application. I‚Äôm extremely baffled by this bait and switch without explicitly stating it‚Äôs only for the single game.
5,gdhgdhhfdcjjfxv,It‚Äôs a really good app just wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay as much !!! But really helpful and challenging so if that‚Äôs what you are looking for you should definitely buy !!!

What a scam and what a exploiter you are canceled canceled canceled."

5,lmduquec,This app is the best choice that I made because sometimes I just want to entertainment but this is the best way to do it and also help me to improved my skills.
1,MizMoonbeam,"I love the idea of this app, but I couldn‚Äôt do much with the free trial to even see if it was worth paying for. The test I wanted to take, which was advertised to get you to try the app, wouldn‚Äôt even let me see the results after I‚Äôd already signed up and agreed to pay after the free trial ended. You had to pay for results even under a ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial."
5,meeshi51,I‚Äôm only a few days in but I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. I‚Äôve been looking for a app that will push my mind again as I‚Äôm getting older and I love it
5,whatthehellboi,"As someone with ADHD who struggles with remembering math problems and stuff like that this helps me a lot.  I love sorting out colors in different jars, memorizing patterns, and a lot more. This app couldn‚Äôt get any better!!"
4,James L L,"Even after my first time , I could feel the parts of my brain were being worked! The next day was even better! Thanks for this app!"

5,Bustervana,So far I‚Äôm impressed with what I‚Äôve seen. I have also noticed that after only one day my brain feels like it is waking up.
5,bbh20polo,I‚Äôve been using the app for only a few days and can already feel the difference. It‚Äôs like candy snacks for the brain!! Love it!
5,M&M üåÆ,This game is so fun and you should definitely download it! It has so many different games to play and the premium cost is only 28$ a year! Even without the premium it‚Äôs super fun!!
5,nono hjiko philipenes,"Impulse is such an amazing app that is not only fun, but also mentally stimulating. It has taught me so much about myself. Do wish the weekly was a little cheaper, but I can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt worth it."
5,Simkets,It really makes you focus and gets the mind off everything else. Helps with memory and concentration. Recommended it for my mom too
5,Daly 22,"I am enjoying this. It is easy to use and provides with this statement, make you feel confident, no matter what level you are."

5,carly01nn,I love the variety of brain exercises to keep my brain sharp. As we age keeping a great memory together can be challenging. I‚Äôm hoping that things will improve
5,SDRAMZ,Most other apps are the same dull tests but this is something new and different. Give it a try!
2,Jodymancody,"The app itself is a good idea, but without paying a yearly membership all the game and quiz results are locked behind a pay wall. I feel like games like these if they were free would do so much better and they could collect revenue from another source."
5,Catlady01327,I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but I love this game it really helps work your mind and focuses on the area you want to work on ! I love puzzles and challenges so it‚Äôs definitely worth it
5,Tori2023!,I just started this app and I really feel like this is going to help train my brain on my memory and retaining ! Can‚Äôt wait how I‚Äôll feel in a month

5,haughtharper,This game is so great! It makes you use your brain and exercise it. This will help my memory problems also! I would recommend this for anyone!!
5,AH-1254,This app trains your brain daily as low as 3 games. Each morning I wake up ready to start my day with an educational program that is so fun and challenging!
5,Bdoll1821,I have two days using this app and I love it it actually really helps me get my brain to exercise areas I usually don‚Äôt do as a stay at home mom
5,Billy 011,Ready makes you focus and practice sharpening your mind. Games are fun and not overly hard. Helps take your mind off all the bull crap going on in your life.

5,ShariJJ,Easier than I expected but gives my brain a much needed workout
5,IMRJ27,"Unlike most apps, even the free version is a great time. I got this app to stay sharp and to improve my strategic thinking and it‚Äôs improved by leaps and bounds"

5,Bam915,"Definitely helps keep my brain going, plus it‚Äôs helping me stay off of social media during this detox. Great way to spend your spare time."
5,pot and water,I got to say this has been helping me a lot  and I keep getting better every day so thank you impulse for helping me I really appreciate it
5,mkanatzer,I absolute love these kind of games and puzzles  But I can‚Äôt handle the f‚Äôn adds and I‚Äôm not paying 40$ to remove the adds that‚Äôs cost to much money. Soo time to delete your game
5,CharmingCharley,I love this game so much because it helps my brain grow and it‚Äôs a fun thing to do when I‚Äôm bored I definitely recommend this game! I never had any problems
4,maks10111,Fun and good warmup to the day. I like the idea of the app. But when I bought the free trial I got none of the perks. I did the personality test and it kept trying to get me to buy the yearly and monthly plans when I already had the free trial. I‚Äôm wondering why that is
4,011001111010,"I think this app is great to give it a try. It has OK puzzles and mini games for you to play but if you don‚Äôt pay for it, you have a lot of low budget ads. But overall I‚Äôm satisfied with it."
5,Espinjaie,I am able to keep myself busy while also making my brain work and I love it
5,Thugadoug,Fun better then a lot of these repetitive games this  keeps it refreshing and new you never know what your gonna get when you log in.
5,Meggie balze,"The games nice tho,just that it contains a purchase where you‚Äôll have to subscribe either monthly or yearly and not everyone can do that. But apart from it the apps the best."
5,RK63839,"This is the first app I actually wanted to do review for. It‚Äôs really fun and entertaining while actually helping your brain, problem solving, & critical thinking!   Really enjoy it!"
5,notbri3,"This app is great! You‚Äôre able to test your iq, play stimulating brain games, and track your progress along the way. I‚Äôve been having so much fun with it!"
5,willieop,Makes your brain wake up and actually work instead of steadily wasting time and effort watching someone else do the work
5,pies&shoes,Thought I should brush up on my skills.  It‚Äôs been a minute since I was challenged so thought why not give it a try. So far I don‚Äôt have any issues
5,ArtgirlA√ºra,Honestly the most fun I‚Äôve had playing games in years - gets me right to the edge of my seat & makes me competitive in the most positive way. Very visually pleasing & always leaves me wanting more
5,bonnie71V,I like the variety of games and challenges this app offers! So much fun . I Just got started but can‚Äôt wait to see improvements!
5,LowerBobs18,"It started off pretty easy but now it‚Äôs getting more intense with every level. Definitely a great way to get  my brain sharper, especially at the my age. Need to get back to par with my A game."
5,Paul Garrett3,"I didn‚Äôt know what to think upon finding this app, but I‚Äôve come to enjoy it. Some of the games or tasks seem mundane at times, but it‚Äôs a fun cognitive exercise. I‚Äôd say give it a try!"
1,DallasBoy88,The games are enjoyable but loaded with ads. Eventually you will see the option to pay $4.99 to get rid of ads on the game. This is extremely misleading because most people would assume that it would remove ads throughout the entire app but it actually only removes ads from the specific game you are playing. Pretty scummy tactic of you ask me.
4,pineapple0814,"I love this app I just wish there was a little more variety, and sure you can have more if you pay. :( But for free still quite a bit of games that can keep me busy. Also love the math reviews helps me remember!"
5,Chibi!2,Pretty good too ok kill time and helps you in other things that you need help with through out the day
5,PennyWize ik,Impulse is a really good app it helps improve your IQ and it has test for u and puzzles. It does have a lot of adds but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really effect any thing. I really recommend this app
5,@nc.nightman,"This app allows you to be challenged everyday even if you‚Äôre very busy, take a few minutes of your time and train your brain"
5,Keyly22,"With barely a day already with using this game, it self explanatory, then again some seem like it‚Äôs challenging but solve it anyways. So definitely GOOD in general!"
5,DYEHFD,"I just started using this a couple days ago, but it definitely works your mind. We will see if it has any long term advantage."
5,caralaalaa,"Totally obsessed! Love this app and the many, many options it has. Love being challenged and they always have something new to try. Very, very pleased with my purchase!"
5,PMacStrong,"Gets me away from social media, while still being able to decompress but use my brain at the same time."
5,Sharon 1985,I am loving the variety of games and how short they are. I can pop in for a mental change of pace and pop out easily.   Thank you!
5,Wg2017!,"One of the best purchases I have ever made in the App Store. The variety of games and puzzles keeps you entertained for hours, truly. I am addicted in only the first few days!"
4,Nivea1223,"When your brain is declining this game is a great way to exercise your chops. Also, if you do a lot of waiting in line or waiting at doctors offices, instead of complaining or getting upset, play this game and keep your good mood."
4,Bowl-her,Changes my thinking pattern by exercising my mind.  It also relaxes me‚Ä¶. No stress; I do it at my own pace and progress as I move along.   Thank you for making it so much fun and easy to help my memory and thinking skills.
5,Jawaiian Jam,"This game really tests you on being focused, and also tests you on your memory. This will probably help you on preventing you on memory loss and being distracted."
5,HotTammili,I definitely enjoy doing these brain workouts for 10 mins everyday. It definitely helps keep your mind sharp and going.
5,Zhavjlen,I absolutely love this app and enjoy testing all aspects of my brain. My memory can be really bad at times and I don‚Äôt do anything in my personal life to practice and train.
1,Wrecknology ,You can‚Äôt play the game without accepting the trial. I played the trial and decided to Pay for the Lifetime subscription. After paying for the lifetime subscription I was still getting charged for the weekly subscription. Which the app did not override nor give me notification to cancel the weekly subscription.
5,Pre-Flop,"This first episode I played was pretty cool. Three puzzles, all timed very reasonably and graphically very nice. Took me a second to catch up on the third puzzle but still, this was a lot of fun to play."
4,SerpentQueen88,"I have only used Impulse for a couple of days so far , it has really helped me get back to the basics as I am refreshing my brain and cognitive skills.   It‚Äôs free and thought provoking. Highly recommend!"
5,EmmyNominated33,"As someone who has diagnosed ADHD, this app has helped me significantly with paying closer attention. I don‚Äôt as many careless mistakes. & I absolutely love the sorting games. I‚Äôm so happy I found this app!"
1,Laitherial,"Incessant pop-up notifications throughout the day which cannot be disabled. In fact, they won‚Äôt let you to use the app without clicking to allow for notifications.  I got these alerts before ever registering or trying the app. Put me off completely. I can‚Äôt imagine how excessive they‚Äôd be once I actually began using it. Pass."
5,Katie Saladin,This is not only getting me to replace doom scrolling on social media but also works my brain. I honestly feel like over time this will help make me mentally stronger!
4,Michellemoolah,"I do love this app. The games, the daily puzzles, all of it. But the ads that brought me to download the app presented certain personality tests that do not actually exist in the app (child trauma test was one)."
5,demon777,I enjoy that I can use this app for a few minutes a day to sharpen my skills and assess my development.
5,If I e,Keeps the mind focus and gives a easy challenge. Not frustrating at all.
5,Karendipity33,"Having ADD and OCD can make my brain feel very overwhelmed sometimes. This app, and its many brain training games, really calms me down and helps me get that energy out."
5,Racerbabe02,Beginning with small tasks and getting my problem solving  going in the morning is a great way to start my day
5,Miss_Bugg,I had no intention of buying this but before the first day free trial was over I ended up loving it and purchasing the year long subscription. 10/10
5,Hank a12b,"I play Luminosity which I enjoy. However, this app makes me work harder because it forces me to respond quickly to increase my score."
5,The Shay BayBee,I hate that we have to pay for everything good for us even the grand food we have to pay more for sheeeeesh
5,Fu$vu5kk,This app is soooo amazing with my adhd they are so smart with helping us but the problem is that the charge is too overpriced for people who actually need it but can‚Äôt afford it.
5,happymomma21,J like this app it is good to refresh my brain function because the things i do all day at work are very repetitive and dont challenge my brain!
5,bertone6565,I have adhd attention has always been my issue! But this app has helped me so much ! Great mind games! Not easy but it works!
5,Errrka!789,"I love exercising my brain, and these mini games have definitely helped. I‚Äôm even able to see where I can grow mentally"
5,Sean brown117,Great update on the lag with some of the games final moves! Makes a huge difference in my enjoyment of the app.
5,cjqnkxnq,I have been trying to find ways to help myself with my memory and I feel like this game will help!
5,Hdjfyjfsssss,I‚Äôm cognitive impaired and the app challenges my ability to retain short term information.  I recently started using the app and feel more comfortable  and confident.
5,OgoJag,"I have only just started to use this app, and I already feel the difference. Love the games and variety of things to do."
4,Blueskiess101,I usually dont write reviews but I‚Äôm so glad that I have this app. I use this app FIRST thing in the morning instead of scrolling on social media. It helps me start the day and I appreciate it. Ads are annoying but its a good game!
5,Jai.G87,I‚Äôm currently on the trial phase but so far the games are so fun and keep my interest that I find it a bit hard to put down
2,Pup73,"Games are decent but it‚Äôs hard to get into a rhythm because there are so many ads. I get they need ads to help pay for a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app. but when the ads are longer than the games themselves and pop up after every single level, that‚Äôs just too much for me it‚Äôs not worth it even for free."
5,H Simone,"So far, this app has been so much fun! I love the little games and tests! I think I‚Äôve actually learned a lot about myself in a very little amount of time! Bravo!"
4,luckylady412,Why would you move the restart button with the undo button? I‚Äôve played 200+ games on candy sort and now have to retrain to NOT hit that button. üò°
5,Andrew Wilk,I couldn‚Äôt find anything to hold my attention and challenge my way of thinking. I found that in this app.
5,TreasuredDreams,Only downside is how they try to get you to pay 30$ cause you ‚Äúwon‚Äù the chance game and now the offer is 92% off or something.
3,Valley008,"The app overall is entertaining but ive noticed that some of example games or tests in the ads arent available in the app. Even with a full paid subscription. For example, where‚Äôs the ink blot test to identify trauma i get served over and over. A little misleading."
4,OfficialMacMan,3 day free trial but you basically gotta pay for it to know any test results. Put it big bold letters LIMITED FREE TRIAL (will not have full access to all features of the app) because if it was stated I skipped over it pretty easily and I‚Äôd love to know where it says it at
5,Gary 2004,I honestly love this game I thought i was so bad at everything but it told me i did better the _% of people and i relised i was to hard on myself and the games are really fun
5,The Cheesecake Guy,"Working from home can be such a mundane task and boring. This app challenges me to keep my brain sharp, keep me alert and thinking!! It has helped me gain traction in my daily life and focus!"
5,Nickname was,This app is great but why is there adds for the game this shouldn‚Äôt interfere with the gameplay and the game should have more. choices to choose from
5,Weegee13,"This is fun!! But I‚Äôm biting my nails‚Ä¶.just to make sure I‚Äôm doing well. Yes, this is fun. There are several different games to play. Or should I say tests to solve. Just quick ones. They‚Äôre great honestly!"
5,Luvmur99,I‚Äôm on my free trail but so far the problems and puzzles are easy to follow and it gets challenging the more levels you pass but it verall it goes by your personal pace
5,Drayton sizzle,Payment after payment took a 40 Q test just for the end to be a $7 weekly fee to see my results bogus asl don‚Äôt recommend üëéüèΩ
5,User 3019620,"Safe and healthy games to not only enjoy, but also make your memory, thinking speed, precision, etc. better!"
5,Chells Wells,I‚Äôm finding this as a nice way to maintain and build my brain skills.  I want to always be able to keep up w/ with my kids in terms of my neuro health.
5,_carmencadena_,I find some games fairly easy - and some quite challenging. But to know that I‚Äôm helping my brain stay in shape is really something!!!
5,‚Ä¶MRS‚Ä¶,They were not wrong when they said they have a variety of brain teasers. Not only is it fun it can be quite challenging at times.
5,Maiah Your moms House,"It helped with my anxiety and my bad memory and it also is really relaxing if you have anxiety,hard time not staying focused you should download it"
5,lorna poi,Directions are easy to understand and read.
5,E.M.12,"This is by far the best brain exercising app! Very fun, not too long or drawn out. The perfect amount of challenge and very fun! My kids love to play it, too! I highly recommend."
5,OGB-,So I was a bit on edge as I didn't know what was actually happening but after my 7 day streak I realized I was actually having a blast with it
5,MVMike,I enjoy these little brain games in morning to get my brain going. I also am interested in the stats of others in my age group.
5,fullerherd,"Playing this game is, not only fun, but it stimulates and exercises your mind at the same time. It challenges your metal capabilities and if you like competition‚Ä¶it has that too!!"
5,Gizmo7416,I like to keep my brain going by learning new things and refreshing old things as well. This game is awesome and does just what I like to do. Keep my brain sharp.
5,pensilvanja,I love this app because for me I just have many problems with math and sorting this but this app helped my brain function faster than usual
5,hmitauer,I like using this app for training and learning how to see objects and not jump to fast trying to solve problems.
5,Loopyboxcar,I‚Äôm thankful for the brain training games. They cover all progress and reports to see how ur brain works each test in this app. Deanna
5,Eureka PACU RN,Super fun thing to do in between tasks or when waiting somewhere. Makes me feel smart and  more productive than scrolling on social media.
5,Happy girl Ukrainian,I have just started but I already love it. Because there are many things to train and many levels. Thank you the team who creates whose games üôèüëç
3,MikeMTX23,"This is a pretty well tool to use and it has its fun bits.  The training lessons focus on individual traits such as, peripheral vision, memory and other things such as math etc.  However instead of ad being after your morning lessons they slap them right in the middle of each on lasting enough time for you to lose all focus. Including the personal $15/Year offer. If you‚Äôre not paying you aren‚Äôt allowed to focus on the lessons without being interrupted in between.  Love the idea of this tool, however."
5,Nfran,"Purchased the yearly plan, really happy with the games so far! Enjoying this compared to doom scrolling or watching pointless videos! Thank you to the creators!"
5,shikhakhannag,"The think the interface is very good, the activities are fun and a break from work . And training the brain is a plus ."
5,Psilovehoran,Even if you don‚Äôt buy the features it‚Äôs still fun and it really helps. I hope more features become free or that they keep it this free cause it‚Äôs great
5,blessmeJesus22,It‚Äôs worth it. Worth you‚Äôre while and good price. If you‚Äôre going to be on your phone to kill some time use it for this! Help your brain. Get this
5,Ajay the Trans Guy,It‚Äôs only day two but so far it‚Äôs help with work stress and being at home. I‚Äôll leave a more better review after a month !
5,Abby_b03,I really love this app. I‚Äôm in my 20s and I enjoy the games. They really challenge me and get my brain juices pumping. It‚Äôs fun and much better and much better than playing candy crush:)
5,lej1227,"Really, I have noticed a sharper thought process since starting ‚Äúplaying‚Äù this app.  Recommend it just to reactivate skills that might be falling off."
4,Becca-Ray,"Only had it for two days now and I am I like it because I come out 99%, 90%, 80%. I can come out very high percent head of my peers and makes me feel good about myself plus it helps my peripherals."
1,Andy-rev,"First few days are too easy. Then the game gets WAY too hard and squeezes you with time for a round. There should be some sliders to adjust the difficulty and time cuz the game just becomes more frustrating than challenging. Also, the rating is misleading and not based on real data. SCAM for the money they are asking."
5,#MomBrain,Love Impulse! Games are fun and there is such a variety that you don‚Äôt get bored doing the same ones over and over!
5,Maryen 23,Let‚Äôs you know where you are at in certain categories and let‚Äôs you practice and improve your skills
5,joeybabes,"Great app for killing time and getting something in return, instead of scrolling through social media apps, use this!"
1,Linn's Garden Decor,The puzzles are somewhat interesting. Then you get the same stupid ad every couple minutes! Sometimes the app will have ads stuck on and won‚Äôt go off until you uninstall and reinstall! Fake new user installs!!! I‚Äôm going to find similar individual games and uninstall this once more ü§Æ
5,Kurtisha Brister,"Happy to have gotten the yearly subscription. I trust this app. This feels better than random game apps, that may or may not be stealing information."
5,Lela Kurtz,As you stop using certain skills it helps to use these type of puzzles to increase your memory and math skills
5,alsj2014,Games are targeted to specific skills. It‚Äôs been helpful to figure out which skills I need to work on and improve by playing these games. Great app!
1,Rpops36,"I canceled the free trial upon downloading the game I do this, so I‚Äôm not stuck in a subscription. If I like it, then I choose to start the plan however, again I canceled the subscription right when I download it and you charged me anyways, you should not be charging clients first of all if you allow a free trial period. Fraudulent ! I wouldn‚Äôt pay close to $30 for an app that‚Äôs insane."
5,Laurenlee29,"Fun, easy, quick way to feel like your doing something healthy for you mind with out having to do a cross word puzzle everyday."
5,Zachias88,BETTER. I love kill time with a fun game on the toilet or when ever I‚Äôm waiting on other at work. Now i can do the same thing while improving brain function!!!
5,KenzieDay,"This is an amazing game, you definitely should try it, it really helps improve and sharpen your mind. I wish I got this a long time ago!"

5,(_No_Name_),"Wow! I really enjoy this app. I like that it has brain games, and tests to figure out yourself. It‚Äôs really fun, and there‚Äôs daily practices so you can exercise your brain everyday! Great job, developers üòÅ"
5,mom23gurls,I like playing these brain games. They help to calm my very active brain when I am overstimulated. I can zone out and concentrate on the game and tune out the craziness of whatever is going on.
5,Two Cent Cali,"I‚Äôm enjoying this program because it‚Äôs a fun way to test your memory and mental sharpness.  At the same time, the quizzes help exercise parts of your brain."
4,Charlie Mo,With all the apps available that only waste time this is a refreshing alternative to pointless time wasting. It it only helps mental capacity just a little it better than not at all.
1,Andrea Bair,I think the positive reviews are fake! One said you can use the app for free and purchase what you need if you want to. Giving the impression that you don‚Äôt have to buy anything. FALSE! Only a 3 day free trial! I will never pay for an app. I searched and did not see anything saying purchase required. Makes me feel like this is a scam! Deleted the app!
5,Tnkgurl,"As a person With adhd thesis game is so much fun, the game is interactive and gives you a challenge in fun way. It is great for the brain because it challenges with new games each day."
2,Rebekah435,And ads and ads and try to sell you subscriptions or ad free sessions between more ads with skip buttons that open ads‚Ä¶ this is the only game I can‚Äôt figure out how to exit ads and play the game. After loops in ads to app store to ad to app store it starts another ad! enjoy!
5,MuRanDez619,"I love that games are short, and fun! It switches to different ones quite quickly! Great for super busy people that don‚Äôt have much time for games!"
5,aaplayer2219,honestly using impulse made me question my thinking and ideas but also made me challenge myself and use my brain more and increased my brain POWER!!!!
5,Mrs. Miranda,I LOVE IMPULSE But‚Ä¶ I have a few corrections .I think that there should be categories for younger children like 15-14 or 13-12 so then there are easy games. Also I would like if you could challenge a specific person not just the age group your in. BUT Don‚Äôt get me wrong impulse has to be one of my favorite apps so let me state what I love. ‚Ä¢very fun games ‚Ä¢sharpens your mind and senses  ‚Ä¢Let‚Äôs you pick what types of games like math or others  ‚Ä¢Game ideas ‚Ä¢AND MORE!
5,Chyniadokl,Has good content and keeps your mind going. Would recommend to anyone. App is easy to work they don‚Äôt pester you every hour to play. Absolutely love it!
5,üôàüíûü™êüë©‚Äçü¶º,Impulse has helped me in math and brain exercising. I‚Äôve only been using this app for two days and it has helped me so much. So many fun games to exercise your mind too!
5,Lailalove,I‚Äôm able to separate my work day from my personal life by playing these games after work
4,shetha1,"It‚Äôs a good way to stay sharp and on your toes, you will not be disappointed it‚Äôs an great game for those who struggle with concentration and memory and it also helps improve cognition. Go head and try it you‚Äôll love it! It does wonders for me"
5,QuelepaCity,Challenging and fun games. Adds always pop up but that wont keep me from playing
1,Dancing with heart,I clicked the trial button and then proceeded to download but didn‚Äôt realize they would charge the purchase price immediately. Beware they lie about having a trial. I‚Äôm unable to cancel because it shows up as a purchase and I cannot dispute the charge until it is no longer pending. App it ok but not interested in keeping it.

5,chuckiecheesewiz,I‚Äôm on Day 2 I hope to see results in the next coming weeks.  Games are fun but challenging!  Looking forward to continue training my brain.  Cheers ^_^
5,JackiePanfil,It‚Äôs so cool to see where you place on these tests and after every game it tells you where you place amongst others in your age group!! Really cool! Definitely worth it!
5,e411bo,It‚Äôs refreshing to my brain and I‚Äôm actually considering buying a subscription to see how much it will improve my memory. The devs put a lot of effort in the app and it‚Äôs noticeable.
5,trxgicshxt,Definitely recommend paying for if you‚Äôre trying to increase your skills
5,empowwow,I used to sit and waste so much time on apps like tictok and Facebook and afterwards I felt stupefied. Impulse has helped my memory and brain function so much!! I would recommend it to anyone!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,t3_the_kid,"Between this and Lumosity, these games will keep your brain sharp and they are actually fun and quick. It‚Äôs the modern day morning ‚Äúcrossword puzzle‚Äù. Get this game, stop reading what I‚Äôm typing lol."
5,Wookie4Eva,This game is challenging so it‚Äôs addictive & just when you think you can pick up the paste is when you slip up lol my eyes playing tricks on me‚Ä¶.
5,Dudeman110,"I enjoy this app from time to time, it has good simple brain games that allow me to stop thinking about complexed problems or thoughts and it‚Äôs entertaining."
4,directionally,I really enjoy using Impulse. My only feedback would be to allow me to use my profile across multiple devices.
4,BrentID,"This has been a fun game I, however, do not think that asking for a rating in the first 2 minutes of play is ridiculous I may write another review in a few weeks."
5,Master_Love,"Using the app as a part of my morning ritual. So far so good, usually do 10 minutes on the app after taking my green tea. I find this combination helps prime me for the day."
5,coolchick ;),"Feels easy but it‚Äôs a challenge for the brain to focus and be train every day, has helped me to improve my focus- a little train a day goes along the way."
5,Kicking It!!!,Haven‚Äôt even been using it but just a few days and love it. Thanks for putting your add out there for me to find. Needed something like this.

5,kenny wolo,"This is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever downloaded it is so fun and it helps me with staying focused, witch is just one of the many options that you can pick to improve!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,SuniMunni,"I first got the trial, and cancelled before the trial period was up, but I still got charged $7.49 on Nov 16. That was fine, I let that go. I got charged $7.49 again on Nov 23 despite no longer having a subscription. I thought fine again. I should have done something at this point, which is my mistake, because I got charged $7.49 again on Nov 25, not even a week later!   Beware, folks!"
5,Keys_and_Kicks,"I think that children should play this too, or at least they should have things like this in school to test their knowledge."
5,Tae √ôw√ö,"Honestly I have nothing bad to say about this app. I hate going to school and learning sometimes but this app helps me work on places I actually need help in, it‚Äôs awesome and I recommend P.S I‚Äôm 12"
5,cosmicpow,Honestly I‚Äôve noticed since doing the brain games and memory tasks my cognitive thinking has improved and I genuinely enjoy it too. It‚Äôs so fun
4,TuscaloosaShopper,Lots of games that will challenge your brain. There are a lot of ads and you are always asked to upgrade but can play some games for free. It can be a little annoying but the games are pretty fun.
4,ImDefUrMom,"I wish the Christmas special price would have been an option after I got to use the app a little bit because I definitely would have purchased it. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a poor person :)"
5,a.rose33,So far I am enjoying this app! The tests seem pretty accurate in describing my personality and ways to get better at some of my weaknesses! I‚Äôm always open to bettering myself!
5,Jjddsscrash,One of the few apps I‚Äôve found that cares what I think but delivers on what it promises.  Amazing in many ways and worth every penny.
5,ant.johnson,It has been helpful to take a few minutes to debrief from work and do one of the activities.
5,Baby Huck,So quick and fun. It‚Äôs easy to find time to do this several days a week!
5,aidenjamees,"I would call this a game, but it‚Äôs more of a challenge for your brain. It‚Äôs still fun, but it‚Äôs not much of a game. The only complaint I have are the ads."
5,shortyduopp,"I‚Äôm not the type of person who plays games on my phone but since I downloaded this, it keeps me interested and engaged."
5,MillFine,Two days in and I'm pumped up! Don't know why but in the short time I have experienced Impulse I've really enjoyed it.
5,Piggy doom,Love the layout and way the games are introduced. Easy to start with difficulty increasing as you progress. Well done creators.
5,Brwneyedgurl767,"They have one of my favorite games, candy/ball sorting and they have the colorblind option which is why I am able to play the game"
5,BarefootBeacon,It‚Äôs my 2nd day so not able to say how entire app is  To use all of the resources of app you need a subscription but the 3 free exercises quick and easy.
5,Letty Green,A great way to get the brain working faster and better and a lot of fun as well. Has sharpened my thinking and reactions since I started using this app
5,Joy58942,In two days in so can‚Äôt report much on how it‚Äôs helping but the games are fun. Layout is nice & there are a lot of options.
5,Acefh123,Program requires one to act quickly while having to think enjoyable and helpful
5,Austin7981,I utilize impulse for my brain to have that exercise routine it needs to be healthy and positively productive. So many different games and challenges to keep anyone engaged. It‚Äôs quite amazing!
5,SMCorley,I have purchased a lot of brain games over the years and this one is a lot of fun and worth the price
5,Thu best game!,This is a great game and at the start you can get up to a 92 percent off discount! For only 56 cents a week! This game is super awesome and not a lot of ads. I hope you try it out!
1,ImpulseSucks,"Do NOT recommend.   I saw an ad on IG for this app; in the ad they showed this graphic asking a bunch of questions to basically determine what you‚Äôre trauma response is. I thought it looked interesting so I went over to the App Store to download.   They offer you a free three day trial but once you complete your tests, they still don‚Äôt let you see your results unless you purchase a weekly or yearly plan. So what‚Äôs the free trial for then if you won‚Äôt show us our results?!?!   Again, DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Please steer clear of this app, it‚Äôs an absolute farce, the developers are shady and collecting and SELLING YOUR DATA. Very, VERY important data might I add."
5,Sandy Simpkins,I already am finding my mind gearing up and myself paying attention to details in everyday day life I wasn‚Äôt aware of before.
5,RUEXIDED,I‚Äôm doing this because I‚Äôm over 65 and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm forgetting a lot of things. It takes me more than a few seconds to remember.
5,llpuppies,I love this whole set up of testing and helping your memory and helping your capability. It helps you be more confident and it‚Äôs a lot of fun.
5,paigecurry,This is an awesome way to exercise your brain while killing a little bit of time or just to help you relax after a long day
5,mrksluv,i'm not one that typically likes the games apps available. This one is different...greater keeping your brain sharp.
4,CBS4Me,It‚Äôs fun challenging but I‚Äôm not sure why it says that you do better than a certain percentage of ppl cause it doesn‚Äôt seem that challenging that I would do 80% better than others
5,dhshhdhe,I can feel like my brain is getting sharper every time I play it. This is a great exercise then start off being on social media. Keep me busy I like it.
1,Jent85,"I tried to send the following message through your support website, it would not go through. Candy sort freezes on the last sword item and doesn't let you complete the game. I am on an iPad(8th generation) using the up-to-date iOS.(17.5.1). I have checked and my impulse app is up to date."
5,ATruGem22,This app is by far one of the best ones in the App Store. I‚Äôm on day 2 and I‚Äôm loving the games within that are challenging but also fun! You won‚Äôt go wrong with this app!
5,TruTrav227,Great game and way to use time in between appointments and work. Instead of scrolling of Facebook or instagram play these games to enhance you mental abilities
5,siejkenenehdidid,I like it so far! I play alot of games on my phone to destress and these are nice since they are supposed to help with my mental functioning!
5,kellyp4421,I use it everyday. My only complaint is that they don‚Äôt have anywhere near enough word searches.
5,EAW:),"The program is well written and has in depth, relevant challenges to improve areas of cognitive function I am interested in focusing on."
4,BrittanySwells,"Out of all the games this is the best because it is all in one place. However, I don‚Äôt like I had to pay for it but I got the whole year for a really good price due to a game"
5,Birdie Deaconess,Very cool to see what kind of information they can provide to you about yourself concerning brain health. The games are so much fun to play and there is a good variety.
5,Sweet easy,I‚Äôve been using this app for about three months and am really happy with the challenging process and the results.
5,fourhexagons,"I‚Äôm only one day in, so I can‚Äôt speak to the benefits, but it‚Äôs surely fun. I hope the brain improvement outweighs the negative effects of holding and staring at my phone for extended periods üòè"
5,YeetMan67,Only thing I‚Äôm finding a little annoying are the ads after every game. But overall great app!
5,VMP1018,"I love impulse because it helps your brain grow, and I can have lots of fun while learning it‚Äôs one of my favorite games to play"
5,Foxy552,Playing these games really does help me focus and learn better in general with everyday life. Basically it makes me smarter in all sorts of ways it seems.
5,Terrin*(:,I seen an ad on Instagram and decided to download it to give it a try. The fact that it‚Äôs a game but it does so much more just mentally makes me love it even more.
5,pyrochem15,I enjoy playing the trial version. I wish there were better price options.
5,Dimushkka,"Not only do I have a greater sense of mental sharpness; but also a better understanding of my mind/personality! The archetype tests shed a light as to what makes me, me. Great app and that I‚Äôll continue to use in the long term."
5,dotkaio,"The headline is pretty self-explanatory. Once the brain has constant contact with such exercise, neural plasticity take care of the rest. Highly recommended."
5,$leazeballl,This app is a lot like the feeling of being told to ‚Äúeat all your vegetables‚Äù bc after you start it‚Äôs so good and good FOR you! Win-win we all come out on top! Download A$VP!!
5,Colombianinja,"Simple and entertaining mini games to keep your mind sharp and focused.  Great to play while traveling , commuting or when you get the urge to challenge yourself mentally"
1,MightyManX,"The creators of Impulse are greedy people taking advantage of people who are struggling to make a quick buck. They allow you to take ‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù and ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù tests but then hide the results behind a paywall. The games meant to ‚Äútrain‚Äù your brain are also a complete joke, no need to charge $6.99 a week for things that are already free all over the internet."
5,dtk4us,So far I am really enjoying the games and information in the app. It doesn‚Äôt take long to do each day and keeps my brain sharp.
5,vbbbtyypppffqq,"Love the apps all the fun brain games all in one spot, but not willing to pay a monthly subscription or $40 for lifetime too expensive for apps games you can get free else where"
5,nadeebug,I love this app so much it helps keep all my bad thoughts in the background and is really fun with the mini games and I am glad to feel like I have people in real life and on the internet. JESUS LOVES YOU
4,Charlotte üòªü´∂,"This game is really good. I like it,  and I‚Äôve been playing it for the past 3 days. There‚Äôs only one thing. Some stuff costs money. (Yes, there are ads, but not that much) it‚Äôs very fun! It really gets me to think before school."
5,Top D0913,"So fun and easy to start, definitely can be challenging but in a good way. Push yourself further than what your brain thinks you can do !"
4,Mauigirl1307,"There are these tests on the app that tell you your IQ and a bunch of other stuff, but you have to pay to see the answers. Other than that I love this app!!!"
5,Nissa@May,This helps me stay focus and allows me to stress relief. It is intense at times but the exercises are fun and I feel good that I am not wasting my time on non effective games but games that improve my cognitive skills.
5,F__Sh,"Thanks to the organizers of this great program, I hope that all games can be used for free at least once a week. Thanks again."
5,Dtown Mom,"I like this game simply because it‚Äôs fun while it‚Äôs helping me keep my mind sharp.  Lately, I‚Äôve been having problems concentrating and I find this app helps me tremendously."

5,hsyeihsgeindvdoj,I live the idea of this app the games are fun and I love how they also include mental health tests it helps me get through the day and I also just live how positive the game is and it help me get in a positive mood and mind set
5,al renner,Fills in those gaps I would have been scrolling. Also I feel like I‚Äôm challenging my brain to be better.
5,margpen,Impulse actually is intriguing and I look forward to jumping on the app and testing my brain mid day. It keeps me busy while training my brain and I‚Äôm glad it exists
5,Lexirxo,I really am liking impulse so far. I haven‚Äôt been on it long but it‚Äôs a good way for me to do something for me that will be helpful in the long run.

4,Jevdet Y,I have not been using impulse for far now but I am already impressed on how much you can learn and how much this app offers. I really like the daily quizzes and the tests section of the app.
4,37 years a teacher,"I find my brain working to complete the games. As a 62 retired teacher, I read, exercise, and am learning a language. This app helps me use my brain in different ways."
5,Via's View,This game is great if you want to play something that gets your brain going and moving for the day. I play in the morning and it helps me to mentally prepare for the day ahead!
5,helpless102,I love challenges and being challenged so I am thinking that based on what has come up so far this will fit the bill. We will see.
1,Ehaaff24,"This game can‚Äôt let you play more than one level without an ad, I get needing to pay for the app while it‚Äôs free to download but there is such a large amount of them that it makes it completely not worth playing. Play a level that takes 10 seconds (at least at the start) and get hit with a 15 second ad."
3,_kristennp,"I wanted to take some tests and enjoyed the ones I did take but can‚Äôt see my results without paying. It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt offer something free, like watching a few ads to be able to view like most apps do."
5,DK71896,Impulse challenges you to think quickly and decisively with daily workouts and leisure activities to keep your brain healthy and alert.
5,vicktoplis,Don‚Äôt review much but I enjoy this product. I think next step to making this app even better is a more robust testing system.
5,Samaralsirena,It‚Äôs my first time using it and thankfully they have a free trial for me to experience. So far so great! The quality of tests already has me considering making the year purchase !
5,Zk890,I've really been enjoying the training and have noticed improvement in my processing speed.
5,Merkus1978,This is a great way to keep the brain moving. This should be something that would help people that are Alzheimer‚Äôs prone and prevent that from happening to them.
5,Douvs,"Variety of games that strengthen different characteristics. Would recommend this app to anyone looking for fun, easy to understand games that train your brain"
5,NHwicked13,Having so much fun on this game! I feel a lot sharper and I feel like my reaction times are a lot faster since I‚Äôve been playing!
5,Lohshrjjsbdbs,"I just got this game and I‚Äôm already seeing changes in attention and other things , it‚Äôs both fun and interesting, and a decent difficulty,   Very good"
4,Alta07,After completing the simplest math problems I read the results and saw that I outperformed 75% of people which makes me think that a) I‚Äôm either competing against toddlers or b) this world‚Äôs cognitive abilities are spiraling down with the speed of light
2,BeTrueToMe,There aren‚Äôt enough games to keep you occupied for more than about two weeks. Their updates don‚Äôt give you more games and their challenges are the same games over and over. It becomes seriously boring and useless very quickly.
5,Haru_yami.zz,I've only been playing for two days but so far I find it rather enjoyable! The different games and fun to play and I feel are effective.
5,country_rebel77,"The variety of activities works every section of brain, coordination, and speed one has"
5,tingstruck,"This app has great games that continue to challenge you as you move forward. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind buying the lifetime subscription."
5,Shannon-jane,Instead of scrolling for hours start of using this app to fix the addiction of scrolling for hours and actually strengthen your brain.
5,prcoooiooo,it‚Äôs good like u love it but it‚Äôs just so many ads but tbh it‚Äôs not at the fact that you can‚Äôt play or anything but it‚Äôs just if you want to play a game
5,awenli,"Very lovely app. Communication with the brain. If we can communicate with our brain, we get interesting results. I try to be friends with my brain"
5,Hsvsgshdheudbdhsvshsbsusvs,It is really fun and really good for me because I am a little slow so this is good for me and it is helping me learn more about things I maybe don‚Äôt know
5,Superdude (like super man),"I like the variety of games and the range of focus. The games are quick, interesting and allow me to choose what areas I want to focus on"
5,crobbinsdavis,"Great app to use while between meetings, or anything else you do throughout the day! Easy way to stay sharp! Don‚Äôt be a Nancy, and you‚Äôll always be on top!"
5,"i dont know, theyre all taken",So far my trial period is good. I wish they had individual accounts on one device in order to not have my kids mess up my scores
5,The real BomBailey,"It has me feeling smarter already. Plus,you can‚Äôt beat the fact that we‚Äôre having fun at the same time as strengthening our minds!"
5,EllieMoods,"Yes there are in app purchases , but if you play it for free it is amazing and works perfectly fine, you get enough games and yes there are ads but it‚Äôs worth it."
5,Cardoso.RLA,It a  very good game it helps me learn and calm me down I went to 0 to 100 you should try it
2,I‚Äôm not okay with in app ads,Love the games but at $28 I should never get in-app sales ads that prevent me from playing the games I PAID for. I unloaded the app and want my money back yet NO customer service. I‚Äôll take this to my credit card company. I do NOT recommend bc like I said $28 and you still get ads that interrupt your games. No thank you.
5,sidsid27,"I have enjoyed playing the games, their quick, and the ads are quick"
5,Angelabokeelia,I‚Äôve played it twice and I‚Äôm still interested. I may even pay for the membership.
4,a fair rater,The only reason it is 4 stars not 5 is because it is a great game don‚Äôt get me wrong but it is always pushing you to pay and start a subscription for it but over its a great game for your brain and has fun games
5,Pugzoli,This game has helped improve my focus so much and help me withdrawal from the multiple substances I was on it helped me find something to do when I was really fienin.
4,Geo Ant,It really great has really good things that help you and well I had just been using the app few days I can say is has it differences but there a lot in the app I haven‚Äôt experienced
5,*K*K,Nice meditative break in life to exercise the brain. I really like that I there are many games to choose from. Also and IQ test that you can take.
1,Jpinto171,"So this app says it‚Äôs free on the main page. However when you go to use it, it requires you to pay to use it. Technically, they aren‚Äôt lying when they say it‚Äôs free to download. They are being misleading. If the app charges money to use, than they should be upfront about it and not try and manipulate people into downloading it to boost their download numbers."
3,nellllio,Just getting started but the light gray and tiny print is so annoying! And can‚Äôt zoom so have to take a photo of every page.   And a grammatical error the second page in?? C‚Äômon guys. Hard to take you seriously.
5,Eduard raptunovich,Great app i use it often and have for months. One of the few i go back to regularly
5,BelieveIt88,Really nice when you have idol time or just need to take your brain for a walk lol from normal everyday routine and strengthen skills while doing something!

5,eetspeedilyootendooten,"As we age, we need to make sure our brains stay active. I love games, and these are designed to make your brain stay flexible."
5,Babe.Enue,I love to stay sharp and wanting to get rid of any type of unnecessary anxiety . Being out of school you practice certain techniques and skills . This is very helpful.
5,VManS17,Beyond what I was anticipating and we‚Äôll worth the purchase. I can feel my brain actively being engaged and having fun. Quite addictive in the best way possible!
4,Wallaceh,"I like the quick games of strategy, puzzles, and others. The only downside is all the ads but you can pay to have them removed."
5,callmeb9282,"Idk about buying it just yet . But i will say so far , it feels like working out but it‚Äôs your Brain  doing the work instead of your abs, etc. & That‚Äôs exciting."
5,cgarci063,Five stars because I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase and the game doesn‚Äôt have any bugs.I paid for a year at $30‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt pay $7 a week.
5,ziggilisous,the game play is great but the ads it a lot and i can‚Äôt pay for no ads bc i‚Äôm broke but it‚Äôs nice and i look forward to do my challenges daily

5,ü•∞üòòü•Ç,"The games are fun and there are plenty so it‚Äôs not monotonous! Writing a review is tough, however because it makes you put in a nickname but you cannot repeat one‚Äôs taken!"
1,dairyyyy queeeen,Advertised to me via a personality test. The app has much more. Tons of games tests etc. If you don‚Äôt pay for a subscription it‚Äôs all pointless. Might be worth it but might as well just make you pay up front rather than wait till after you invest in taking a 100 question test then make you pay for the results. SCUMMY!
5,WTP94611,"This app is easy to use, challenging and calibrated to meet your level of proficiency and help you improve brain function.  Great app to have on your phone!"
5,Chuckwins,Play games that actually make you smarter. Try the trial and they will offer you a discount to continue. I paid 30$ for a year.

5,Dorkluvr,"So far the games are fun, quick and entertaining. I actually enjoy taking the 5 minutes off and play the games as a little distraction ‚Ä¶"
5,Nateistaken,Look- I didn‚Äôt think this was work but my synapses are already sharper. I could do this all day. Give it a shot! It‚Äôs pretty good! Nothing but good things to say about this app!
5,JossueDev,I love this application. It has helped me calm my anxiety as I get entertained in games that allow me to grow my focus and memorization. I‚Äôve used it for two days so far and I love it.
5,thatjeffkidwiththebelt,I feel like the app is extremely helpful but can use some tweaking in the price I feel like the app asks to much for payment plans and should be free
5,Bridg4444,"I just started training my brain, but so far I am impressed with the platform and the games! Can‚Äôt wait to see my progress continue to grow!"

1,Hailey L.W.,"I tried to solve one the tests, IQ test specifically. Now I understand ads before and after the test or any quiz/test/exercise. But in the middle of the test there were sooo many ads that I had to wait and watch. Literally in the middle of the test after each couple questions the test was interrupted with sooo many ads. So unprofessional and demotivating."

1,Troye is b√¶,"There is a free trial, however you don‚Äôt really get to see the use of the app, you can take the assessments but then asks for payment, and only allows you to pay the yearly cost, while advertising it‚Äôs low weekly cost, which is be willing to pay weekly. I think it would be a good app, but I can‚Äôt really get a feel for it from the trial"
5,OGsilverback713,This game helps me with my adhd really much and it‚Äôs super relaxing. It also helps me keep my brain smart. You should download right now for your kids or yourself!

5,Purebeautifullight,I have had the app for 2 days and it‚Äôs been good. I bought the weekly plan and it has been working well for me.

5,Suzilouspring,I really like impulse because I can feel I am improving every day. I look forward to playing.
2,ooooogaboooooga,"After level 31 of the color sorting game, I got an ad after EVERY LEVEL. I get its free and all that, but it‚Äôs a bit extreme for a mini-game to contain such frequent ads. I didn‚Äôt feel rewarded for beating a level. I felt punished because I knew I was going to have to watch another ad for some random, cheap tycoon game."
5,Christ chex,"Love the app and what it has to offer, just wish they had a better deal rather than claim weren‚Äôt getting 92% off. üòÇ"

5,Rynosaurus,This game is everything and more I have dreams about impulse brain games it‚Äôs taking over my life and i love every minute of it
1,Bobbie Jo Stracener,Same issues as everyone else. The app giving 3 day free trial and not even  10 mins in already requiring me to pay to get results from a quiz that was free to take. Scam. Reading reviews looked liked the company replied which means maybe they are trying to improve it but then reading they generic and pretty much say same thing over and over
5,TopSecretWDW,Takes you out of your everyday thinking routine. Amazing how your brain works in different ways
3,Hurricane_Shane,"This developer keeps advertising this app by showing a specific game/puzzle in the ad. But when I download the app, that game is nowhere to be found! The app seems solid, but I am SO annoyed that I downloaded it SPECIFICALLY to play this one game and it‚Äôs NOT‚Ä¶. on there!!!  The game/puzzle is one where you are shown multiple pairs of colored dots and are asked to draw a line connecting each dot with the other one of the same color without crossing the lines.  It looks fun. But it‚Äôs NOT in the app.  I just wanna play the game!!! üò´"
5,kishiko5,Fun and invigorating to play! I can track and get to visually map my progress as I go :) And have fun playing brain games and improving brain health and power! Thanks Impulse!
5,SariCee,"Great app! Not only does it make me think, but also look, as well and move my fingers so all my coordinates are used!"
5,JJ204863,The app makes it easy to stay on edge. Ads are a bit excessive but keeps it free guess.
2,baaaarki,"The brain training games were really fun and well done. The gamification of the application has some nice touches that I enjoyed.   Here‚Äôs my problem. When I go to fill out an archetype questionnaire that‚Äôs 72 questions long and I can‚Äôt see my results before hitting a paywall, that is just a shame.   From a UX standpoint it makes me feel like you didn‚Äôt value my time enough to warn me that I would have to sign up before receiving results. At least inform the user to ensure that they understand how they‚Äôre about to spend their time.   I deleted the app."
5,WassupJoser,The app is very entertaining with all its games and puzzles. The variety is very impressive as well how smooth the game runs without a hiccup.
5,Charlsibree,"I‚Äôm happy to have found something similar to an app I used to play, everyday, several years ago! I can definitely tell the difference in my memory!"

5,jphotog,I think I‚Äôll know how I finally feel once I feel I see improvement and difficulty level increasing. Enjoyable so far.
5,TLBryan,I‚Äôm enjoying this app even tho I‚Äôm finding out how much help I need.  I‚Äôm looking forward to working thru these exercises to work this old brain!
3,Sem8480,For some reason the app is not registering the games I played today. I‚Äôve done each twice but it shows I‚Äôve done 0 and wants me to start a 3rd time. I hope this is a temporary glitch or the app will be useless.
5,SamIam257,I‚Äôm so glad I found this app. It is extremely helpful to your mind and becoming better with problem solving and memory.
5,CJG143,I‚Äôve played a handful of games in various apps and this is easily my favorite one. Lots of options for different challenges.

5,Adinn4,My teacher recommended this game for a test coming up and so I downloaded impulse and I added the test is helps so much I highly recommend impulse
5,TJDA82,Notifications do mess with it depending on your speed and attention span. Kids or something else going on can screw up accuracy scores. Overall a good game and calming.
5,DanielleT.,I needed something to challenge my thought processes. I came across impulse via Instagram and I can‚Äôt put the app down now.
5,BilliardzBiznatch,"I can feel my brain being stretched and strengthened with the games they have. Not to mention they are pretty fun. Give the free trial a shot, I upgraded as soon as I finished my first test."

5,Lightfoot 0311,I‚Äôve looked for brain games to keep my mind sharp and now I‚Äôm hooked. The IQ test is challenging and I think gave an accurate score. Glad I found this app.
1,Joytaciousrex,Decided to try the 3-day free trial to see if this is worth paying for. Took one tests and was led to a screen saying I need to upgrade to the yearly plan to access my results.   I don‚Äôt know how they expect someone to be able to determine the value of the paid version if the free trial doesn‚Äôt provide any insight into what information you‚Äôre paying for.
1,b√ºks,Found this app on a ad. Was immediately spammed with so many questions and pop -ups. Made me sign up before even using. Them I signed up tried to do a IQ test for like 15 mins & at the end it says you got to pay to see results. F this app. Got me hot. This might be the first review I ever left. Felt to compelled not to warn y‚Äôall

3,ProfessionalSaint,"Impulsive has helped me become a better thinker, quicker reaction time, and overall become a better person. However, what I failed to mention in that first part is that this game can be quite‚Ä¶repetitive in its action. Give it 3/3"
5,tru blu skidoo,This is the BEST memory app I have found. Easy to find the 10 minutes to check in a play a few games.

5,Toni in naperville,I love this app because it challenges my brain in so many areas that I don‚Äôt think of in my daily routine. It keeps me fresh and youthful.
5,badnews 67,There is always the uncommon factor to anything we do let‚Äôs try and mix it up more with common factors and maybe delaying response to time interaction

1,babbabsbsbbabsbbabsb,"It didn't even help me improve my memory it only taught me things I already know and overall is wasn't even fun. The advertisement was nothing like the game which also made me really upset. I wouldn't recommend this because it doesn't improve anything and it is so unworthy that you have to pay to play, for something that is useless."

1,B ripple,"I did not sign up but, was charged and it was very hard to cancel subscription. I could not find it in the usual place where subscriptions go.

After finally getting to the test I downloaded the app for in the first place, I was met with an ad for the apps premium subscription. This is after I had already selected the ‚Äúreject permanently‚Äù option before. Just let me watch and ad or something. I‚Äôm not paying to take some tests."
1,jo6003,SCAMMED ME! Very misleading information I was on the app. It popped up a game which said pick a present you get to keep what is behind the present. The one I picked said I get the weekly subscription for $.56 so I bought it. It said it was limited time for this screen only!!! I woke up with a charge for the full amount of the subscription!!!!! Unbelievably not fair and a big huge scam! GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
5,Donkey Lover 7762,"I like this app because it works your brain, and it is fun and challenging. I needed something else to do than watch TV, and this has helped."

1,farsuy,"On the advertisement they show some shapes that if you identify a set of them will tell you about childhood trauma. Inside the app there is no such test. All the tests and games are available for free on the internet elsewhere. They have the reports for these tests like archetype etc behind a paywall but I‚Äôve taken these tests for free on the internet, same test, without the paywall. This is a scam."
5,dombiez,Is what I say when I improve my scores mental ability and quickness is vital. This app helps you improve or enhance the you that‚Äôs already there.
4,bbjaye,This app could be much better without any ads. Some ads I can not even get out of because there is usually no x button whatsoever so please fix this
5,SunshineRainbows&Lollipops,It‚Äôs been a joy to use the app. I suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2019 and my doctor recommended I try brain exercises and I‚Äôm glad that apps like this exist today. Very cool.
5,TeamPvZ,I enjoy playing the games and also being challenged. I can see this being very helpful in reaching my personal goals.

3,EscapeGaner,"Candy sort has been freezing for months . First, it happened when placing the last ‚Äúball‚Äù into a tube. Now it is happening when it loads and when you complete a round."

5,Shunda Settles,"There‚Äôs literally so many different good games, puzzles all kinds. It also has different tests for different abilities. Totally worth it!!!"

5,Jssmith77,It‚Äôs good if you want to work on your brain skills for a bit especially if you‚Äôre bored or sitting in a waiting room
2,sdm_cgc_mdc,Recently I noticed that sometimes when I launch the game it just hangs on the logo screen.  The only time I got it to work was when I rebooted my phone.  Even then when it finally finished launching I got an ad even though I have a subscription.

5,mr. plumbean.,Very much enjoying this so far. I‚Äôve added it to my morning routine. Much better than mindlessly scrolling social media.
5,Mrs. Angel B,You might as well work on building neural connections instead of wasting them while scrolling on your phone.
5,Mulzey11111,"I love everything about this game and the daily trainings are a fun thing to keep me playing the game and the one line drawing, candy sort, and robotic flows are my favorite"

5,AppleVisionary,"As someone born with Neurological issues, I definitely feel as though this helps, and is therefore definitely worth the price üòÅ"

5,REWBQ,I haven‚Äôt committed to anything yet as I am in the 3-day grace period and am excited to see if this app supports my even evolving Artistic Awakening with own Spiritual‚Äôs friend.
1,Akmomma25,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre willing to pay pay pay! Played it for awhile but everything seemed to push towards having to pay for everything. Took a test but couldn‚Äôt see results without paying. Waste of time. Make it a one time fee for buying the app, these subscription based apps are annoying as heck."
5,Gee weezy,This game is actually worthy. It helps exercise the mind. I look forward to sitting down and really focusing on the daily game exercises they have for me.
4,dankie27,"A few too many ads for my liking, not willing to pay to remove them but overall a good stimulating game and keeps you sharp"

5,Mo3Diggity,I can really see the improvement in my remembrance of all the tests that I‚Äôve done that I haven‚Äôt seen in years. I can only imagine what‚Äôs next!! Keep up the good work!!!
5,AmyBCtheOD,Other brain games seem repetitive! This one has so many options and levels to each game!
3,mckeownjess,"Fun games and quizzes, but the free version is over the top annoying with ads. The games are very quick and after every two games is an ad, and they are longer than the games!"
5,Makuch2,I‚Äôve had it for one day and I can already see how beneficial this will be after daily use! The games are fun and the streak helps incentivize daily practice!
5,Doug_Dakil,Impulse has been very beneficial to me! I have used this app to help with my anxiety and stress and I couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled with how much it has helped out! Thanks to the devs for this one!
1,kiwiyamagushi,"I did the trial to test the archetype test, and after answering 72 questions they ask to pay for the app, if you decline, they ask to pay for the results üòÇ   I didn‚Äôt bother to even check out the other games and just deleted it. It‚Äôs a money grubbin‚Äô app, they should be upfront with what they will charge so you don‚Äôt waste your time. I hate these dark UX patterns."
5,Elloquito,"I have been using the application for a few days, usually in the morning and it wakes me up just like a cup of coffee!!!"
5,Wonderful new discovery,"I love this app and everything it has to offer. The graphics, the sounds and haptic patterns, the games and their complexity. Well worth the money by far"
5,@technicallybry,"So far I‚Äôm really enjoying this app, and I can say after a few days I‚Äôm enjoying clearer focus. I also taught myself a new mental math trick at 34 years old, which is really cool!"
5,Bri Brooks,It doesn‚Äôt even feel like you are working to learning. It‚Äôs feeling like you are playing the games but really you are learning.
5,Suddenlysixtysomething,I am surprised about my high scoring. It also alerted me to one task i am slow doing.
5,legalnurse,"So far, I have enjoyed it because they give you instructions and they are simple, precise and understandable. Enjoying it very much."

5,JKLMmom,"I play a lot of games on my phone, which may serve a similar purpose, but I like that they get harder and change"
5,Jennpacacha,Great brain game. Love the tests. One note though. Since I enjoy the tests so much and have a short attention span (what I‚Äôm working on) could you maybe add more tests with fewer questions. Thank you!
5,kc42690,The games are making you remember we used to know and helping you learn things you did not.

5,The one and only x 22,Has all the games I actually like as well as improving my cognitive functions!! Great way to take a break during the day.
4,GoopyGoop66,The games are fun and I enjoy challenging myself to do better each time. Only complaint is that it seems a little expensive for something as simple as a phone game.
5,Ironbullets2003,You‚Äôll forget all about you problem while trying to solving these fun and intense questions. Your brain will thank youüòÄ
5,MaitresseSaint,"I haven‚Äôt used it long enough to know if it‚Äôs actually helping with memory, but the games are enjoying. Almost meditative."

5,nova1234554321,"This game is amazing. They help you relax, test your brain skills, and get a sharp brain. For the time I have had this game I have enjoyed all of it and I suggest that you download this game.üòÅ"

5,Jonesmsr,I‚Äôm excited about a game that makes you utilize some critical thinking and works the ol‚Äô noodle out for a change!
4,"LL,COVT",The games on this app hit almost every area of VIP (visual information processing) as well as Executive Function demands. These games require your brain to use pathways that get ignored or suppressed in a person‚Äôs typical daily routine. Great for every brain!
5,hoopermusic,I‚Äôve had it a couple of days. Went ahead and paid for the discounted yearly rate. Fun little challenges.
5,Tyrannicus Rex,"Addictive, need I say more?! Plus it brings out your competitive side to see your performance against others"
5,Yeroc's girl,I like the variety of challenges offered as well as the opportunity to level up when you completes round error free.

5,DaviPBD,"I highly recommend this app to keep your critical thinking, processing, and memory skills sharp. It is very fun and the science of neuroplasticity and BDNF growth is proven to help. Highly recommend"
4,ANABSOLUTEFOOL,"Try more visually appealing techniques so it supports visual processing speed, which you‚Äôre supposed to work on obviously I know but the layout is a bit difficult to decipher sometimes"
5,Abigail.l.watson,"I enjoy this app because it occupies my brain, I‚Äôm a huge over-thinker so it helps me focus on one thing for longer than two seconds."
4,cvipe,I like the game Impulse because I am a competitive and I like to compete against myself to better my mental math.  The game is also well organized and easy to understand.  Material is presented in a non traditional way that encourages concentration and focus.
1,QUEENTQS,Says the IQ test are free but they aren‚Äôt You have to pay more money and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù but it charges you right then and then and then says that your previous amount that you were charged will be refunded in several business days. Really bad for business seriously just a money grab and should be definitely used for entertainment purposely only. It‚Äôs a waste
4,Chel1990,"I really enjoy playing this game, but there are a lot of ads. I get sick of waiting and end up clicking out of the game. Other than that, I really recommend and enjoy this app."
5,treewood817,This app is wonderful and so much fun I shared it with my team at work it is great for helping u problem solve and view things from different angles which is great for life
5,Ddhudfegigfqfhofefj,I love this app and I can use it anytime. I love how it test me and I love most of the games. It makes me feel smart and active. It helps me use my brain when I normally wouldn‚Äôt!
1,professor dep,"I purchased ‚Äúno-ads‚Äù for $4.99 while playing a game. Apparently the fine print says that it only removes ads for the specific brain game I was currently playing, not for the app. So the moment you switch brain games, ads are back. This is misleading and crazy expensive when compared to the cost of ad removal in other game apps."
5,2560164,I use impulse everyday and everyday I get better at the games. This app recommends games based on what you want to improve. I definitely recommend this app!
5,spatrob,"Good game to keep your mind sharp. Helps you focus and it‚Äôs not a time consuming game!  I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days, but so far I love it!"
5,Vik in NOLA,"I like doing the puzzles daily, and trying to beat my own high scores. Never gets old, and I feel like I‚Äôm actually challenged! Love this app ü•∞"
5,Square Direct Deposit,The puzzles and brain teasers are fun for any level and it‚Äôs easy to fit their 5min brain workout into my schedule instead of scrolling social media.
5,RoqueITFDB,You have to try this game it‚Äôs so much fun & the games it has you play keeps your brain going & I love the fact that my brain gets to work lots.
5,survivor 5673,"For someone who‚Äôs been suffered from short term memory since 2012 , I‚Äôve found something that‚Äôs not only helping me with my memory but also wit confidence & moralüôèüèª"

5,shrek83288,"amazing app. they have iq tests, games, and help to help train your brain. you have to pay more some parts, but you can exit out and still play games and do iq tests! love this app so much!"
5,Subes31,I really enjoy taking a few minutes to play this. It‚Äôs calming and I feel sharp rather than mindless as I do when playing other games.
5,5th LT,Impulse has given the chance to strengthen my brain muscles and wake them up. They have been dormant for quiet sometime and these exercises take me to the next level.
5,Rus+The+Nail,"I like this app because it causes me to think,and to actually use my own brain,and not a smart phone, so, I thank you for the breath of fresh use, lol"
5,Oshujala,In my 18 years of using mobile phones I have never liked the idea of gaming on them but this app will s much more than a game app. It‚Äôs a brain app
5,lettuce100,I‚Äôm being charged for this game and I don‚Äôt even play it! There is no way on the settings screen to delete payment information!! What type of app does that
1,KHOfficial,"This game is a swizz - a freaking con which preys on the vulnerability of those just looking for something fun to do once in a while. It is nothing like it is advertised, doesn‚Äôt tell you that it‚Äôs going to be priced until you have downloaded it. To be honest there are FAR better and more superior apps that help support mental health functions than this‚Ä¶ just saying."
1,Peachs 'n Cream,"Yeah so when setting up the app it requires a paid subscription and gave me no way to navigate past it to even see what the app or games were like.  Their response to people keeps being that you can get past that and then have a version with ads, but mine wouldn‚Äôt even let me do that.   It just wanted me to pay."
1,Jrad b,DO NOT! Download this app. I downloaded this in September and when I realized it costed money I immediately deleted it. Well without me knowing they automatically make an account for you and charge you for every couple weeks(even after cancelling and deleting the app).  I look back now and they have charged me over $105 for an app I haven‚Äôt had downloaded on my phone since September.  These guys are scumbags DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
5,vivi_rich,"when i got this i thought it was gonna be like others that were sketchy, but this is like legit fun and makes me feel good"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! üëçüíØ,I love this game so much it's so much fun and you can use it to pass the time one long car rides and airplane rides it's so much try it for your self and we I'd you don't believe me!  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1,jmryan28,"Took time out of my day to download this, sign up for the free trial, and take a personality quiz. You answer 40 questions and get to the end and there‚Äôs a paywall before it lets you see the results. Really?! What‚Äôs the point of a free trial? I want to see how legit your system is and whether I find it helpful before I agree to a yearly or weekly subscription. Stay away."
5,Abdul 1906,I have been using Impulse to unwind and self synchronize after long meetings. Great way to quickly boost brain use without doom scrolling.
5,823Levi0823,Fun if bored and it pops up. Not really that challenging unless you‚Äôre 10 yrs old maybe
5,Jesi127,I‚Äôve recently noticed I scroll too long on TikTok so I bought this app to replace my boredom and it‚Äôs been working really well ! Highly recommend !

3,Mickeysamgold,"A thousand new levels were added to the existing 1500 levels of Candy Sort, and several of them are repeats of previous levels. I don‚Äôt expect this for a paid service."

5,micchhaaeellapayne,Thanks for this distraction from mind numbing apps to get something out of paying on your phone so often!

5,starynight33,this game is so fun. even though i‚Äôm young. this game makes my brain improve. it also improves my ability to focus on things for longer periods of time. i have problems focusing on things in general but long periodically is ben worse. this game allows my focus to last way longer than it usually does. it also makes learning and increase brain health fun and easy.
5,TheOldMe4,"I‚Äôve actually surprised myself with my skills!! I LOVE the games, and the information provided on your particular test results. I‚Äôm looking forward to mastering it all!"
1,OCDVampire,You have to pay weekly.  Don‚Äôt waste your money on this. It‚Äôs very expensive.  When you load the app they ask you your goals etc and before you can play they offer you a short free trial.  If you accept the free trial it will automatically start charging you every week after the trial is over.
5,Teddys mammy,So much fun. Love the insight and the games. In order to get breakdowns of IQ and ADHD test etc you have to pay the month or year‚Ä¶ other than that the trial is awesome so far!!
5,EnaHBAtl83,"I really like the tests that teach you more about yourself, like your IQ, personality, and if you have adhd tendencies. Very cool app and the games are easy."
5,Katyy4056,"Fun yet challenging games. Spend a lot of time on the phone anyways. at least with this app, I feel a little less guilty."
5,Hxisnsjs6829,I‚Äôm two weeks into training and I do my training every morning- I feel like it‚Äôs a great way to get my mind awake and alert for my work day!
5,Kmyfvhfdssetyy,These exercises do help! There were a few that I had to really think awhile. Highly recommend
5,George Mansfield,Waking up in the morning and having the feeling I have done something good for my brain‚Ä¶ yeah gets the day started off right!
5,superchemdeedee,"This app is easy to use, the games are not boring, and I am working on improving the brain fog from long covid. Highly recommend!"
5,#TObHonest...,I like to play games from time to time on my phone; and it‚Äôs nice to play games that make me use my brain power and focus!!!
5,Dime 525,"This app is very beneficial to the cognitive brain development, a great way to start and end your day as it stimulates your brain. 10/10 recommend"
3,Testy and bored,"Some of the games have very specific regional understandings needed to be successful. Also, the tests do not up date and are extremely limited. The ones advertised have not been delivered months into usage."
5,Igna Group,It‚Äôs relaxing because you think of nothing more than what‚Äôs happening in front of you and it flexes your brain!
5,Summertime AJ,This game is the best. It has every brain games I could never think of. And when lesson is done I play nice games that help my brain. I so recommend this game it is awesome.
5,emilyrcraft,"I‚Äôve been using Impulse for over a year and their games are fun. I like to play games that help memory, increase focus, and include problem solving. Love it"
5,p.&.c forever,I like these games very much i actually do better than i thought i might
5,pinksma56,I enjoy the challenge and I felt good about the results. I think it‚Äôs a great way to improve your memory skills
1,ahannahahannah,"After maintaining a streak of 29 days, my account mysteriously deleted. I took so much pride in my streak because I‚Äôve been working on my consistency and mental growth. I was even looking forward to reaching a 30 days streak. However, that all came to an end. This crushed me and I will no longer use this app. I do not recommend this app."
5,KnitWitzStitchery,"The variety of games included in the app was very good, and they‚Äôre both entertaining and challenging.  Highly recommend!"
2,TjP√Ønk,"This app will not let you try it without a subscription. I did the three day trial subscription, and it would not show the results for tests without paying completely for a subscription. I was originally tempted to buy, but won‚Äôt considering the deceptive practice."
5,Njmerritt,"As an older person, I am happy to have a place where I can exercise my brain. Great puzzles and challenging as well."
5,Judy 3x,I can pick it up anytime and spend as much or as little time as I want. I hope to get better as time goes on.
1,Cyn123456,This game is totally useless clickbait. The games they advertise on social media aren‚Äôt even what you get when you download the app. Plus the games it does have are just constantly interrupted by ridiculously long advertisements for mind numbing games. I can‚Äôt believe this app has the ratings it does. Must be fake.
4,Punkrocklitty,There is no place to update your age. So being in a certain age group is permanent? I also purchased this for a lifetime I won‚Äôt be the same age for a lifetime. So far that the thing I see that I don‚Äôt like.
5,4swanys,"I never have played any games on my phone, but these are great.  And I love that they are helping my cognitive and executive functioning skills to improve."
3,3 stars it‚Äôs ok,Impulse is great for training your brain to do certain activities better but it does take a while and it‚Äôs not as fun as they make it sound you might like it but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like the greatest thing ever                      At least that‚Äôs what I think
5,Hippie_Gypsy_Witch,Take a break from life and enjoy the games that will improve your memory and other skills.
5,ESprog,"Not only do you get to learn more about your personality, test/strengthen your IQ, but you also get to unwind with fun games that keep your brain sharp."
5,Shesews,"I live in fear that I will get Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. My mother had it and it was awful! I want to do what I can to prevent it. These puzzles are fun and helping my memory to improve, you gotta love that! üòÅ"
5,NatL6,I have ADHD and it takes quite a bit to keep me entertained and focused. This seems to do the trick when I feel like I am hyper focused on unnecessary noise or tasks.
5,Shanman7,I love the games because they are really short. I can play 3 games in a few minutes and move on. Great app. Worth the premium for sure!!
5,Gnat2417,I originally got this app to play the games. Every test I‚Äôve taken so far is accurate and describes me quite well. I recommend.
5,Mens Agitat Molem,I like the intuitive interface and seeing my stats. I‚Äôm only on day 2 but enjoying it so far.
5,Robbieheybake,"I enjoy the app for what it is. I have the free version, and it gives me daily little tests to get my mind going in the morning. So far, I‚Äôve had fun with it!"
5,atrigaldo,"There are a variety of games that are interesting, fun and stimulating. If you like to challenge yourself and push the mental envelope this game is for you!"
5,DacodaRose,It seems pretty easy now that I‚Äôm just in the beginning but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to get tougher
5,Hinachan23,"I love the layout on this app and the games are pretty baller in setup. Added bonus, the daily workouts aren‚Äôt mentally exhausting üòå nice bite size pieces so you can keep going afterwards."
4,ashesofgrace,"Enjoyable fun and gets you thinking; I have enjoyed all the games I‚Äôve tried. Only drawback is ads if you use the free version, but that‚Äôs expected for games."
5,Kingsosa_3000,"Always looking for ways to grow my intellect, thankfully I came across Impulse and have started my journey toward true mental health."
5,Kaleesi10,"I try to walk 7 to 10,000 steps a day for my body and impulse is what I do on the daily for my brain. It‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs a great workout for the brain."
5,JulieKyna,"Easy and quick instructions. Games itself are fast, too. I like it a lot, so far."
5,Vane Hernandez,I enjoy Impulse because it keeps me busy and focused. Sometimes I go to sleep later because I don‚Äôt want to stop playing
5,tygamerforce,It takes practice don‚Äôt do everything at once just go in bite sized your skills will improve solid
1,WDPERK,"Don‚Äôt buy anything if you think the tests will tell you new stuff you can‚Äôt find online. If you want the brain games, seems to be plenty of that there for you‚Ä¶ but the advertising makes it seems like you‚Äôre gonna get an easy-to-read test result to help understand your ADHD type and personality, but the reality is lackluster."
5,debi jbk,This is a fun app and I‚Äôm learning as I train my mind to react to stimuli.  What‚Äôs better for this old lady than to get more intelligence and be Whitt and wise!  Enjoy the fun when you join in.
4,phlly_chs_stk,"I love the small games and I feel more confident in my mental abilities after using this app, and I just do 10 minutes a day in the morning before work"
5,SheMama09,Impulse is the BEST app that I‚Äôve purchased. Ever! From the personalized training sessions to the different game you can play to strengthen your brain in between training sessions. LOVE IT!!
5,PY--- miss Open Table,"Impulse is fantastic. I have become quicker, deeper thinking, and more comprehensive than when I started. Impulse is far more than I had hoped. Got to keep going!"
5,Thereareliterallynonames,"This app has so many fun options. It‚Äôs like every brain app I was looking for is in one app! It is fun and educational, and a perfect app for everyone"
5,tabbydrew72,When I sit down to do my daily work my kids even get excited and watch me and we all get a brain exercise in. Absolutely love it!
5,Kate9618!,"Loving Impulse completely!!! Only had it for a few days, however can‚Äôt wait for what comes next with this app!!!"
5,Very great and calming app,This might be one of the most calming apps I have ever used. It‚Äôs calming and is has helped with helping muscle memory
5,Kip Roughrider,"Love it so far, great way to wake up my mind in the morning,  even before coffee. Time will tell if it really works, but even if it doesn‚Äôt it is a lot of fun"
5,Super fun@$@)(,"I am 36 and love playing phone games. That being said, I wanted something that would also challenge me. This app fits the bill!"
5,MFlo928,I‚Äôm 40 and this is a great way to keep my brain sharp. I enjoy all of the exercises. Everyone should do this a few minutes everyday.
5,SKCOLUMBUS,Helps me clear my mind from the day‚Äôs stress and makes me feel more on top of things in terms of my brain functioning/thinking clearly!
5,Journey Dawn,It‚Äôs a great learning experience for me . It‚Äôs helps my ADHD alot . I‚Äôm able to focus more on what I‚Äôm doing rather than focusing anything else or everything lol.
4,Max_36048,I like Impulse but it has its flaws. Every time I get out of a game an ad pops up for me to buy something and it comes up right on top of the play button so I almost spent $30 bc I wanted to play a game.
3,JYDEtroit,Great games. Super graphics. But it needs updating. Did you just write this then never again put effort into it? Please add more candy sorting. Once I maxed out I couldn‚Äôt reset it. Once you‚Äôve done it for a few weeks it gets boring.
3,cool coaca,"It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôll make this short but not too many ads, interesting things to do. Big downside: YOU HAVE TO BUY SO MANY THINGS TO GET FULL ACCESS. To find the results of a quiz, you have to buy. And every time you open the app IT ADVERTISES BUYING UNLIMITED ACCESS. Not something for people who don‚Äôt want to pay money."
5,#1PradaDog,"I love the games and how it increases in difficulty. Although I am unable to purchase the game, I definitely feel it would be beneficial."
5,mikoGamer:),"Not only is this app the best brain training app ever, but I got a coupon so I have to now pay $30 yearly!!üòä there are brain games too! Thank you so much Impulse!!‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,im a giraffe rawr,I tried this app out thinking it would be fun and it is for the most part until you get to the results for any test you have to pay to see your results which is ridiculous I mean what‚Äôs the point of taking the quiz if you can‚Äôt see your results I mean really it‚Äôs disappointing
5,Zugeex,Impulse gives a brief explanation for the skills practiced prior to each activity and  at-a-glance review of performance after. The activities are stimulating and progress in difficulty at a reasonable rate.
5,‚ú®GwOrL‚ú®,"It‚Äôs literally every brain sharpening game ever existed! Also on my first day you could choose from 3 boxes and I got a 92% discount for premium! And it‚Äôs fun, relaxing, and perfect for younger kids"
5,Mem#85,Great streamlined games that challenge the brain. App is also so easy to use and I like the pop up reminders
5,werrtgvxxaswawNOW jfcffjcgjcg,"At first, I did not know how to read, but it taught me how to read and how to do my multiplication better and my division and everything else I need help in"
5,LilBigPine,"So far so good wish I didn‚Äôt buy the lifetime package that‚Äôs what happens when your drinking I guess, challenging and fun makes me think I‚Äôm getting smarter"
4,Mangomuncher1,I think the impulse is a really good app. You can play a bunch of games and it‚Äôs really fun. The only downside I think it has is that it has a lot of ads but other than the ads I think it‚Äôs really cool
5,Woowendy,Still trying to figure out what all my results actually mean but entertaining and challenging.
5,Danimal1978,"Fun quick games to help relax and unwind. I‚Äôd almost say it‚Äôs mindless fun, but you do have to think. it focuses you on small quick tasks that also help w/ memory skills"
5,Bob2229,You are wonderful. The only way you could be better is if you did not charge!?!
5,cc2388,"I‚Äôd love more levels of candy sort and a response to my inquiry to developer about an issue with one of the levels. But still, best game app out there!"
4,Fire Avocado,I downloaded this for the adhd type test but all I saw is the general do you have adhd test. The games are nice and it could be fun and useful but I really wanted to take that test
5,bobboboboobobobobovf,This app makes me feel less guilty for enjoying some screen time in stolen moments during my busy day. I am doing something positive for my brain and it is relaxing and fun. PERFECT!
5,sandman5209,"I love the game there‚Äôs so much to do like tests, games, quizzes and etc the free game of the day is one of my favorite parts of the game and if you are trying to challenge your brain this is the perfect game"
5,Monerolord,The apps is user friendly and very interactive. Daily exercises help you keep your brain sharp while you wait in line or lie in bed. Great app overall!
5,Sheweeeee,"Frustrating but that can be the nature of a good challenge. Haven‚Äôt invested in it as of yet, but so far (it‚Äôs only my second day) I am enjoying the app"
5,Rue ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"My days can be pretty boring, but doing these little brain games makes me feel like I‚Äôm actually doing something üòÇ"
5,Masseymomma3,I‚Äôve done two days worth but it is pretty cool so far. It keeps wanting me to subscribe to a yearly subscription. So far I can close out of it.
5,a person i guess?,It helped me focus a lot and if you need help like remembering or focusing or anything else Impulse is the right app for you and to train your brain! Thank you for reading and shoutout to Impulse!
5,EagleOnRye,"Feels more productive than any old phone game, keeps me busy, makes me feel like my mind isn‚Äôt mush. Pattern seeking activities, matching, math and more"
1,Jekehdgejdnhzuf,Don‚Äôt buy this cause I tried buying it and the first thing they did was try and get money outta me frl and it was all good until all I wanted to do was relieve my stress and do this quiz and now I can‚Äôt even see my results because I got to pay for a subscription or buy the results like what? They over here just tryna get money outta people frl so don‚Äôt buy this.
5,jdogjr,I love this app so much because it is making use my Brain in ways I never did before and it keeps me focused on the task at hand
5,For my new figure123456789,"I really like this so far, it‚Äôs challenging to an extent however fun. It serves as a nice break in the day to not focus on the day and rather what‚Äôs right in front of you. 5/5"
4,NYC Kasia,"It‚Äôs a good app to exercise your brain for a few minutes a day. It helps you set goals, choose what you want to work on and how much time you want to spend playing games each day."
5,BanduGuy,I love impulse! It‚Äôs the best anxiety reliever app! I love it because it helps your brain develop new skills and it unlocks SO MANY skills you didn‚Äôt know you could have! Just get the app! It‚Äôs amazing.

5,LEGOPRINCESS135,"Hi, I love impulse it is an amazing game for people like me, I have a medical thing where I‚Äôm further down in grades and it‚Äôs harder to remember lots of things. Impulse is helping me change that and it really fun too!"
5,LexMex06!,"Made me realize at least. When I‚Äôm wasting time in an app, I‚Äôm training my mind to be more sharp and less stressful when thinking of an answer."
5,Kolene223,Starts out slower and builds. I feel that this app has helped my concentration improve and I‚Äôm able to recall information more easily!
5,JenZenQ,Something to keep your brain working if you have a few minutes to burn on a train or in line.
5,Janagg2010,"It‚Äôs really fun, it test my brain and they are also other puzzles to do after you do your daily workout. Is so fun I can‚Äôt stop playing it!"
5,ashlizrow,I‚Äôm really enjoying this game so far! I‚Äôve only had it for a few days but it is entertaining and helping to keep my mind keen! Highly recommend!
5,Deananarama,"I have been battling long Covid. I don‚Äôt know if it is helping in a clinical sense, but I feel like it is. Impulse seems to be helping me concentrate in little snippets of time."
5,Scrubs1989,I hope the deets on here is accurate because I wasn‚Äôt never sure of myself. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Justatouchaway,This app was recommended by my therapist. It helps with my PCS and memory problem. I wlove it and I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends!

5,Bolowei,"I have only had it for a few days, but the app handles your dally tasks while there is still a lot you can do if you want. Pretty cool."
5,Kay Baldwin,"It really exercises your mind but is a relaxing and calming game, it is excellent for training the eye and being quick to have the brain really moving to reach the next set goal."
5,Meechem22,I have been looking for a game to test me and no other game has so many things to test you on all fields of academics and puzzles and memory
5,Tacolover664,Started playing brain games to keep my mind sharp. The games in this app are fun and challenging and I can definitely see how playing them will help me long term.
5,joker_alexander,When I have a very unproductive day I use this and it makes my brain up and going again!!!!! Highly recommend this game.
5,Crystald18,I enjoy the games on Impulse. I can see how beneficial the skills are in the games. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to strengthen personal skills in a fun way!
5,GrifdaKing,But it is very rewarding I feel like this could help a lot of people that have issues focusing on tasks. Overall excellence describes this app

5,P36543,If you like to challenge yourself and have fun at the same time this is the app you‚Äôre looking for!
4,biggreendad,"Initially, you wouldn‚Äôt think that you would not only enjoy the types of exercises but also the effort you make trying to achieve the next game."
1,talktotisha,"I get that the goal is to make money - but the ridiculously loud apps after every single level just made me hate the game - I grew increasingly annoyed after each ad that I deleted the app, versus purchasing.  There‚Äôs a way to entice players to buy your app - dumping 20 seconds ads after every 30 seconds of play is not it. at. all."
1,12345678abracadabra,"I just got it and was able to play one game after watching 2-3 commercials. It froze after that snd it was no way to open it. I am taking it off my phone but I was wondering if there is a payment after the two days, although I did not go far enough to agree to it. Please let me know how I can check for subscription or not. Thanks"
1,MODERNxESK1M0,"I downloaded this app hoping to train my brain and while looking at the subscriptions I accidentally clicked on one, somehow when I pressed cancel it purchased it so now I have a premium subscription I don‚Äôt even want, I go to the website i see them saying where to cancel it but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. All I want is to cancel my subscription I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on this at all!!!"
1,MacTeve,"I seriously can‚Äôt believe you would charge $6.99 a week for something like this. You are ripping off your customers. On top of that, you all have a very entitled attitude when responding to customers reviews to your app. No wonder you are charging so much up front, rip off your customers for as much as you can now because you know you won‚Äôt last as a business."
3,Momammaom,"Advertised everywhere that what you see in a picture can indicate trauma type. However, I see the trauma quiz with questions, but the picture test is now where. False advertisement? And yes, I have a paid subscription."
5,tlchc,I don‚Äôt like to play games much but it‚Äôs nice to stimulate your brain once in a while. This app gives you the opportunity to do that.

5,$ƒßoot√´r4l√Øfe,This is the best app I‚Äôve ever came across the moment I started playing it. I feel a big difference in the way I use my brain.

5,TheeGrace‚ÄºÔ∏è,"I wish they would offer the same discount they offered me for the yearly membership, for the life time membership! It really works the brain!"

5,Luvsglam,This makes you think outside the box
5,Gus1111111,Very interesting and challenging  Kept my interest for a long time Looking forward to playing again tomorrow
5,MamaNoobs,"I‚Äôm surprised that an app about memory could actually be fun! But of course, it is! There‚Äôs variety so you‚Äôll want to go back for more!"
5,Plundermenace,They are engaging enough that you don‚Äôt realize that you are training your brain!
2,Share Vann,I play Candy Sort. Since the latest update the game freezes at the end and won‚Äôt refresh. You have to leave the game completely and come back in. But then it does that same thing over and over again.
5,ooferdude23,I have anxiety and a lot of panic game is helpful to just calm you down and make you realize you are thinking properly and are not in a state of panic
5,Lisser Lor,"I love the feedback after each game, and love the games in general. Variety, feels useful, makes me feel good instead of guilty. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
3,flbyo,"It truly was great fun and good for the mind.  One of my very favorite apps.  Lately, the software is totally lacking!  It‚Äôs not working at all.  I give the right solutions, but the software freezes and does not allow me to proceed, rendering the app useless.  I‚Äôm sad.  Please fix!!"
5,Risen0,3 day free trial has gone really well so far. On day 2. I really like the anxiety/stress tests. The games are also fun and it‚Äôs nice to know that playing them is strengthening my mind.
5,Luv2pray,"This app is fantastic. It has allowed me to test my skills, and I've excelled in most of the challenging games. I highly recommend this app to everyone I talk to."
3,MuathS95,I like how we played before the latest update. Now things are much slower because it remembers where i left off? Who cares?! Also in the candy game now the balls move by themselves. Not call it‚Äôs too noisy
4,WhoJ3x,"The app is a fun way to pass time. The questions that are offered are fun and sometimes challenging, but never anything to discourage. I‚Äôd recommend it to people trying to stay sharp."
5,OpnMyMind,Although I‚Äôve just started the brain training exercises are interesting and intriguing. I am not disappointed at all.
5,Jigaboos454u,"This is simply not complicated, take care of yourself. Eventually you will feel better about doing so. I love you."
5,Alexis E..,I really enjoy using this app; the tests really helped me understand my personality type and responses to certain situations. I definitely recommend this app.
4,armandsangel,"I am really liking the games. They are fun and challenging. I just wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay to get the full experience. Still, I‚Äôm enjoying the free experience also."
5,TheCrystalWitch1231,This is a great app for anyone who wants work on basically any brain function. The games are fun and quick and I like how it‚Äôs tailored to you.
5,JJAHut0512,I love Impulse bc I‚Äôm learning things about myself that are necessary in order for me to start living a better life. I owe a lot to this app! Thank u to the Creator(s) for making Impulse!
5,cd5052,"So far I like this, haven‚Äôt decided to purchase but may do so after a few more sessions"
5,paisa2018,I can‚Äôt think of something to help may be share how smart you are with friends and invite friend like on call of duty
5,austend,The first thing you should do is to check your email and log in.
5,Sam013196,Helps me ease my anxiety and instead of scrolling on other social media platforms I can go to Impulse and actually make my brain happy!!!
4,breezer by the bay,Still being introduced to Impulse. This maybe the app I‚Äôve been looking for.   Working the brain muscle and getting feedback on my efforts.  I like it.  As an older adult with ADHD I could get ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on the mental workout.
5,Vanni0894,It has great memories games. Simply but if you want to distract yourself for a couple os minutes I think you will like it.
5,jacquz,I recommend this to anybody who is having trouble with their memory. This helps to focus and think.
4,jteaches,I just got started and I am already noticing a positive difference in my mental abilities. I only rated it 4 stars because I believe there is always room to grow. It would be nice if there was a musical option.
1,StealthGear,"I started a free trial and within the first 10min of use, I decided to purchase a longer subscription but it charged me for the 7-day trial anyway. The charge I accepted was only for the other subscription and was surprised to see a higher amount on my bank account. I never approved the 7-day charge. Would be nice to get my money back."
5,myboykavanaugh,"After cranial brain surgery, I found this app to stay on top of my cognitive development & functions and it has been helpful for my mental health and mental wellbeing."
5,Jeg780,Several different games. They do not take long
5,Jojo567hake,So far so good. There‚Äôs deff pop up for subscriptions but easy to bypass and utilize with plenty of free challenges and games. Easy to use easy interface great app.
1,Pobbusu,Can‚Äôt read the full archetype report after answering all 72 questions without paying even if you‚Äôre using the free trial. They don‚Äôt tell you this until you answer the whole thing too. The Dev response makes no sense because if you won‚Äôt show the results you shouldn‚Äôt allow a free trial user to tow the test in the first place
5,Amanda Wait,I look forward to seeing how I rank to others and it‚Äôs interesting to see the ones I do well with!
1,Natal_000,The free trial has limitations that can only be removed if you pay the yearly fee! This app also claims to give you a free 3 day trial. The app doesn‚Äôt honor their own cancellation policy and will charge you despite cancelling within the recommended timeframe. This app is not worth the headache of having to dispute the charge with your bank. Pick another reliable app that honors their own policies.
5,Alexis Amendola,I like it a lot. Passes time without knowing it. Takes my mind off of everything and is fun too. I like this a lot.
5,probablykate,"I enjoy all the puzzles and quizzes available. It makes learning about your brain, and solving puzzles seem like a game."
3,Bumblebees45,"I love brain games, but too many ads! No one wants to watch a 30s ad after every single 20 second game‚Ä¶. This is a problem across the board these days and I‚Äôve deleted a lot of games after 1 play."
5,Aimee from DE,"Impulse is a very fun way to spent your time online. Instead of mindless scrolling, I feel like I‚Äôm doing something positive for my brain!"
5,Jayden is cool to /:,"I was told by the app to give this a 5 star review, but tbh it‚Äôs not bad. I feel like it‚Äôs 10 brain puzzling games all in one game. 5 stars is a little much, but I‚Äôd say 4.4/5"
5,DRG1,I‚Äôve just started and love the quick brain challenges that I‚Äôm asked to complete. I hope to keep my brain sharp!!
5,Wendy0000000000,"10/10 would recommend, If you don‚Äôt have this app on your phone you‚Äôre not in the cool kids club."
5,fineasscardplayer,"I‚Äôve only just started but it‚Äôs keeping me interested. The dopamine hits I‚Äôm getting from playing, makes this app super satisfying and effective!"
5,Riosstoria2013,"Impulse is the best game ever! It is fun and entertaining. I only had it for a week and boy, it is amazing!! I don‚Äôt even need to download any other  games because it is so cool plus it is cheap."
4,Mope0,Really enjoy this app but I wish I could back to easier difficulties to practice on certain games other than that this app is awesome
5,youtube3suck,I have bought the app two days and I like it. The games are well designed and could make me focus‚Äôs.
5,mrvintage1945,"These games do get a lot harder at the higher levels but I guess that‚Äôs good, right? DEFINITELY gives your brain a good workout at the mental gym. Really enjoy them."
5,KJCC111,"It is easy to dive into the brain exercises, even if you only have 5-10 mins to ‚Äúplay‚Äù."
2,NatAlt Foco,I‚Äôll admit I have little patience when it comes to ads but I tried the free version to make sure this was going to be worth the purchase‚Ä¶There are so many ads that I closed out. I got three pop ups before I could even make a selection to start and then ANOTHER ad.
5,slimqt1,The games have been fun and chalk and jus what you see on the ad! I play the free version so the ad are long but m considering purchasing.
5,rcor0562,"I enjoy the games and my memory is improving everyday, I‚Äôve been using the app for a week and it works"
5,KimJones1973,I‚Äôm doing the free trial right now but so far it‚Äôs great. Exercising your brain in the form of quick little games that make you think.  Great app!
1,H suze,I signed up for a free trial - the app clearly stated no payment today - and was immediately charged $43. I requested a refund through apple but it left a bad taste in my mouth so I won‚Äôt be using the app after all.  Edit: developer response didn‚Äôt seem to actually read my review. The app offered a free trial and it wasn‚Äôt given. I already know how to cancel a subscription.
5,voidjacked,I find this to be an entertaining way to sharpen the mind and see where you‚Äôre at with your own brain
5,Powhoodoshow,I loving playing impulse to improve my memory and problem solving skills! It‚Äôs also helped me get my mind off of things on stressful days!
1,bethua,I‚Äôve enjoyed every part of this app up until I went through all the levels for several of the different games. I‚Äôm replaying the same stuff and am super disappointed because I‚Äôve been waiting for a long time. Y‚Äôall said it would be updated last year and nothing has happened.
5,RAAW SOUNDZ,I work this app everyday just to build and keep my brain strong. It‚Äôs like my daily brain workout without weights!
5,yea2710,"I do these brain games for about 10 mins each morning, its the best way to wake up and their fun!"
5,Raymondgirl97,I have tried other brain games and this one by far is the best! I like the games and the app is easy to use!
2,Soulbre,"I would love this app so much if it had any sort of free-ness to it. I only get to use it for four days and then nothing is free and I think that‚Äôs silly. If the app isn‚Äôt actually free then you should think about putting a price on it in the App Store, so broke people like me don‚Äôt get their hopes up."
4,kira diaz,"This app is okay and it does actually work, I‚Äôm having fun playing the games and I‚Äôm learning at the same time"
5,Epicriss,"Slow and not too challenging at first, but I can see that, with time, the challenge will be there."
1,Te Menon,"This app makes it impossible for you to cancel if you sign up for the free trial. I have sent them multiple emails, comments and messages on social media to ask them to cancel and they still have not.  The games are so-so, so if you are on the fence do not subscribe to the free trial as you might have to pay for something that you can get elsewhere for fee"
5,061889Emj,Cool concept. Fun interesting tasks to complete. Though it‚Äôs a cool app I think improvement on the score like what is your actual score and what the comparison means
5,JuNeneK,You don‚Äôt realize just how solving simple problems can keep your brain sharp. I use it often.
5,Twinklestarisbright,"This is so easy to use and at anytime you want to use it. Helps improve cognitive thinking, quickness and accuracy. Get it.  You won‚Äôt regret it."
5,Grapejuicerickey,There are an excessive amount of ads if you don‚Äôt pay but if you can ignore that it‚Äôs a lot of fun and keeps your mind working
5,Bswazy02,If you like games that pick your brain this is the perfect app it has a little of everything testing all your abilities.
5,snowdawg12,I love this daily routine when I am resorting to my old habits I can instead open this app and play these small games to distract myself mentally.
5,lolhiidkwhatsup,turns your mind off and makes your brain workout at the same time. Best of both worlds
5,inushi,This is the best game ever I say this because I have tried many of them and this one has worked so well I feel so calm. Hope this helps :)
5,AudriAnna1111,Love this game it makes working out your memory a lot of fun plus I like all the test they have available for people to take
3,Monkey_D._Luffy,"It‚Äôs good to exercise your brain but this game is kinda limited. If you want more features, you have to pay. Don‚Äôt waste your money. There are more free games with unlimited features. Save your money and manage your budget wisely"
5,downlod it now!,Great experience with the apps bf the interface. Highly recommend but definitely be ready to pay
1,yngboyjake,"Absolutely useless, all it does is give you vague pseudoscience and spam you with notifications to get you to hop on it and watch more ads. Definitely a pointless app but people who feel they don‚Äôt know themselves enough and need others to do their thinking and labeling for them will fall for it. Would not recommend"
1,terrible-app-good-job,"When signing up for a free trial you are told the trial is for a period of 3 days. In their subscription policy, they state ‚Äú Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period.‚Äù Thereby your ‚Äú3 day trial‚Äù is really a two day trial. Don‚Äôt let these guys screw you over!"
5,hdld skabdjsnvd,Its helped with my stress and strengthened my memory. I would definitely recommend it to everyone even if they don‚Äôt experience stress and anxiety.
4,mC2016Eddie,This game is nice to use while unwinding from the day. It helps with Lessing my over thinking from the day‚Äôs adventure. Second day of using the app looking forward to what may happen.
5,BugPartyTime,I got it because I got the huge sale and I‚Äôm not disappointed. I love the peer comparisons it makes me want to keep going!
5,GI@ssy,This is my favorite brain game that I have though I don‚Äôt think we should have ads ever time we are doing our daily game/s.
5,Hei Hei 1234,It gives you great ways to wake up your brain and helps to improve your reflexes
5,Boston_52,"I‚Äôve only used for a few days, but I enjoy so far. I like the pace of the app, doesn‚Äôt drag or not load quickly"
5,Sis. Beverly,"Impluse makes me think harder and quicker. It lets me see and remember the next move. I like impulse because of the randomness of games, and they are not boring"
5,Proud Tsa La Gi Mom,"I‚Äôve enjoyed leveling up on this app, I feel like the short daily tests are giving me a boost. Plan to keep up with daily checks."
5,K√©√©ra,I really enjoy doing these activities bc it gets my mind going and it‚Äôs calming too. I might rethink the ongoing subscription bc it could be very helpful in my day to day!
5,Disappointed404,I‚Äôve only had it for a couple of days and I‚Äôm still trying to decide if I want to upgrade. So far it seems pretty legit!
5,CaseyLeeLane,This course works with you and is a very reasonable way to get your brain back on a learning tract. The program builds confidence well.
5,Gaycon,"As we get older this type of app helps with keeping our minds sharp. Love it. There are so many different game exercises, you can not get bored."
5,rpm1956,I Really enjoy the games and I surprised myself by how much Work I need in my reaction and memory I look forward to working on my mind
4,TMILLLOVESMUCH,Enjoying this app so far - I was never one for multiplication or division as a kid and recall spending lots of time in the hallway crying during Algebra.   So an app like this helps me brush up on some skills I never quite mastered as a kid. üòÄ
5,Eittens,The games are challenging but simple to understand. I got this app a few days ago and I‚Äôm obsessed. Definitely recommend this app!
5,tobybrint,This game definitely keeps your mind sharp and health. I would like to thank the team of developers for dropping such great product!
5,Luna Daigorth,"You can pick how many minutes you‚Äôd like to train a day, and I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed with the time I chose. The games are fun and engaging."
5,GroovyKndoflove,Thank you sometimes you just need a little push in the right direction to remember what you are capable of.
5,notmyricksha,Impulse is addictive in a good way. It helps you retain memory in the most fun way. I found myself kept on going back to it on my subway rides.
5,don don sinabon,This game has helped me so much I also have really good memory now I want to thank the creator so much I give many many many thanks
4,LyddBabby,Really engaging and exciting challenges that are hard enough to actually challenge you but fun enough to make you want to do better and keep playing!
1,Anon150964890,"There is literally an ad right after every game, sometimes every other game. I know they do this to make money, but I feel as if it‚Äôs being shoved down my throat to make me pay for the ad free version. I can understand the occasional ad, but it‚Äôs just too much and I‚Äôd rather delete the app than pay to have no ads."
5,Larry Knox,This app has been able to shed light on the areas of my brain that are strong and the areas that I can improve. Thank you!
5,AllanE92,The games are fun and it makes me very competitive. Fun and not just a waste of time like Candy crush or something like that.
5,AriesTaur,It is a subscription and so I decided with the black Friday pricing to try it. There are many games daily to help with memory.
5,KitJohn17,My kids love the games as much as I do. It‚Äôs fun to let them play it and share excitement over brain games instead of mindless crap games.
5,papagino,I downloaded this a while back and only recently started. I‚Äôm having fun and plan to continue the free version!
5,Mahkays,I love this so much I finding out things that I never new beget and it‚Äôs helping me a lot with school and getting good grades and it helps me on math which I am not good at lol highly recommended.
5,5star_re-v.u,"I get obsessed playing Impulse, I'll much rather spend my time in this app than üëÄtik tok which doesn't do any good to my üß†."
5,aselac,Challenges my brain for quick accurate thinking
4,Sucky dashboard...111,"The messages for the large # of updates drives me nuts. I haven‚Äôt noticed any improvements or added levels in any updates. Also, pricey if you want to upgrade."
5,JBev34,"fun, and keeps my brain in check!, just wish it was a free app, because im maxed out on a budget and can‚Äôt even afford to add this in after my trial ends :/"
5,Niles60,I love this new brain application purchased very user friendly not over bearing making me feeling insecure
5,Mae Jean,I like this app because you learn a lot about how to speed up and keep mental math in your head. But you should not need Wi-Fi to use it.

5,Cheer champion,I love this app. It challenges you so you can get faster and better at math and problem solving. I would recommend this app.

5,jaymel44,This has been a very helpful app for me. I‚Äôm looking forward to experiencing some of the other things that the app offers.
1,cokerdrpepper,"This app features an experience that upon first use guides the user to enter demographic info and then buy a subscription. If you cancel out of the payment, then you are presented what I would consider to be a convoluted UX/UI that goads you into buying access to their games. The free games are garbage and merely exist to serve you ads using the info that you‚Äôve provided them."
5,patient27,Only had it a couple days but even the free version is cool. So many tests to take and interesting skills to improve. Definitely recommend!
5,kristin 8D,I‚Äôm in need of strengthening my brain in various areas after sustaining a concussion- this is easy enough to navigate and seems fun so far‚Ä¶ enjoying it!

5,The Honey Cloud,The games are entertaining while they still exercise my brain muscles.
5,Noeg17,Downloaded it a few days ago. Fun productive games. Definitely makes good use of a cell phone these days as opposed to mindless scrolling and dopamine binging.
5,Justin_ctrl,I use impulse to stay sharp. I also read and I am active in martial arts training on an average level. This app does help keep me well rounded.
1,violetefavor,"Why I‚Äôm giving one star is because after I unsubscribed,  you still charged me and because I have Apple, which is a corrupt system as well, I have to pay it even though I unsubscribe from you guys and then I have to wait to get my money back later. So that made me finally realize I‚Äôm getting rid of my iPhone."
5,Jip13,"Impulse is an awesome app. Keeps me engaged, constantly testing my limits, and enjoyable all around. I truly enjoy utilizing the app, and testing myself."
5,NSIN513,I love these short games that do seem to work in helping memory and focus. I find it entertaining but not a waste of time
5,Lahman Apple,"Absolutely love this brain game!  Highly recommend!  I bought the lifetime membership at 50% off, and I never buy game apps."
5,CSPicker,I got hit with a $50 charge. It says for entertainment only so the app isn‚Äôt approved for its intended use. I feel dirty after using this garbage.
5,Katri 53,"I love the short, very focused brain games. I‚Äôm 70, work part-time, in Bookkeeping and can definitely say this both relaxed and sharpens my focus!"
5,Jwicker,I‚Äôve only had it for two day now but it‚Äôs fun and gets my brain working in ways that are not always stimulated.
4,ilent2be1,I like this app. Fun tests to tell you more about yourself. Games that are not to hard and enjoyable to play. Everyone should give this a shot.
5,PhoenixLaRosa,I hate getting scored because it‚Äôs making me feel stressed but I hope to get over it somehow with a positive outlook.
5,beautiplug,I am in love with this game. Usually I don‚Äôt play Games but this one has a hold on me and I‚Äôm so fine with it because it‚Äôs helping me stay sharp!
1,nonickgame,"I initially loved this app when I first downloaded it but after the free trial period ended, there‚Äôs literally an ad after every challenge you complete which makes it so frustrating. Unfortunately I deleted this app because of the reason. Makes it unusable and unenjoyable."
4,Ksvendvdndd nd d,This is cool and all but there is way to many ads whenever I complete a level in a game. I want this game to have less ads because I just wanna play.
5,Increase of challenge,I enjoy the fact that difficulty increases as the different category puzzles change the more engaged I am
5,Dr. Flores-Garza,"While I have only played a couple of games, I find myself wanting to keep going"
5,pamerson9189,I have a high level of attention disorder and I paid for this training course because I want to improve myself. Improve my mental skills and self confidence
5,K.Ferguson,"Hands down! One of the best ways to challenge yourself! , three words! download it now!"
5,Ellie_s1668,I feel like I‚Äôm not just laying in bed playing a regular game. I feel like I‚Äôm playing a fun game that teaches me things about who I am while making me think.
2,SA543!,"I‚Äôve been using this app for almost 2 years, which shows an appreciation. However, with each update, there are more, not less, glitches. My impulse is to throw my phone during the extended delay between completing one game and moving to the next level!"
3,Banana dong,"The app is fine, however I don‚Äôt see any options to change my training program after the initial setup. Is this possible to do?"
5,Captain o‚Äô da word,All the games are very fun and really do challenge my brain. We like the  targeted approach to the categories that is easy to navigate with fun goals to reach.
5,Fun2Shop,This ap is a great way to train your and keep exercised. Look forward to doing the next training
5,No.1PC,U could do this all day but honestly it‚Äôs too easy doesn‚Äôt really make me feel smarter than the next guy
3,JayneR57,I use several apps to help improve my cognitive functioning. I heard good things about this app and tried it. I am disappointed that there is no iPad version. The made for phone app was unreadable by my aging brain and eyes.
5,VaneliHaze,"I enjoy playing the games before bed. All the games are fun, and helpful. I love knowing that I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking out‚Äù my brain and keeping it in shape with this app."
5,Jettboy1972,Love that it gives me a break throughout my day to do something other than my normal tasks‚Ä¶ Anything to keep my mind focused

5,IKE JP,Really helps you think quickly and not to hard or taxing pretty enjoyable would be good for kids and adults
5,Keritedford,I enjoy this app and I don‚Äôt even like facebook or Snapchat but this app really helps me focus and is worth paying for a subscription
5,BibiKim2,I start my day off with Impulse. I love the challenging activities and believe they are helping to exercise some of fine motor and cognitive skills.
5,Blessed Humble,The impulse app is very helpful. very good. The games actually making me smarter and making my brain so much sharper in every area. I absolutely love it and is greatful for this app.
1,900 rated guy,In the first 2 minutes of downloading the app they asked me 3 times to pay for a subscription. The cheaper option is $6.99 PER WEEK.  I took a different test during my free trial and they would not give me the results unless is paid for a subscription.   Misleading advertising. Deleted it right away.
5,RubyRoo702,"It‚Äôs very fun, easy to understand and it gives you insight on why you think and do the things you do in a very unobtrusive way. Love it!"
5,Mkboylan,Great brain games! When I‚Äôm consistent with playing them everyday I‚Äôve noticed it has helped me remember things I normally forget.
5,Ronnie1411,It feels like my brain is getting outside of school and I can learn whatever I want on it to make sure I‚Äôm ready for school
5,KymberlieMarcelle,Severe memory issues running my family. Just trying to keep my brain going.
5,chandlerky,If you love staying sharp this app is amazing for that. You‚Äôre learning and touching on things you‚Äôve learned in the past and keeping it fresh as well as advancing in it!   You need three things in your daily life to stay happy.  Mental stimulation/accomplishment  Physical stimulation/accomplishment Social stimulation/accomplishment   This app very clearly checks off my mental stimulation and makes me feel accomplished in that aspect
5,dajbjj,I really enjoy this app.  I was never a game person on my phone.  Great games that are fun and educational and keep you learning and sharp !
5,KLuv85,This app has already helped me maintain and grow my mental capacity in a fun way.  I am a Director of Engineers and the games help me stay sharper at work and in my personal life

5,JAGAIMX,"It‚Äôs really fun actually. I‚Äôve been enjoying it so far, definitely recommend trying out the free trial first. Everyone enjoys different games, ticks or whatnot."
4,1986kittycat,I would give it five stars but the personality tests (trauma for example) with the images are not available even after buying the app.  It was a simple questioner. The games are enjoyable.
5,Kelley Thomason,I enjoy doing these training exercises. They are not too hard and I am able to complete them
5,COOKYSnCREAM69 is my name,Just like my title says its free & pretty fun I assume u get more out of it if u pay but playing the basic games isn‚Äôt bad
5,Cowgirl@7,These work out games are so fun that you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre exercising your brain. Highly recommend.
5,Ms. Sickler,It‚Äôs like yoga for your brain! Easy games that actually help your brain instead of turning it off like many others. Love it!
5,AA3120,Really good way to help my short circuits. After a demanding day at work my brain is exhausted and my executive functioning is nonexistent. Helps get me balanced so my brain is less frenetic at bedtime
3,Iluvstormies,"I understand the need to make money to pay for the development of this product, but the free trial is not really free. You have to pay to get the results of tests. that false advertising just makes me distrust and dislike the product. Practice transparency."
5,Lizzy Riley,"I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been having brain lapses throughout the day. Forgetting names, zoning out, lack of concentration. This app really helps keep me focused and sharp."
5,Lil‚ÄôSiS‚Äô,"Impulse is a wonderful way for me to relax and let my brain have some much needed fun! I would enjoy knowing my scores, but it‚Äôs fun to me either way!"
3,Fiery Red Sunrise,"I signed up for the free trial. However, I cannot see any of my results. It keeps telling me to choose a plan to view the results. Basically that means I can‚Äôt view anything until the trial ends and I‚Äôm billed $6.99. That‚Äôs not how a free trial works and is pretty deceptive."
5,lizbecca,It‚Äôs better to do this than most other things I waste time doing on my phone; it‚Äôs set up really well too.
5,ND farm girl2,Enjoy using these quick games to keep my mind working.  Is nice tool for relaxing and taking mind off other things.
5,caro feild,It‚Äôs a game that push your brain to be fast but fun at the same time. Give you the tools that you can apply in the real world! Love it
5,TZtheScrub,Been great so far for brain exercises and some self reflection. Would recommend just for the daily consistent brain training.
5,MMNORTH,I enjoy the fact that there are many different games to choose from.

5,D7489,"This app has help me use my brain more than I normally do, reminding me of knowledge I seemed to have taken advantage of and forgotten. I really enjoy the app it is a very good eye opener"
4,Coley211,"Super awesome app so far, just wish I would use the full version without having to pay for it because the ads get frustrating."
5,Cytdiva,"Hey I really am enjoying this app. I have been struggling from a TBI, with short term memory issues. Impulse has helped a lot, besides being good entertainment during my recovery."
1,CareerWoman101,"I could not see my basic results for the ADHD test. You can sign up for a 3 day trial, but you don‚Äôt get any of your test results without paying and the app asks you to pay at every new screen. Deleted immediately. I might‚Äôve paid for a subscription if I got the chance to see any of the process besides answering the quiz questions."
5,ChanceFit,"I haven‚Äôt played long enough to reap the benefits, but it‚Äôs fun and the money is well worth my memory and smooth brain function."
5,RylieLK,It really is helping me with my brain development as an adult. Totally totally worth it. I have ADHD so this is so much better than medication . Fixing it naturally with games like this and clean plant base diet.
5,era585,A fun and engaging game my competitive spirit is engaged and i can feel my brain getting the challenge it needs to become stronger and more focused
3,dgherastovschi,Every app is the same. You can‚Äôt really get anything out of it but to watch ads to move further and you constantly get a pop asking you to subscribe.
4,LukeLovington,"This apps really helps me sharpen my brain for the day, I‚Äôve started to swap out all my doom scrolling for this app. Now during my downtime you can catch me playing a few games to sharpen my senses!"
5,Anna evolves,This is a way to take a break that actually helps you improve mental skills instead of zoning out.
5,SP00Ki_RagD011,"I rather play games that help keep you brain healthy, than the mind melting ones that have an add every 2 seconds!! Worth $6.99/week!"
5,fkruggoobnxjgdifkiyg,"Two days in and i already love it. Theres a great selection of puzzles & games, as well as data & statistics to keep you informed & encouraged"
5,M&M Ashley,Even the free version has games that truly provide a brain workout!
5,Swagger28,This app has really helped me retain information especially since I started back going to school. The games are unquiet and challenging
4,TupTuprocks,"This is quite a fun brain training tool as someone who has a cognitive disability. I enjoy doing this sort of sorting and memory work, it‚Äôs been too long since therapy. I personally enjoy this app!"
2,Scuba.Steveo,Every screen movement activates an ad of some kind. Want to turn off ads for $1-3 like most other apps? Nope. It‚Äôs $7 per week! Too greedy. No way this app is worth that price. This is a $5 app for the content it currently has. I‚Äôm deleting. It‚Äôs unusable with the amount of ads pushed.
5,JSerna101,I really enjoy the exercises and they don‚Äôt get old! The quizzes are also very interesting and the results are thought provoking.
5,Stimulated Acres,I find this entertaining to pass by the time and at the same time improving the ways my mind and brain work!
5,Sircy11,I enjoy the games to pass time with but I have actually noticed an improvement in memory.
1,wagnerke11,"The free trial is 3 days, not long enough to even form a habit of doing the program, and all the diagnostic tests are available, but YOUR results are hidden behind a paywall. Super unhelpful, super sneaky waiting until the last screen after 72 questions to try 3 times to charge me for the year to learn about my own ADHD. Will never use again."
5,Buff Brain Billy,I absolutely dig this app! Every day at work I play on my lunch break. Definitely notice the improvement in memory and problem solving.

5,Juliejjrae,"In all honesty,,I truly enjoy this app. I was looking for a brain workout and this app definitely gives that. Do recommend"
3,eheusk,Give me a break. You‚Äôre app isn‚Äôt telling people anything new. If you‚Äôre quicker and smarter then most then voil√† it‚Äôll tell you that. In percentages it‚Äôll tell ya if ya got it or ya don‚Äôt for 6.99 a week or month?! Get out of here and it should say right away not free
5,Avocadolvr,"I love this app. Even more I love the candy sort game. This is kind of silly but I wish there were sounds when I click on the balls. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èotherwise, I love it! Great app!"

5,12345764755,Way better than scrolling social media when looking for some time to kill!
1,creview22222,"I downloaded the app to take a quiz that Facebook suggested I take. I answered 40 questions only to be blocked by a paywall. The quiz did not say that payment was needed to get results and proceeded to ask me 40 questions. I suspect the results would have been interesting, but please be transparent and tell me if I need to pay before I invest my time. Thank you."
5,candisonestop,Thank you for making this game I would love to come to the headquarters and also this is really helping my brain

5,paul.palop,the problems are really well thought out and if you‚Äôre wanting to train for your next IQ test this is a fun way to do it.
5,lyschgril,Nice to be able to take a break and focus on something else for a few minutes
5,potatoes4days,I enjoy playing the games. I‚Äôve only had the app a few days but I feel like I‚Äôm going to make a point to play it everyday.
1,Genericpoptart,"Listen, if you‚Äôre going to claim all access during the three day free trial period, then trying to repeatedly charge for results of tests during that period is garbage. I don‚Äôt care how good your app is, this turned me off of it ten minutes in. Don‚Äôt ask users to commit for a whole year after the first few minutes of app use."
5,celesteee_,Impulse has a wide variety of brain games to choose from. If your goal is to challenge your brain on a daily basis then this is the game for you!!

5,Robert pgrass,This app helps me to reinsure my skills are not completely gone. This definitely helps
3,FishKitty$144,As I was in the app for a few days it started to go black and it wouldn‚Äôt open or display. I even updated the app and it still did the same thing. Not worth the price of the pro version
5,jakwjeis,"it helps with everything, it makes you ACTUALLY think about what your doing"
5,ehibbard62,I pick this up when I have the urge to go on social media or news apps. Great for simple brain sharpness.

5,reenaliz,Impulse is an amazing way to keep you‚Äôre brain active. The puzzles are great and a perfect way for young kids and adults to play to learn efficiently. Definitely recommend.
4,lola1485,"Discovered this app a week ago and I‚Äôm truly enjoying it. It‚Äôs highlighted my strength weaknesses and it‚Äôs teaching me how improve upon them. The only downside there isn‚Äôt a monthly membership, only weekly or yearly"

2,triockk,"Game could be cool, but the biggest thing that turned me off is the fact that they have tests you can take, but won‚Äôt give you the results of the test until you pay money.   Plus the game is littered with ads.   If you don‚Äôt plan on spending money, it‚Äôs not worth your time."
5,jerseyjungle,Highly recommend 10 out of 10

3,Hdgfjvfjvvnvdg,"Thank you for your games! However, saying an app is free and then riddling it with adds, not allowing main sections to be revealed without pay is a real turn-off. Disappointingly deceptive; enough so that I am deleting the app. Sorry guys."

4,Katie2.O,This is a great app i do feel that it is increasing memory and more BUT I kinda feel like most stuff cost money I do use free and it‚Äôs still good I would just appreciate more if more was free
5,Ohsee1,This game stimulates the mind no matter what time you play. It makes you think and recall many of the things you learned in grade school. I love it.
4,queensamybee,This is a really good game to get those brain muscles going. But I had to give a 4 star because there should be some free games to play not having to sign up for a subscription after 3 daysüò©
5,my old brain,I been doing only physical work at my work lately and I feel my brain is getting lazy but with this app I‚Äôm working out my brain
5,Rednative2,This helps with muscle memory and only takes a few minutes a day.
1,every nickname i is taken,"they don‚Äôt tell you it costs money weekly to do this,so you download it ,start answering questions, and then it tells you to subscribe to make payments. Don‚Äôt bother..there are so many apps like this out there for free. Save your money for a unique app/game that there is not 1,000s of free variants of already."

1,GamergirlXYZ03,"It is absolutely not okay that you download the app to play the game advertised and it doesnt even exist in the app!! Its like they made it up just for the ad. Then when you want to cancel, you cant!! They DO NOT have the cancelation button in the app so i just got charge $7 per week!! What type of app locks you into $7 a week to play some games! So disappointed. Save your money and time."
5,AnEcoScape99,Started simply to remind me of basics as well as p Rehearsing basic math.  Very soft but worthwhile review and correction of detailed reading and understanding rules that are required to be followed to get the correct answer.

5,jejjrhehfhfjuf,fun games while also help training the brain and has many more activities besides that.
1,EricLuke,"I‚Äôm not opposed to seeing ads while using the app for free.  However, an app designed for educational purposes has no business forcing political ads on its users.  If the app desired to address cold hard facts that‚Äôs one thing but I can not support an educational platform which is bias to one side or the other. This is the problem in politics today."
5,Comohoy,"I have been using this to help in my current employment, which is high stress and I need to be precise and efficient. This helps with that."
5,Lael1950,"Once I figure out how to play, I‚Äôm ok. Wish I could redo some, since I didn‚Äôt understand how to score properly in a couple."

2,JC0101010101,"I downloaded this app based on an Instagram ad that showed a childhood trauma test. It is nowhere to be found in the list of tests, and trauma & fight/flight response is not the same thing. I‚Äôm disappointed in the false advertising and it makes me not want to explore the rest of the app."

5,Chicago Commuter 60601,So far so good. Just tried it. It kept my inters and hopefully will challenge me through increasing levels of complexity.
4,Brina6877,"so far it‚Äôs amusing, but I don‚Äôt like the fees / costs to play.I am obviously trying out that free trial, but if after that, it cost money or cost money to be fun, I will not be keeping the app."

5,J0hnny_88,"I think the concept is really cool. Granted I‚Äôm new to the app, but I am looking forward to playing/developing more!"
1,Sierra6758,Really weird app. Why offer a free trial if everything is gated by starting a subscription immediately anyway? I would have been willing to try it out if it actually let me see the benefits of it during the trial. I spent 25 minutes on a test only to find it gated when I was on the free trial. So weird.
5,Reigh72,"Variety is great and as you complete levels and improve, the more challenging it gets"
5,hasjhqshas,Quick game to pass a few minutes
5,LHVACDaddY,I‚Äôve found this app to be pretty helpful and keeping my brain occupied and helping me retain more and relearn things I‚Äôd forgot. Pretty fun at times also.

5,Ozzydaslasher,"Its fun without a doubt, i just wish we didnt have to pay to use it, or atleast get features limited if you dont pay..."
1,SynNGrin,"Do not download.  I paid for a year and here is my experience. Games you see in ads do not exist in the app, even with paid membership. After 6 months of use, one update deleted all my progress. It even asked for age again. Nothing was left. No test history, daily exercises.. nothing."
1,kaylacaldwell,If I could give it a one star I would. It charged  me $30 when I did the one week free I unsubscribed and deleted it now my App Store says I have to renew my payment method to get any other apps because this one says I owe them another $30  I don‚Äôt have another payment method and I can‚Äôt delete my payment method since there‚Äôs a ‚Äúactive subscription‚Äùü´†
5,Butter Nut Scotch,"I understand apps can make money too, but not fair we can‚Äôt access certain things without paying. Good ole America."
5,Goingplatinum,I was a little skeptical of the program but have thoroughly enjoyed the ‚Äúpuzzles ‚Äú so far! Very challenging!!

5,Iscam02,I take a few minutes each day to start my brain and it keeps me focused at work.
5,Taje 101013,This work so well I feel so much better day after day thank you for creating this app!
5,DaniJoOhNo!,Love this app!! It‚Äôs fun and engaging!! Doesn‚Äôt feel like learning!! Anyone 7-100+ can play!! I also like the wide variety of games!!
4,elenafabiani,I couldn‚Äôt understand one game and it messed up my score but I‚Äôm sure it will reset it and I finally will have the score I deserve‚Ä¶not competitive at all üò¨ü´®üò¨
4,Mills808,"The brain training games are fun and addicting, having to pay for a subscription for full access is the only downer."
5,5ash2131,It is enjoyable and a good way to distract you from having to wait in line. Also leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment.
1,fluer7,The games themselves are mostly okay but only download this app if you‚Äôre willing to be constantly hounded by ads. You can‚Äôt go more than two turn on something without 1-2 mins of ads and on top of that the ads constantly launch you into a new screen you have to exit. NOT worth it.
2,kawboy250,"The puzzles are fun and challenging, but it comes at a cost. Constant ads between games and now pop up ads taking me to the web browser in the middle of a game ruining strategy and planning. Deleing the game never to return. I get they need to make money but now they lost an ad viewer by pushing it too much."
5,Cubano1977,This is a great app and not only keeps you engaged but gives you a feel of pride and confidence.
5,Kim mine,"I do enjoy the game. However, the ads are extremely long and annoying."
5,NeoGundammi5,This app is awesome not time consuming and helps me with my memory allot also helps me stay focused and very competitive against my previous scores

5,BeStill&Believe,I‚Äôm not usually one to waste time but it‚Äôs interesting how it works to keep my mind healthy and give me something positive to do with my time
5,RoeActive,"Instead of mindless scrolling, I spend some time to de-stress by doing some cognitive challenge exercises. Stress can lead to short attention span; this app exercise my memory and mental agility."
1,SerratedGrin,I only downloaded it to take the ADHD test that keeps popping up on Instagram to find out that I have to pay $5 or subscribe to find out the results. I uninstalled immediately after that. I would have given the app a chance or possibly subscribed if it wasn‚Äôt set up to waste your time in such a sleazy manner.
5,edvko,"Games all come in different shapes and colors. Some test memory, other quiz brain skills, other do so much more than I can say ‚úäüèºüî∏üñ§üî•"
5,Emily Herod,I love that the games and puzzles start out easy and gradually get more difficult. I do wish it was cheaper though.
5,Slow thinker308,This game has lots of different activities to work various areas of your brain.

5,rdod5,Look forward to this everyday to keep my brain sharp and it‚Äôs a great way to unwind after a long day
5,Huerfi,I like this app so far. It‚Äôs better to have this than other games because you learn and exercise your mind.
5,ldycakz,I have fun with this brain game and its the best one I have tried so far it has definitely helped my memory and improve focus.
1,IL1322,Very displeased in this app. It‚Äôs free to download but once you open it it tells you you either need a subscription or to do the free trial. You can‚Äôt do basically anything unless you pay for it which is ridiculous. Charge for the app or tell it straight forward. Very misleading. 10/10 would NOT recommend.
5,erp#1,"I am so happy with this app because it is different, challenging and guilt free!!! I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time playing games and it‚Äôs not repetitive! The price is reasonable!!!"
5,Aishasolo,I'm going to have setting a timer for how long I let myself do these exercises - and I hope I stick to the limit!!!
4,Dohsedoe,"I like this app because it shows how I compare to ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, so I have something to compete against! I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for it."
5,tazonx,Really helps me calm down at night. And my mind doesn‚Äôt run as much before sleep now
5,toni197111,It is challenging and difficult but I feel that it makes you use all of your brain.
5,Manfuel,"It is okay so far , I‚Äôm just wait for the harder games that tell you how smart you are or if you‚Äôre a genius or psychopath. I. Scent seen those results yet ."
5,Sav_pup,"Super fun but also super affective. I‚Äôve tried so many brain training games but fail to find a fun but affective one, till I found Impulse."
4,Hayden Wade 22,I just started playing so I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars. So far I like it. I‚Äôve had 3 brain surgeries so my memory isn‚Äôt great so if this helps me out I‚Äôll definitely give it a 5 star rating
5,DavidYork,Ok to do in small steps but takes time
5,Hailey's_HatredforPoptarts01,"I really like this game so far, I‚Äôve only had it for a day and it‚Äôs kept me occupied. also I wish I could take that day one deal"
5,Deanolevi,I have tried many brain memory and skill games this is a great app with a lot of skilled learning to help restore my brain injury from an accident

1,Piglady1992,I tried to take the IQ test with 60 questions. For every 4 questions there is an ad‚Ä¶.& some do not have the option to ‚ÄúX‚Äù out even after it‚Äôs done.  There are far too many to actually maintain a focus & accomplish anything. I deleted after only 1 time trying to take a test. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle & frustration.
4,trailrunner2011,"Love the challenges and goals that keep me working toward things. Price is reasonable for value. It‚Äôs frustrating that on the brain teaser games, the pictures are so tiny that I sometimes miss details important to solving the problems."

5,Cockdocktockk,Its actually like really good for a good brain work out especially early in the morning when you need to get ready for your day
5,Ally„ÄΩÔ∏è,It‚Äôs a really good way to help your to train your brain I‚Äôm only 10 years old and I really like this app
5,Daddysangbass,It almost seems to easy to be helping but it is.  My memory is improving and I generally feel sharper.
2,clrmom1215,"When I paid to get the app, there weren‚Äôt any ads. Now you can‚Äôt even do your daily training without having to watch a bunch of ads first. Or you can pay $40 to remove all ads for life. No thanks."
5,WWRJD,"If this app does what it claims, I can‚Äôt think of an easier way to boost your cognitive skills and gain confidence in your own abilities."
5,Gigi Buhrow,"As I have gotten older, I feel more scattered in my thinking. This game helps me with focus and following through."
1,vergillll,I have trial and I wnated to fill archetype questions. 72 of them! Filled it then couldn't even see my report before I pay for whole year! why isn't this being told before I take the test.   you wasted my time? now I am here making sure you get back a 1 star for it.
5,Aquino_robert,This app keeps you mind working instead of just entertaining. I believe is great to enhance and maintain your brain functions!
5,Helps my IMPULSE,This game is amazing! It helps me understand myself a little better and how I can train my brain to process things differently
1,je2848284728,"I followed all the instructions to cancel my free trial and there‚Äôs absolutely no way since I did it through the app itself and not App Store, the guidance says to press the cancel button (which doesn‚Äôt exist) or email (no one has replied to my several emails). The app itself is fun but I fear I‚Äôm being scammed. Please cancel my subscription!!"
5,Mackbruster,When I‚Äôm feeling anxious i open the app and start playing the games really soothes me.
5,G79!,Has fun games had a good pace and always something new and it keeps your interest
5,Rosapuffsmom,I like this because the tasks are interesting. Not having significant difficulty with any of them.
5,Tiffany2528614,At first I‚Äôm always hesitant about paying for an app. But I did the 3 day trial with this one and ended up paying the yearly amount. Satisfied customer.
2,Ngram113,The last update has ruined Candy Sort. The same color balls follow automatically even if you don‚Äôt want them to. There is a start delay. The final ball hangs in delay for around 10+ seconds before it will end the game. Really awful update.
5,Gogochic,Perfect for when I have a few minutes to distract myself
5,kathryn yx,I can feel it working and am enjoying the challenge
1,SamiSarahSelah,"The constant push to sign up for a paid subscription gave me an actual headache, as did the repetitive questions for the report that was held ransom for said subscription. It was like being trapped in a room with a money-obsessed toddler. Similar brain-building games are available for free individually. I did not pay; that, and this review, is my coping strategy."
5,Lynda Boo,"I need this and think it really help my brain! I just did the spatial test, math and it was just the right amount of hard"
5,sherha626,I am really enjoying this instead of playing usual games on my phone. This way I know I‚Äôm not wasting my time.
3,Mjo56765434,There are infinite restarts on all the games. I feel like with the timed games (especially if it‚Äôs your daily workout) you shouldn‚Äôt get infinite redos because it makes the stats comparing you to others super inaccurate.
5,Crazytangoorsalsa,The games are fun and intuitive. The ads just play too long.
5,Svdc27,I really like it gets my mind going instead of endless scrolling I‚Äôm playing games that make me think
4,LarkinSkye,There are several tests and assessments within this app too. This is well worth the low subscription they charge. One of the best apps I have ever used.
5,Charlotte üêº,It is the game I look forward to in the morning when I wake up. I am only 10 years old and it relaxes me and I love it. For all people who are reading to see if it is good IT IS THE BEST!!!

2,ConfusedChaos0o,"I was looking forward to this, but you can‚Äôt do anything unless you pay. Which I understand, but it could have said something about having just a 3 day trial. I was quite sad to answer all questions and then just have to delete the app."
5,SaS2381,"I‚Äôve used other apps to try to train my brain, however, this app is different in a good way. I actually like it. Good job."

4,Woopsin,This app is really amazing and fun I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like with the full version but I am glad that you can do 1 full purchase instead of doing a subscription
2,Can't signup acorns,"They‚Äôll collect your data and responses, but won‚Äôt share the results with you unless you agree to pay them. It‚Äôs practically data for ransom. Two stars. Not interested in keeping this."
4,Queenleighrouse,"Helps me to relax and unwind, gives me an alternative to scrolling through the depths of social media all while working my beautiful brain"
3,nugget man 321,It‚Äôs so good and helpful but I wish I could see test results without having to pay money. Being honest I think they could do really well without all the purchases and adds

1,Paulettelee,This is my within 24 hour notice- I want to cancel  Read through terms of how to cancel hyperlinks do not work.  Going through App Store to cancel as the terms suggest is also not an option.  Instead of being scammy how about a cancellation button within the app?  Now there‚Äôs a concept üò°
1,Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus.,Unless u plan on subscribing to the app u won‚Äôt get much out of it. I saw an ad talking about find out ur personality type or whatever. Sure I‚Äôll check it out. Download it sit there completing the test. Then the magic moment of it tallying up my score for the grand reveal‚Ä¶ all for it to tell me to subscribe to find out what it is. No.
5,[SNARKCORN],I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with the different games they offer. Unsure of the effects yet but I will update my review when I find out!
5,Ion333333333333,"Unlike the other brain training games, impusle has few ads and has actually helped me"
4,2023kerry,App started including a game from somewhere else that I didn‚Äôt recognize (had a cartoon King). And then froze when I tried to close it. So I deleted Impulse app and started over.
2,BrownieLocks29,"I mean I understand having ads in free versions of apps, but this is extreme with an ad after almost every few second activity. It makes me not want to pay for it just bc it‚Äôs such a sneaky way to get people to pay. üòè"
5,BuckElwood,I only have the free version so the adds are not fun at all but when I do get to play the games they are very fun and challenging.

5,mommyshark0622,"The games fun, and even addictive! I love seeing my progress and I love that they‚Äôre all in on app with no ads!"
4,lucky gander,"I‚Äôve played similar apps like elevate brain training and I feel like this one holds up and is well made. I like that it explains benefits of games, but it‚Äôs too early for me to know if they are really helping me."
4,Iceolated1,"I enjoy the tests this app comes with! However, I am unhappy that it promotes certain tests on social media that isn‚Äôt in the app when you look for them. That is very disappointing."

3,Zozmael,My free trial was supposed to be for three days but it‚Äôs already having me pay for a yearly sub when I can‚Äôt pay until next year. Yikes. Also I don‚Äôt see the image tests that attracted me to this app from the Facebook ad.
5,Daisymae665,I enjoy spending time here bc I am at least ‚Ä¶ do something good for my brain‚Ä¶ instead of endless scrolling in other apps
5,Insomniamania,"After suffering from an injury that is causing memory issues and slowed cognitive activity, this game is helping me to slowly improve my abilities."
1,Donald12306,"I would rate this great, but upon winning a prize for 92% off i wondered as to why it was still 30 dollars, when it said my total was .52 cents. well i try again and it tells me that it‚Äôs .52 cents per week which adds to 30 per year. which means i didn‚Äôt get any discount what so ever which is false advertising. so count y‚Äôall‚Äôs days."

But it gets worse, I don‚Äôt even have access to the app that they charged me $80 for. I tried to click ‚Äúrestore purchases‚Äù and nothing‚Ä¶I got swindled cold heartedly.

1,nickysl westfeather,Great app but I updated it and lost my streak so I don‚Äôt like this unless they give me a restore streak button. And everyone who complained just got the same customer support thing if you have problems talk to this email address and we might be able to help why don‚Äôt they just help right away instead of wasting everyone‚Äôs time.

1,patrickg5859,Trial version doesnt allow the user to see their full report/analysis when answering questionnaires. I answered 40 questions before being told the results would only be revealed to me if I subscribed.  How are we supposed to determine if we want to pay a subscription for your product if I have no idea I will even like it?

5,Navy Wife 12,I look forward to playing at the end of my day. Really helps me think but relax at the same time.

5,DANNY ($) 18,This a great app because help you to get a better understanding  and improve your way of thinking üí≠
1,averyboiii,"Money making scam, it‚Äôs the same type of tests you get on facebook ads but with clever sounds, haptics, and graphics that make it cute.  They force you to pay a ridiculous subscription of 7$ a week or $30 a year (this is advertised as a 92% discount of course)   After you do your test that just took you 10 minutes to take, they only show you a portion of your results and once again ask you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to see the rest ( this is after already having the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù, the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt give you any sort of access to the app‚Äù   Junk, dotn get it."

5,Saphyer,I just started using Impluse and so far I am enjoying this app. I will circle back after longer use and reevaluate.
1,DelaneyDMM,The free trial to this app is not a free trial. The moment you do tests (complete 72 questions and waste your time) it hides the results & tries to force you out of the free trial and pay annually or for a full week. What is the point of offering a free trial if you don‚Äôt let subscribers utilize it? You‚Äôre taking our info and not providing the results unless we pay.
5,DRKKNIGHT83,Excellent app instead of scrolling on social media this app gets your brain thinking and working! Very good range of tasks and games.
5,wild cats lacrosse 44322,It helps me so much that I now have a goal I do it everyday and that is making me feel stronger thank you so much
5,My nameüòÑ,This game is amazing I don‚Äôt have much to say but it‚Äôs helped a lot. I can focus better and remember stuff more! Hope yall enjoy this game too
1,Me123246,I thought this looked interesting so decided to try the ‚Äúfree trial ‚Äú they app immediately removed $22:99 from my bank account ! Its supposed to be free for 3 days then $6:99 a week. On what planet is this free? It‚Äôs actually fraudulent and I will be reporting this to Apple. I also tried to contact the company and it doesn‚Äôt let you send messages. Beware! Total ripoff!
5,Kid RocStar,"There are some things that are good for you and some things that great for you! Impulse is great for you, I love using the app to really get my thoughts going and a good grip on my day."
5,Bear's Belle,I‚Äôve found that it is helping get more focused. I do it in the morning to help stimulate my brain before the day begins.
5,MDJüòä,I am having fun while keeping my mind busy have many interesting games to choose from.
1,avictorymaker,"Every couple of seconds, I felt like the app was asking, ‚Äúupgrade?‚Äù And ‚Äùupgrade?‚Äù. I considered it until I took the adhd test and it said in order to get the results I had to upgrade. It was clear to me at that point, it‚Äôs only about the money. For a minute I thought I found and app that could help point me in the right direction in life. Nope"
5,Angelshock,"I had a great round in the free trial, but I know the next levels will get successively harder. Looking forward to giving the old noggin a workout."
1,S4x1,"For any of the various tests or profiles contained in this app, there are many free alternatives one quick search away.  The ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt unlock results until you pay - bait and switch.  In fairness, there are a number of profiles in a single app with a good design here - but with a little effort, you can find other resources without privacy concerns or an expensive subscription to unlock results- and with transparency re: validated sources.  Ultimately, I can‚Äôt think of a good reason why anyone would give this app publisher access to their personal data, correlated with personality profiles‚Ä¶.  Yikes."
5,reversole23,Using this app to break the habit of doom scrolling in the mornings. Puts my head in the right space every time.
5,Hopethiswashelpful,So far it‚Äôs been a good addition to help keep my brain sharp. Enjoying learning more and trying new things.

5,mashik_a,We‚Äôre on our phones all day anyway might as well do something useful
3,ARMYWIFE 86C3D2,The lifetime purchase option disappeared after I selected to try the trial version. I‚Äôd rather own something I can play for life than pay monthly. Was disappointed as the app is fun and has some great games to unwind.
5,ray22233trill,"great app , i love how adds dont just pop up, and i can play non stop mini games that test my brain power."
5,arhDdGdgeagd,"I think impulse is fun, because you get to do mental activities on your phone, and you get achievements, and good scores! They have math, identical objects,matching, and more! To: App Store & impulse. <3 :)"
3,Bzmie3,"The exercises and tests are helpful, however, many of these tests that I see on various social media ads, as well as on the App Store page are no where to be found in my app. Yes, I have updated the app. I have the paid PRO version."
2,Dcgal23,"There are some games that are interesting/fun, but be aware that there are adverts for Archetype tests that do not exist in the app.  For example, I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúfemale archetype‚Äù test advertised in several places (Facebook/instagram, etc) but the test is not on the app.  I‚Äôve noted similar comments from other users elsewhere."
5,Chi3.29,"Love this app! Sharpens my clarity and thought processes, making the daily work stress load much easier to handle."
5,Dadmc55,"Impulse brain games are fun and have a lot of variety.  Most other games are annoying with lots of flashing treasure chests, gems, jewels, coins, and noises. Impulse brain games are the best!"
5,Genesis_Fides,Too new to really rate it.  Developers should wait for a while before asking for feedback
5,Joyful525,"I love a challenge and although it starts out easy, the increasing difficulty makes me just want to play more."
5,Party-bee,Honestly so much fun and so many game options. It‚Äôs like cool math for adults. It makes me feel less bad about being on my phone for it.

4,gleaning2day,"I decided I need some brain games to sharpen my skills. This seems to be appropriate for what I need. Some things are more challenging than others, especially when I‚Äôm tired! Lol"
1,Meaningful Miles,"The quizzes where super bad. They just kept repeating the same questions reworded, I could learn more about myself with a buzzfeed quiz. They kept having these pop up ads to pay a subscription. And only told me I could get my results after I did the quiz. Don‚Äôt waste your time it‚Äôs a scam"
5,EddyEd12,I enjoy doing all the fun little activities while also knowing that it‚Äôs all helping to keep my mind sharp and active.
5,crabree,Because it‚Äôs engaging and I can go at my own pace. I would like it better if it synced between my phone and iPad

5,Mrs. CBroussard,"Seems like fun and may be helpful in cognitive preservation. I‚Äôll keep exploring, for maybe a week, to see if it‚Äôs worth the small investment."
1,Jrol12334567,Constant ads. I did a 60 question IQ test and at the end of it they ask for money instead of giving my results.

1,12484924,This is not the first time this has happened with an app. I wanted to take the IQ test and after around 10 minutes I completed. Thinking it was completely free I was shocked to find out that I had to buy ANOTHER plan not on top of my already existing one. I wish you just said that before I answer 60 questions.

1,Joseph Reyna,I‚Äôm all for testing the limits of our brains. However it‚Äôs somewhat annoying that these is a subscription based game.

5,2handycaptandcoke,I specifically set the two skills I wanted to work on and the skills that showed up on my first day were the two I DID NOT choose. The exercises were dumb and mindless.
5,Vfvtdtfugyft,I have been having my grades drop but now they go up not down
4,Sierra4563,Honestly the app itself isn‚Äôt bad at all! The quizzes are great but super disappointing that you have to pay 6.99/week. For people who can‚Äôt afford it. Other than that great!
5,Angie G 17,Different exercises for each day. Lots of quizzes to get to know how you‚Äôre wired. Great app overall. Oh! I like the puzzles too.
5,crazy cheese curds,"I think I have learned about myself, I found out stuff like maybe I have A.D.H.D, and maybe I‚Äôm too selfless. in just the first two days I‚Äôve learned so much."
5,jeannie Bikini,It‚Äôs a brain teaser that I use almost every day in normal course of my duties it is helping me concentrate and more quickly respond to number sequences.j
5,Kat the Bat!,I am loving the games on this app. This is my first app with games. I have only had it for 2 days but I find it very engaging and fun!
3,DeeDan1293,"nothing out of the ordinary here. With the amount of apps out there that do the same, it‚Äôs just another chip off the block to be honest. Is it worth the subscription.. that‚Äôs up to you but definitely nothing that stands out."
5,JUJu-101,Fun app but gets to the point challenges your brain to excel past previous limits and perform much faster and smoother that‚Äôs why I love this app
5,TheGreatReviewer46678,The games are never to hard like how it tells you how much you accomplished from the rest of peers

5,Bladmaster2,good game lots of fun. Enjoy the challenge also relaxing definitely recommend giving it a try.
1,AuDhd83,An endless loop of links brings me in circles when I try to cancel. It does not appear as an Apple subscription or in my apple account and no one answers emails when requesting cancellation. Three months and an extra $60 later and I still cannot get an answer. I guess I have to close my bank account?
5,Keglor,I love this app and the variety of training drills. I especially like that it gives your score in comparison to others.
5,lindseytron87,"I‚Äôm glad I bought the annual membership, I want to track my brain training activity and I like the quizzes and puzzles."

5,big05,been very happy with this app and what it can do for you mentally I‚Äôm 55 and want to do all I can to be mentally aware this app is doing the job.
3,AppleClient1555,The games are childishly simple. It seems like it‚Äôs meant for around 10-14 year olds. Especially with their chosen design scheme. Might look elsewhere if  you‚Äôre really looking for something to push cognitive boundaries a little.
5,Jacey2012,"I personally love this game. It‚Äôs very relaxing, yet challenges your brain on all different levels. Definitely recommend it!"
5,DeeLee4,"I don‚Äôt play games often like I used to, but I love that this game encourages me to expand my mental skills outside of my day to day activities."
5,SelfLove14,It make me so happy and excited to know now I have this app to help me with my life struggles  I would recommend this to any one  Thank You

5,BarbaraGem2026,this app is amazing. i have adhd so normal tasks that are boring are hard for me. another part of adhd is that you can get super focused on tasks that are fun and the person can do them for hours on end and never get bored or distracted. this app helps me channel that and i recommend to all adhd people or anxious people because it also helps relieve stress. i recommend
5,Coffee Playa,It is definitely better than most things people are tempted to kill time over!

5,Joys321,These games are fun to keep four brain sharp. I‚Äôm loving all the games and working different areas of the brain.
3,Laura JR,"Although I believe this app is probably helping me with memory and concentration, a lot of the tasks are very similar, like rearranging liquids in bottles versus rearranging discs on newels. I've found a few that I enjoy, but would love more variety."
1,ChristinePA19083,You spend some time answering tons of questions to learn it‚Äôs free for 3days and after that you have to pay. Feels misleading to call it free when it‚Äôs only free for 3 days and then you‚Äôre on the hook. I uninstalled immediately but not sure if that canceled the free trial that automatically turns to be being billed at the end of said trial
5,Weirdo#12,This helps me with my anxiety and challenges me with fun games.I would recommend this game if you have anxiety or want to challenge yourself.
5,DullerTagg,"I‚Äôm not sure how effective it‚Äôll be yet, but it‚Äôs a fun little activity to pass some time. Hopefully it actually has some positive impact."

5,LeftfootBlue,I really enjoy the brain building games and the tests provided a lot of insight into my brain and motivations behind some of the things I do.
5,Future Mrs. Lamb,I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôm lost in these exercises instead of scrolling Facebook or Instagram.

5,sumshinelife48,I like it until it makes you pay for it
5,soozcat,The games are great! There‚Äôs always something new to challenge your brain.
2,FilthyToxin,"Its a good app, but i wont rate more than 2 until you make more stuff free. You could make more money from adding advertising and making people pay to remove advertising and add premium features for premium members only. Just some food for thought"
5,Pnutrn1442,I can tell a difference after only using a few times.
5,Shanalashea,I‚Äôm not being paid at all to write this I honestly love this app they have lots of options for people and it‚Äôs good for you

5,N0ch3,"I like it , and I like how my brain focus, I‚Äôd rather be playing and feeding my brain than scrolling through social media"
1,huhffhsisj,Why you gotta pay to do anything man. I ain‚Äôt wanna unlock everything I‚Äôd rather just stick to the basics or free stuff but there‚Äôs no way to pass it. You HAVE to pay or do a free trial. It‚Äôs stupid when you could just get other 100% free apps and games that do the exact same thing as this would. Honestly just go take a buzzfeed test or something.
5,Niquemdgasc,"I only have the free trial but, I like it. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs working because today makes two days so as of now I like it. Games are easy."

1,didnekdiwl,"One of those apps that seem free to download then hits you with a paywall . It asks you a million questions, then at the last second asks for you to pay to use the app, essentially wasting your time. Hate this kind of tactic and you should avoid it if you do too"
5,sassylove600,It should be free like make it make sense to pay to get smarter but otherwise it‚Äôs fine I understand y we gotta pay but it‚Äôs so dumb
4,Maish 05,I have had similar apps before but this one has some interesting games so far and I will give a more detailed review after a few months.
1,Dane sperman,"Downloaded the game, was forced to subscribe after a few great levels, then got stuck playing the absolute worst game ‚Äúcandy sort‚Äù for 100 levels, couldnt do anythinh but play the most boring game over and over and over and over and over and it never ended. Do not download. Do not fall for being forced to subscribe."
5,J Leake,I love this app! It‚Äôs great for different areas of the brain. You can custom what you want your focus to be and go from there! Def recommend this app!!

5,Jnl2211,"If you‚Äôre the kind of person who enjoys quick mental games, this app is perfect.  Short, fun, and good for your brain!"
1,Hercules8D,"Another app that is free to download and you get hit by the paywall immediately. Before you create an account, before you even see a test, before they even show you what a test looks like, they want their subscription money. The app didn‚Äôt load properly twice while trying to launch it the first time."
5,Matthew019b,I have adhd and idk if it‚Äôs even relevant but I find this app very helpful it helps me focus and I also find it fun. This app will honestly help anyone who gets it
4,ToastDilly,I‚Äôve tried many brain skill games and all of them are pretty fun but expensive. This one is a slightly better price but I say the game are somewhat more fun to me
4,Ivelisse05,I like this brain game but after a while you kind of get bored with the same daily training. They should update it and add different ones.
4,babyyoda36,Great app has really helped me the one think I dislike about it is the fact that it is advertised as fee but you have to pay like 30 dollars for it.
3,perfect_c00kie,"These are fun mini games to play, but I don‚Äôt feel they offer much mental challenge (which was what I was looking for). I will stay with Lumosity and Elevate which I like better for that purpose."
5,JaybaeG,So far so good to me if you like stuff that helps you with your brain then this is for you üòä
5,cirith√ªng√∂l,"I have short term memory loss. Playing this game, I‚Äôve been remembering a bit better. Even though I was very skeptical at first."
5,SamChuck87,I‚Äôve been casually playing this and so far have enjoyed it sporadically here and there. Not terribly ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù but provides bursts of satisfaction in oneself. Job well done!
5,Elesun,"Basic level seem to be available without a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù. So far it‚Äôs great. Has adds, naturally."
5,Snake9852,"Can be annoying with requiring money, however it is nice to play and helps keep your mind sharp."
5,Reggie37Boi,"Love it hate the adds, not paying the price to remove the adds though ugh"

2,Jaynietzsche,"This app is‚Ä¶ mildly entertaining, but the claims that it will improve memory or other brain functions are not backed up with any evidence. There‚Äôs basically no reason to think it will actually do so.  Waiting til you download then asking for $7/WEEK is laughable. Very annoying."
5,bdjfjdk dndksnsmms,Such an awesome app to use everyday to really get your mind off the daily life and get you thinking.
1,Katie Ln,"My 30-day free trial only lasted 5 days. Also, there was no way to enter the correct answer on brain teasers, so how can it count whether or not my answer was correct. 5 star app brought down to 2 stars for misleading.  Update to developer: I don‚Äôt think you read my review. The 30-day free trial is over after only 5 days. I cannot proceed without paying or trying the three day trial. One star."

2,Rocksky,"Today the app crashed after 3 seconds of being open. I won‚Äôt be able to continue my streak today, which means I probably won‚Äôt be back to train tomorrow. Reliability is the primary feature of any piece of software, Cypriot or not."
5,Cinnamon and cheese,I saw it on a TikTok ad and didn‚Äôt have high hopes but tried it anyway and it‚Äôs great. Way better then expected
5,tkaska,"I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd enjoy the games, but they‚Äôre actually enjoyable and relaxing at part of my evening routine. Highly recommend!"
2,DangerRodriguez,I don't mind paying for things but I'm not gonna commit until I know whether it's worth it. I've been wanting to try this app so I was stoked to see a free trial. But then I take one test and it still says I have to commit to a subscription just to see the results. That's not a free trial.
5,LCLVSC,This is just generally fun and I get little messages that say where I sit in my age group. Which is just a cool little extra.

5,Red Vixxxen,The games are great brain teasers to get your mind going and moving.  It helps kick off my other creative sessions or relax before bed time
5,TokingIrishman3,"Ive been really enjoying impulse ! , I feel like this app has helped greatly with my memory specifically ."

5,Iron Mannnnnnnnnnn,Second day it‚Äôs all good nice sounds found out my iq is normal so take that Mrs Johnson my iq isn‚Äôt bad because I guess and got a 5th grade reading level
5,Koalahapy,It‚Äôs a really fun brain game I love it if u have Duolingo it‚Äôs kinda like that it had the day streak and mini games inside it‚Äôs just a really fun app in my opinion
1,Tacit-Bud,"First they bait you with all the offered/available perks they offer. Then they scrape your information with the ‚Äúgames‚Äù they run you through in the initial run of the app, to gain additional data from you to later then monetize. And then, to view your results of those initially performed tests, they then ask you to pay?  Good one! üòÇ"

3,cataybee,Things seem so easy not sure it‚Äôs helping me maintain a healthy brain but maybe it is.  I‚Äôm only in the three day trial time so it‚Äôs hard to say.  I might not continue with it but I do want to exercise my brain in unique ways.
4,Addi_rose13,"So as I been playing this for about couple months, it's helps with concentration and I‚Äôve been focused in classwork, so it‚Äôs a really good tool so I would recommend this app"

5,Shazza shabam,Just started it some days ago it‚Äôs fun I‚Äôm just waiting to see if it actually helps
2,Gabe Greyson,They‚Äôll let you take a whole test and then give you a pay wall to see the results. They‚Äôll let you sit there and waste your time. You couldn‚Äôt just not made the test available. Untrustworthy and shows a glimpse into the developers real motives.
5,Big mamma G,I like Impulse because it‚Äôs different from all the other brain exercise apps I‚Äôve tried before.
1,NikkiJ2448,They offer a 3 day free trial but then require you to join a membership after each test you take to see the results. I can‚Äôt give an honest feed back on the test because I‚Äôm not paying for an app I‚Äôm not sure will benefit me at all. Downloaded this app today and will be deleting today! Don‚Äôt waste your time!
5,Baby blues mom,I have been not remembering things and I know it is because I‚Äôm getting older. This app is really helping me! Glad I have it!!!!!

5,Fun and brain!,I look forward to the challenges each day and love the other games!!
1,tofumu,Constantly asked to pay before being able to use the app. I cannot access all the information even in the free trial. It‚Äôs not worth paying if I don‚Äôt know if the quality of the information or activities they provide are even worth the price.

5,Tinmasch,It‚Äôs great to see the variety of the games. I like them and have been challenged too.

1,@SEXY_xtc,I signed up for the free trial and did my first test and it wouldn‚Äôt show me my results until I paid for a subscription to the app..?!

1,Eightequalsd wxm,"They say ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù but anything worth seeing (reports on your personality type, IQ, etc.) that they have advertised requires you to make an advance purchase. The true amount you‚Äôll have to pay to get anything useful out of this app is  is $24/year or $7/week. I think this is just annoying and shady."

1,whutevvuhh,"I wanted to test out this thing and it seemed really cool but then after the archetypal test it wants to charge me for the results m Like bruh a free trial should be a free trial, not something just said but still have zero real access to anything  Garbage for misleading their free trial so I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm really into it and don‚Äôt think I should spend the money on this"

1,Jdunavan,You can't access pretty much anything worth while with out paying. The free trial doesn't give you full access and ends up charging you even after you canceled it. Insane amount of ads. Scroll through the almost 500k reviews and look at the 5 star reviews. Tell me thats real people

1,MrsLilBerg,They trick you into thinking you can do all these personality tests while using the free trial so it lets you do a ten minute test with 72 questions and then at the end it tells you you have to subscribe immediately and it‚Äôs $6.99 A WEEK. That is not worth it for some low grade quizzes. Immediately deleted the app. Seems very gimmicky.

1,Rosegovia86@,"This is a scam, check online the amount of people who have been scammed by this people. You download the app, you go to the trial version and they tell you they will charge you after the 3 day period and automatically they grab from your card not only one but 2 times the amount!  Ive been charged for a weekly and a yearly subscription a total of 35usd! And i used it for 20 min.  Please never download I realized and cancel through thw Apple subscription the trial period the same moment, and they charged me anyway and the app came back by it self to active subscription! Awful"

2,Docbrotherman,"Just like soo many other apps, they want cash weekly or monthly without starting upfront what the deal is. That‚Äôs just bad form in my book. Deleting the app on principle right now. Doesn‚Äôt even matter if it‚Äôs a cool game. If you fail to state the terms up front, why bother."
4,Nefariousgoon,"It‚Äôs really fun puzzles, I‚Äôm not gonna lie. If you try it and think ‚Äúthis person is lying, this is lame‚Äù keep in mind I‚Äôm also autistic, so my type of fun is probably different from yours lol"

5,mzflores+5,"I‚Äôm a busy mom of 4, and focusing is something I struggle with‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs calms me, makes me feel better to know I‚Äôm exercising my brain and I‚Äôm not so scatter brained all the time! It‚Äôs a great app!"

1,AL010101010101,"I did not pay for premium, so maybe it is better, but the free stuff is a joke and seems like it‚Äôs meant for a child. It is not challenging. They want you to upgrade for almost everything. For those who pay for the upgrade, I sure hope it‚Äôs a lot better than the free version. Deleting app."
4,LyLa.UR.bEstIe,So I saw an add for it on TikTok saying that it would tell me my iq and that‚Äôs why I downloaded it. It‚Äôs pretty much really easy mini games but it is still fun 7/10. Hope this helps

5,stefplus4,Impulse makes you come alive with your senses and your fingers working together and playing these games!!! Soo much fun

5,JoyaBeann,It definitely helps me in the mornings when I wake up. I love the many different games. It helps with my eye coordination as well.
5,Strykersaw,I‚Äôm finding it more enjoyable than just doomscrolling on my down time.
1,k176891!,"Don‚Äôt do the ‚Äúfree trial.‚Äù Not worth it for how quickly they start charging. Look at that cost per WEEK it charges + there are NO instructions for how to unsubscribe (which is through your Apple account btw). While it‚Äôs common to have automatic subscription after a trial, the fact that the app has no guidance on how to cancel leads me to think they are being intentionally difficult."
5,omarlol1,It‚Äôs honestly fun üëç hopefully I can write another review later down the line to see how it affected me but so far 10/10
5,KathrynsLens,"I got a deal to get it for $30 a year‚Ä¶ that is actually amazing. That's like food for 2, but its feeding my thoughts for a year ü§£"

5,Georgiared#1,Well here‚Äôs a game for you to keep you sharp and keep you using a memory
1,JohnsonvilleBrats,This app didn‚Äôt work. I cancelled right away and now they‚Äôre charging me. I disputed the charge and have proof I cancelled but it was declined. Went to app developer site and found out the company is in Cyprus and the contact support doesn‚Äôt actually do anything. Red flags everywhere. May cancel my Apple Card just to stop charges.
4,Tarzan0502,"Loving the app just if you don‚Äôt get the premium, you are hit with ad after ad, after every use."
4,Chunk-in,I was on the fence about this but it really does make you think ü§î about the little things you don‚Äôt think about in your daily life. It‚Äôs kinda fun ü§©

5,Lioness tea,I love it wasn‚Äôt too excited about the fee but I most definitely enjoy every level!!!!
1,Rocketemt,"This app does a bait and switch with its requirement for a paid membership. Instead of being upfront prior to downloading the app, they give the perception that they off a free version which they do not. Obviously a deceitful way to conduct business. Makes one think what other deceitful things do they do IF you get a membership."

1,Colby L,"Downloaded this app and it made me go through a long questionnaire just to tell me I have to subscribe in order to use it. It allowed me to do a 3 day free trial so I selected that option. Then I took an IQ test for like 15 minutes only for it to tell me AGAIN that I have to pay to see the results. Horrible app, don‚Äôt download!"
5,Tntowns,So far I‚Äôve enjoyed doing the test .. it makes it fun..  it I think it will help me keep my brain active.

1,MikiDraw,"This app is full of so much brain scratching games that really satisfied the itch, but sadly due to the constant pop up adds I deleted it. If maybe there was a one time payment depending on cost, I would have paid it.   Also maybe just make the adds less annoying and in your face."
5,Theeos,"I was surprised at how much some of these games seem to sharpen the mind, I am not a spring chicken, but I could see a steady increase in cognitive function."

1,vac1992vac,You will spend 5 minutes getting through their obnoxious advertisements that have nothing to do with you or your interests and lead you on a wild goose chase to the App Store just to finally be able to play a 30 second brain game that is subpar. Don‚Äôt use this app.

2,RedRaven523,The word guess game stopped randomizing words about 3 days ago. It stuck on the word ‚Äúworld‚Äù and does it over and over. When you close the game and go back in the same thing happens. I love this game and many others but this is very frustrating.
4,CsVme,I like being able to get a baseline then trying to improve over time. I want my brain operating at peak performance.
5,amyleepatron,These games are great and have helped me with recovery from a TBI. I unfortunately am unable to pay for add free play so it‚Äôs a LOT of adds but worth it for the benefits.

3,Heather5551,The games on this app are fun but the amount of ads on the free version are not worth it. You play one round of games and have to sit through a 30 second ad. It‚Äôs a waste of time.
5,Rita1970,I‚Äôm enjoying this app so far.  The first day I did better than 98% and the second time I only beat 11%

5,Pseudonimshik,ü•áü•àü•âü•â
1,joeeeeeeeemamama89,I am so tired of downloading puzzle games and constantly having to watch ads after every level. I think i‚Äôve spent more time watching ads than playing the games that would be ‚Äúhelping my wellbeing‚Äù   It‚Äôs also the fact that all the ads are the same thing. Over and over again they are showing the same game or even more puzzles.   I tried to play it on airplane mode to get rid on them but the app can‚Äôt even run correctly without wifi.   It‚Äôs actually insane that I would have to be paying $40 for no ads.

It‚Äôs highly annoying especially bc ppl are trying to legit learn and not play these stupid mindless games on the advertisement adds."

5,QAL 7,"In the best way possible, I don‚Äôt even prefer to play games on my phone but this has captured ny attention.  Very addictive."
5,Dandiiart,I am glad found this app and so grateful
1,Brock Olsen,Like every other money hungry app you need a subscription unless you‚Äôre okay with only being able to access a third of the app and have to watch a 30 second ad when trying to do anything it‚Äôs pathetic who in the right mind is gonna pay monthly to play puzzles cmon now.
5,TW32AH,This game is so much better than the mindless collecting and matching games. I play this at work on my breaks as a way to unwind but keep my brain active.
5,Dip ranch,"Love it, has many mini games that keep your brain active."

4,doesn't have attitude,The only issue I had with this game is like 12x8 I just didn‚Äôt think that was very simple to me but overrall definitely not bad
1,ArtiMano24,Absolutely unable to cancel subscription. Purchased through Apple and it does not show up anywhere for me stop renewal. Cannot seem to find a customer care number as well to contact regarding cancellation. And then it turns out it's not just me but so many others have been in similar situations.
5,Mike El Angelo,"Games are really good at not letting your mind get used to a pattern, it can be easy and then get tricky all of a sudden"
4,3.786950,This app is really fun and it‚Äôs a great way to increase brain function. It wants you to pay for a subscription but you can easily X out and play for free each day.

5,Drdfungi,Just started working with the app and I find the games challenging and stimulating. It will be interesting to see how I improve day by day.
5,kristilynnswoger,I suffer from ADD and general anxiety disorder and this app definitely helps for when I‚Äôm fidgeting or if I can‚Äôt focus. Highly recommend!
5,Zingycat,I have ADHD and got this app to see if it could help with focus. It‚Äôs a fun app so far. I hope that with continued use my focus and memory will improve much
3,Thehillsofgeorgia,The developer has screwed up this App with Ads‚Äîeven after I purchased premium to avoid the ads.  But there they are.  Very disappointed.   Bait and switch.
1,Mary Kate Randolph,"THIS IS A PAID APP if you want to do ANYTHING, wish i knew that before it made me take a super long test just to not find the answers. I loved the idea of improving my brain but i also need to improve in saving money and i cannot pay for every little thing on every app."
5,MichiganMom13,"I have tried many brain training apps over the years, but this one is THE best! It offers honest insights and is actually fun!"

1,Seeks285,"All this app does it make you better at the games they have, rather than actually training your brain. Additionally, they waste your time by letting you participate in things and then you need to pay an additional fee just to see the results. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this garbage."
5,slojhand,My concentration is going up incriminates day by day every time I use the app.

1,www.she.work,"I downloaded this app. The system was saying three days trial, and they charged me a whole year without even asking, instantly. Same day! Same hour! Unbelievable! And I am reading all of the other comments. People have the same issues. I will report it to my bank now."
5,Brooklynboo1da,Pretty useful for keeping my mind sharp im not a fan of paying weekly for apps but this one is worth it the challenges progressively get harder but it‚Äôs fun
1,Graces81,"I saw an ad for the app and was immediately interested, so I downloaded. I opened the app and answered a few easy questions about my goals. Then‚Ä¶time to enter payment information. This isn‚Äôt to go as free or get extra perks or unlock special games. You have to pay monthly just to play at all."

5,travelinggrl,This is my go to when I have a minute or two.

5,Scorey's iPhones,"This app not only lets you know where you‚Äôre at with respect to the specific tests, but it‚Äôs fun as well! I‚Äôm hooked."
4,sappo98,But how accurate are the iq tests? I took the quick one and general one and it seems like the scores may be a bit inflated than what they actually are. Im really not that smart but the scores they gave me were very high.
5,PediCNS,Frustrating. I want to cancel Immediately but cannot find info to do so.
2,Zenith 9,I just wanted to see what this app was. Signed up for the weekly with the free trail then it goes and offers discount for a yearly subscription which I accidentally bought. I feel so scammed‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even find the game that made me download it in the first place.
1,Emily lilac Johnson,Don't subscribe!! To get the 30 day money back guarantee you have to use the app for 20 days in a row and document it. I signed up for some testing that was advertised on Instagram and the purchase path was simply full of lies and false promises. This is a fraudulent company. Customer service did not help
5,reyaaallen,Download this app if you want to divert your attention from social media. This keeps your brain working healthier.
4,Honeybl00d,"Pretty good so far. I‚Äôve only used the app a couple of days and I noticed some typos and grammatical mistakes on some of the quiz questions, but overall a good app so far."
2,Voidable1,"Like most apps these days, if you do not pay weekly, monthly or yearly fees you‚Äôre inundated with un-skippable ads. This app takes in a conglomeration  of other ‚Äúfree‚Äù apps and mashes them all together.  It‚Äôs ok for what it is, but if you do not pay you will go crazy using this app"
5,openEnmity,"Day 2. It is engaging, if not simplistic. Looking forward to seeing what else it does and where it goes from here."
3,LoNicole26,I had been two weeks into training and then had to get a new phone. When I redownloaded the app it did not give me an option to login and forced me to start over.
5,Carlo benitez,You can mindlessly play games and develop ur brain to react in situations better suited for your needs and interests in life

5,Not my Type of Hypr!!,I truly enjoy these games as a woman going through menopause and brain fog. They are helpful to build my memory and keep me sharp.

5,BDR69420,Best app to help your brain I totally reccomend I‚Äôm 13 years old and this helped me memorize school work for tests homework and assessments 5 stars.
5,devils.advocate,Lots of games to choose from. Always better than scrolling!
2,"queen11,","I was beginning to sign up for this app, and I was getting really excited. I did the entire quiz, just to be faced with either 7$ a week, 40 a year, or 50 for lifetime. I was really interested, and now I‚Äôm not. Thank you for inspiring me to go find other games like yours, that are free."
5,Ataira,I can‚Äôt attest to whether it helps your brain or not ‚Äî I‚Äôm no scientist. But the games are quick and easy.
3,pondergirl,"I‚Äôve gone through and completed multiple games. It says you guys are going to add new versions, but it‚Äôs been 6 months and no updates on the individual games. Very bummed."
5,danjosam,"I like the very specific variety of games for focus and reaction speed, memory training, etc."

1,Bugystay89012356,"Tried to do three day trial and got charged for annual subscription. Immediately tried to refund, end the subscription, and delete, but it says ineligible for refund. So had the app for about 24 hours and got charged for a year. Refunds should be available if immediately deleted/subscription ended."
3,nerkles,"Please enable family sharing, this is too expensive to pay for each person."

2,LeDragon333,"I‚Äôm supposed to have a free trial so I‚Äôve started exploring the app and taking quizzes and it won‚Äôt give me my results unless I pay for a yearly or weekly subscription, so what is the point of the free trial if I can‚Äôt experience getting the results of what I‚Äôm doing so annoying!"

4,suezhobby,Just started the program. So far it can be difficult. I hope to see positive results.
1,macalex01,Can‚Äôt even try this without paying!  ****Update to developer response - obviously you haven‚Äôt tried to use your own app. Because what you stated is NOT accurate. It would not even allow me to continue free without selecting a PAID plan. It said I would have 3 Days free trial but I had to agree to a paid plan first!!    No Thanks!
5,Cadets82,I‚Äôve had multiple sessions and find the exercises very stimulating and fun to execute. Highly recommend for all levels of intelligence!
3,bugle6,The exercises for me seem either too simple or frustratingly difficult. Doesn‚Äôt seem to have a progression aimed at your own level.
1,alisha j f,The trial is called ‚ÄúUnlimited Pro Access‚Äù but the test results are locked behind a subscription paywall. I contacted support from their website and got no response. The trial is only 3 days long; I predict that by the time someone replies (if at all) my trial will already be over. Extremely frustrating.
5,ReneeDyer,"I love this already, I know this will help me with my memory and keeping my brain from declining as I get older."
5,Cbrn68,Without paying

2,Kindplanet12,Why even let me sit there and take the tests and quizzes and such when you‚Äôre gonna make me pay to see the results? Feels like I‚Äôm just wasting my time ü§∑ should tell me BEFORE I do the things that I‚Äôm not gonna be able to read it unless I pay 10 dollars smh

1,Thegowt999,I done the free trial and took a personality test all the way through just to get to the end and it was going to make me pay $5 to see what just took 10 mins out of my life to do. Yeah no don‚Äôt bother unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for something that isn‚Äôt based on fact anyway
5,Benojoke,It‚Äôs giving me an opportunity to focus on different ideas and patterns. I vary the tasks that I do daily by working with this app.

1,leooooo93,"I love this app which is why I purchased the pro version, but every time I go on the app it still asks me to upgrade to pro (even though I already did) and I have to click on ‚Äúrestore purchases‚Äù for it to work. This is the only app that does that and it happened every time I go on the app"
5,SafeWay2Be,"This game keeps you on your toes, some are easy and a breeze others need to focus (and wear glasses) to get better."

I then felt like the app wasn‚Äôt for me, and cancelled the free trial. I was then charged for a year subscription, after canceling my free trial. App policy says you can cancel a free trial within 24 hours, so far I‚Äôm not seeing that as truthful."
5,ABacheH,It‚Äôs a fun way to pass a little time while improving my brain function.
5,Matric Delayhey,"I‚Äôm on Day 2 of my journey with Impulse and at this early stage, I‚Äôm very excited about what is in store as I learn and grow."
1,Idontreviewunlessitsucks,I keep seeing the same robot generated response to each review. First ten minutes cool but the fake free trial then saying only some stuff is available like a free trial should be a free trial to everything. Unless I‚Äôm paying for everything why offer a free trial that ain‚Äôt free. I don‚Äôt care for excuses. I‚Äôm finna just unsubscribe. Definitely a waste of time!
5,Makibearr,this is pretty good for staying mentally able. definitely get it
5,Bronx N21,Challenge and improve memory!
1,Jo_112233,I just think it‚Äôs really messed up for them to let you take an entire 30 question test just to say at the end that you have to pay money to get your results. They know what they‚Äôre doing. I know it‚Äôs a common thing for apps/websites to do but it‚Äôs just kinda cruel in my opinion.
5,Cornfield18,Wow. I was taking the quiz and it felt like I was on Akinator describing me üò≠ It felt like it already knew it was just making sure. 10/10
4,onemeiam,Impulse brain training is a benefit to me since I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve gotten dulled in certain situations and things. These exercises are skill keepers and will help sharpen my attention and awareness.

5,timmifer,this is a really good app if you‚Äôre trying to become better at puzzles and just generally sharpen your mind and be able to critically think better. the only complaint i have about the app is that it has way too many ads. i think i‚Äôd be on it all day if it didn‚Äôt though
5,Treschicas,I really enjoy playing the game. I like the challenge and it does make you sharper.
5,Abdielcanete,I like to do these in the morning.  It helps wake up your mind and focus on the day‚Äôs activities.
1,Brytn3i,"I selected the option for the free trial in which it states that you‚Äôd get first 3 days FREE and after those 3 days you‚Äôll be charged the $6.99/weekly rate. Instantly, I received a notification from my bank saying that I‚Äôd been charged $3 by Apple and it was from this game. Deleted! You guys are falsely advertising. Do better"
4,DanJavRam,Love the games and the extra quizzes that allow me to get a picture of who I am. Only downfall is I wish it was formatted to work on a full iPad screen.

5,Bonesandcoffee,I really enjoy it. I would play it more than a few times a day.
1,Smith4621,Do not try out the 3 day free trial. You barely have enough time to try it out before you are automatically charged for a year. They have a 24 hour cancelation policy so it is completely mis-marketed. Should be a ‚Äú2 day free trial and then you get charged for a year!‚Äù  I would never have downloaded had I known.
5,Gigidiggity66,Challenges me each day to keep going and to increase my time and skill level!
5,Tony mugs,Without fail I somehow see positive results in my life when playing brain games.

5,Kezzyf,Super cool brain workouts that will benefit your memory and other brain exercises. I don‚Äôt have a subscription so I play for free and it‚Äôs fun!
1,r119ksl,"So, this application is just not for me. It seems to be super easy & not challenging enough, in my opinion. With that being said, I‚Äôve decided not to use it & uninstall the app; now, these fools won‚Äôt give me a refund! Try & make sure you get some satisfaction from the little trial they give you, or else!"
5,patti$credit,This has challenged me at a level I can tolerate and be proud that I score so high In certain levels

5,"Vegas, Alaska","Nothing wrong with keeping the mind sharpe with these kind of games, Highly recommend!!"
1,Jakegoox,"I signed up for the free three day trial, I cancel before it renews so I don‚Äôt accidentally pay for something I won‚Äôt use in case I don‚Äôt like it. I take a quiz and it tells me I still have to spend money to see the results of it, despite the trial being well‚Ä¶ a trial. It‚Äôs just another business with consumer unfriendly practices."
5,Viviquete,Really enjoyed the exercises! It is amazing to thing that I am real fun and improving my brain performance and capabilities. Highly recommend
4,Jkotzgolfer,I found this app very versatile. The feedback on cognitive level is lacking. What do the results mean? I wish there was more insight on status of results.
5,JessB129,"My kids and I like to play this. It helps with critical thinking, problem solving, memory, and much more!"
5,Slugga Lawless,Helps with cognitive problem solving and much more‚Ä¶I downloaded it for the IQ test and I‚Äôve been training ever since
2,Anonhgak,"Unless I just haven‚Äôt found it, the game they constantly use in their advertisements isn‚Äôt even in this game! The one where you need to connect the colored dots inside the circle. It‚Äôs why I downloaded it and now is why I will uninstall the app"

4,bboyles55,I really enjoy using this app and then seeing results. Would give a five star rating but some puzzles acted a bit quirky thus not giving a true score.
5,RishiSherlekar,"Love it, assume it will become more complex as I move to next levels, for my level of brain üòä"
5,hansenrj98,Overall a great app to spend a few minutes on daily! Only update I‚Äôm waiting for is a widget to display my streak
5,Mama VH,"Great for encouraging the‚Äùprocess‚Äù then ‚Äúdo‚Äù work of my brain.  I generally think in pattens, but his requires my brain to separate and process each element!!  Love it!"

5,WinterparkTanya,I‚Äôm in my 40s and trying to stay engaged with my brain. This is a nice way to do that.
5,KCNVA,I like the games. Not terribly difficult but require that I focus and maintain my attention. I can see how practice can improve ADHD traits.
5,LilyP911,It‚Äôs very good for brain exercise and it‚Äôs very well made. The only thing is I found it kind of expensive.
5,iiTzzKi3,It really keep you on your toes. I love the memory and adult math and I‚Äôm still training but so far I really love the app.

5,delite111,"Impulse is a great way to keep your mind sharp and relax, the ads are a little annoying but overall a great app."

Deleted the app a day later and they charged me $36 for a app with no jaw dropping features i have probelm with paying that much as long as its WORTH that much. I also read the guidelines it said nothing about a automatic charge after 24 hours.
5,ADHDShawn,"When it comes to taking care of your mental health, this is a method you should have in your routine!"
1,MossJ09,"Disappointed that there is no way to try before you link your payment information.  I would love to play a free or even trial version first to decide if I really want to pay a weekly, monthly or annual subscription fee.  So I deleted the app without trying it."

1,Egoore1,This app is a money grab by the developers. Even the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt include anything free - everything worth trying is hidden behind a paywall.   Hopefully the developers make the free trial more inclusive in the future - it‚Äôs not a very helpful tool to determine whether it would be worth it to shell out the money to unlock certain features.
5,Re@lLIZ,Best game you can get yourself!  Too busy having fun that you don‚Äôt even realize your learning.
5,cutie04142006,It‚Äôs very nice when my Brian needs a break from stuff and it‚Äôs helped me discover more about myself :)

5,Bbsb2023,I love this app. Can you please create more levels to the identical match games? This is my favorite game and love yo pass time playing it.
1,Gaby Damian,"This app opens on its own even when you are just watching a video on another device. I tried the free trial for barely 24 hours, and ended up canceling the free subscription even through Apple settings, and I am STILL being charged. This was downloaded back in August and deleted same day. Terrible app"
4,Foothugz,"I am loving the challenges of these games! Doing redundant work all day, it‚Äôs refreshing to bend my m d a bit to get recharged. Plus, these games let me know I‚Äôm not losing m touch!!"

4,"caples,jon","A while back, I suffered a stroke and I installed this app to get a feel for how my brain is working these days.    The software‚Äôs been revealing, helpful & at times quite frustrating.    I‚Äôm happy that I installed it; bittersweet as my experience has been, I have no intention of deleting it.    I‚Äôm just cranky about my performance & had to knock a star off bc the message it delivered was uncomfortable."

5,(1)(9)(8)(0),Just wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive to have the membership
4,Hello-_-Hi,It is ok really it really want you to pay and has a lot of adds if you don‚Äôt pay but if you do it is a yearly payment of 30 or more. Not worth it!
5,creativecreator4u!,it gives me so many game options to keep me on my toes! even my grade schoolers want to do it (secretly learning over Summer)!!!

5,mexboi21,I‚Äôve only had this app for a few days but it has already helped and improved my mental health
3,AnonGrown,Not paying for this app. Can do these things on my own on paper. Not impressed at all and every wonky not worth paying for. These seems like something ‚ö™Ô∏è shy-libz would pay for
5,RowdyRodzinak,Fun games while improving memory. Who could ask for more?
5,Gina Hendryx,I am completing my masters currently and using this app has given me a great opportunity to enhance my memory as well as a brain break.
3,Jemmah S.,"I like this game, but some of the things are too easy. I feel like the percentage at the end is wrong because there is no way I did one simple thing and outsmarted 99% of my peers. Are people really this dumb?????"
2,MEEPTHEGREAT,"This app contains multiple subscription fees and payments that are not advertised on the app store. The overall app would be decent if not for that. This app is truly completely useless. If you are struggling go see a mental health professional, don‚Äôt download an overpriced app."
5,godofthechessballs,"The games are actually fun, I have only had it for 2 days but if it continues to help me in my mental gain I will be very impressed"

There‚Äôs almost 0 chance that any of the tests any credibility.  It‚Äôs basically a casino for brain quizzes where they get to give you rewards and extract money

This test does not actually exist on the app. Also even if you get the free trial, you still have to pay to see actual results. I‚Äôm cancelling my subscription because of the false advertising though."
1,Hermiony56,You can take half these tests for free just on the internet with a quick google. This app required a subscription or to pay once to even get a test result AFTER TAKING THE TEST so you go through all that time just to be told you cant see the results unless you pay them.

5,Hannahjensen14,I live this game! The quizzes are fun and the mini games are even better! To avoid ads just put on ‚úàÔ∏è mode.
5,Anony321456,This game is more challenging than I expected. I can‚Äôt wait to see what it can do for me in the long run.
5,Dez Aparicio,"Honestly it helps me stabilize, concentrate and in a way reprogram things I thought I forgotten to did since high school   More calm and way less stress.  Love it"
5,1kosmoe,"My favorite app, hands down. Great for tuning my focus & retention levels. It‚Äôs helped to increase my overall mental clarity. Thanks!"
5,mike jordan jr,Provides an opportunity for users to be more efficient!
4,SilyB143,It keeps you well distracted and busy while having extreme anxiety about your surroundings and ends up being the highlight of your day.
5,Samantha montes,I haven't had this game long but it is fun and definitely feels like my brain is having a workout.
5,Neg-Pie,Great for getting you to think quick and keep your mind busy and learning
4,lk. err,Enjoying this app although I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs doing to my abilities to focus.   However it‚Äôs more than I was doing to improve.   So far- fun!
5,Gothkitty57,I am enjoying the way this brain workout has been designed to be fun!
5,GET THIS NOW!!,This app has enough variation to keep me interested and it‚Äôs helped me learn more about myself
1,brian.casey,"This app is not free, I downloaded it, and it asked me to start a free trial, I closed it out to not do so, and it locked me on the trial anyway. Now the only way to cancel without being charged is to contact their support team. They don't even list that on their scam of an app. Hopefully I can cancel on time, and I will report this to apple."
4,TLITTLE12,"It‚Äôs a great app, but there‚Äôs a couple minor changes that I‚Äôd make! For example; to help with accountability, I would recommend Push notifications!"
5,iknowaplace,"Games are so short which is convenient. Yet, They‚Äôre challenging enough to induce stress üëèüëè"
5,Robiz63,"Everything I‚Äôve played has been fun and challenging. Just wish it was free, but games this good are worth it!"
5,AbbyAnn M,"It is a great app for you to keep your brain sharp. The activities differ, but they are all important to the brain‚Äôs cognitive functioning"
4,Gabe Marciano's Apple Act.,"I recently had a traumatic brain injury and wanted to find an app to help me at home. This app is very similar to the exercises that I do in brain therapy. However, I feel the app is very expensive."
5,El_lusion1,"Okay, I am not a gamer, not at all! I tried impulse, and I truly enjoyed all of the 5 min I spent playing- challenging, learning experience made fun!"
5,Jeseph09876543210987554322,I enjoy this game. Covers a broad array of challenges to work you mind in ways you might not commonly.
5,flowzbed,I hope to see improvement soon! But it all seems like a game! Very good way to spend my free time!
5,34weeksprego,The games are actually quite fun and educational. I learned that I am not actually as mindful as I thought. üòú But I keep wanting to play.
4,Enormous Turnup,We all get bombarded with ads for apps. This one caught me and although there is a modest fee I will continue to use the game through the free trial and likely sign up for life.
5,Queen Yama,Why are the ads so long I just want to play the games . Other than adds this app is cool
5,hrjejd,Good and definitely helps working the brain simple but free version does have ads obviously.
2,Plumber bros,The games were good but you can't do a lot of what's advertised besides them. You can get your IQ score but you don't get to know what questions you got right or what ones you got wrong. It's nice but I personally wouldnt want to spend $30 (or more) a year on this app
5,Drekathegreat,"Love it in a world where I feel social media is dumbing us down , this makes me feel challenged!"
5,cjgarf,This game is easy but challenging at the same time. I would highly recommend!
5,da boyzz,This app helps me a lot and without even paying there‚Äôs like 0 adds and it helps me wind down
1,Shanellasaur,Every time I try to do the daily games it gets stuck on the arrow direction game. None of the arrows show up so I have to close the game out completely. I've tried deleting and redownloading the game and it still doesn't work. I searched for a help option but couldn't find any.
5,grjotb Gyno,"Other than Constantly being asked to pay for something, it‚Äôs super fun."
5,Dolphint4il,While it may be a just a game it has improved so much!! I highly recommend.
5,Bree0379,The games seem simple but they actually help you refocus. The tips it gives throughout the day are helpful.
5,Luxpurrii Fox,Fun when the challenges get harder. Time to use the old brain again.
5,lelaity,Super fun way to keep my brain active when I'm stuck with just my phone & nothing else to do
5,deutsche808,Really well designed application that I really enjoy using. It makes playing games seem productive.
5,RomanceL,This game will keep you sharp and on your toes. It‚Äôs different from other games I‚Äôve tried.
5,labdia1985,As a recovering amnesiac Impulse is a wonderful way to strengthen my brain to maintain access to pathways that took me 3+ years of recovery post-trauma. Very fun as well as therapeutic for relaxing before bedtime.
5,Jaffster323,Really works your brain and keeps you on your toes. Exciting trying to beat your old score

5,zxaida,Love to play this before work to Wale up my brain in the morning. And when I'm bored.
5,warnock wedding,This game lets me take a break from work or just stress in general. It‚Äôs fun and makes me laugh at myself when I get things wrong.
4,Calypso_007,So far liking this app as it makes me use things from back in school days which I believe should help keep my mind sharp and active.
5,BTX85,"Impulse has so many ways to help with cognitive reaction. It has tons of different activities may help with memory, math, etc!"
5,#hootyjudy,Fun and quick! Makes your brain think fast ! I enjoy playing this game every morning!!
5,LeoEatsBurritos,It‚Äôs a nice brain learning game where you can get better or learn more about your weaknesses or strengths. It‚Äôs fun to play. Highly recommend.
5,authorm61,I love the quick games to make you think quick!
5,Ava.Rozborski,"I love this game. It promotes a healthy brain, notifies you on when to practice and it makes it all in a fun way. It came up with fun games to play, whilst exercising your brain!!!"
1,pixibit*c,"I never even got to open the app because I‚Äôm not paying for anything that I don‚Äôt have an idea about. And when it says you have 4 day to pay for what you have used the app for no. It‚Äôs not even a week trial. It‚Äôs days. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a great app. I just can‚Äôt afford to throw money at it. But if you can, let me know how it works outz"
5,kdn25,Games hold your focus attention for just the right amount of time.
5,laytonslola,Best app out there. Games are incredibly fun and challenging lots of variety. You‚Äôll never get bored. So much fun and I‚Äôm helping my brain too.
5,allaboutci,I really emojis this app the games on fun and interesting n I think it‚Äôs really helping me with keeping my mind sharp and helping my memory.
5,audcarlson,We‚Äôll see if these get more difficult though!
4,Just A Girl In The World_86,"It‚Äôs fun and useful. Could do without the ads, but that‚Äôs comes with the territory of ‚Äúfree‚Äù versions. At least they make it easy to skip them. Overall, I like the app."
5,19angelbby94,Me and my boyfriend play this together we love this game would recommend to anyone trying to keep there brain sharp!
5,just ur normal joe,"So far I really enjoy it, I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family memeber"
4,8l0ck,I like it because it‚Äôs helping my improve mentally and it gives me tips on what to do after playing on how to improve.
5,TruIceQueen,I‚Äôm not fond of the patterns it‚Äôs almost like being overstimulated when it‚Äôs too much detail.
5,nicknameistaken22229,Good game but you could only advance so much until you have to pay to continue
5,Stildabiz,"I found this app to be really helpful, it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs keep your mind ready and alert."
5,Lukeh285,I can feel my brain growing the more I play the games! I love it and I can have my kids do it as well!
5,central-cal559,When you are home with covid you need some type of brain exercise or distraction and this was the one for me
4,Mar Mar panda,Love the game it‚Äôs wonderful you can choose how many activities you want to accomplish per day but even if you finish you can still do more ü•∞
5,Deedee91828,"This app is amazing, I love that I‚Äôm working on skills and just just wasting time on my phone."
2,uhlyssuhhhh,"The games are fun and some can be challenging, however you need to pay for full access to all the games. Either $40 for a life time or $6.99 per WEEK. You can start a 3 day free trial however you need to cancel it at least 24hours before the end of the trial. So it‚Äôs essentially a 48 hour trial."
1,sarahb 123,"This app is all right for one day but it is a total scam. It says when you sign up that you can cancel anytime, but there is no cancellation feature in the settings and no contact information (or at least they do not respond to the one support email in the terms of service). You don‚Äôt need this app."
3,Keefer Reviews,"I downloaded for the metal stacking game and couldn‚Äôt find it and there wasn‚Äôt much games like it this is a little pricey also, but I was able to cancel the subscription really easy in the Apple Store setting"
5,Igc2020,What an incredible game that stimulates your brain!
5,Godstrongpatty,"At 65 and someone who has used cannabis since the 1970a, keeping my brain sharp is important."
5,Host19,Look forward to solve it every day after work!
1,Still searching75,"Tried a free trial but it kept asking me to join consistently. If I had to the chance to post my photo of the ‚Äúunanswerable‚Äù, or maybe I should say ‚Äúmultiple choice option that was never going to be right‚Äù question I would. I will say math is my thing‚Ä¶ and if you can‚Äôt get that right then goodbye"
5,Buddy20127,"Love this app, its been a great help to my focus and organization skills. I look forward to all it has to offer üòÉ"
3,mready,This game is almost unplayable because there are so many ads.  I get wanting people to pay for the ad-free version but this is ridiculous.  Literally an ad every 15 seconds.
1,Redrose Theoneandonly,I deleted this because they lock all of the quiz results behind a paywall and don‚Äôt tell you that you have to do pay until after you waste your time.  You can easily find free quizzes like the ones on this app via a simple google search.
5,Imurvenus79,I believe i have adhd and this app keeps me entertained and i actually await for the the next day to play again
5,IQU2B^,Getting older can be a challenge! This game is what I need to build my self confidence.
5,The Nightstar,Reading in comprehension
5,D for Debi O,I‚Äôm new to this fabulous training program. Today is my second day and I feel more confident and blessed that I can learn.
5,Luckydagda,Started 3 days ago and it is getting harder. Feels like you are exercising your brain.
5,K-9charlee,It does not give you enough time to answer questions
1,Fyenamuzik,"I downloaded it first because the ad looked like perfect brain storming game and psychological tests with choosing pictures and drawings (as it was advertised) and I even purchased some extra thing to do the tests.. but none of the choosing drawings or anything you saw on the app ad are there, honestly feels like a scam."
5,No one!no where!,Try it
5,Patchen1234,Ease of use. Forces you to focus while not being to distracted from other tasks.
5,Hayley&Gage,This app really helps keep my mind sharp healthy by doing the exorcises and having fun at the same time! Im addicted üòÇ
4,Brain trait,Is a very nice and fun game. I like all the different choices and also that it doesn‚Äôt feel like a learning game just a regular game that you would play .
5,ripe I don‚Äôt,"I recommend this game because it can change your IQ in a day. This game has daily exercises, fun games, and tests galore. Please get the game impulse now."
5,littlelytes,Nice little reset to keep your brain sharp from scrolling/working
5,mskarma305,I‚Äôm beyond obsessed with this app. Very helpful and helping me get back on track ! Thank you impulse
5,katieKat2010,So far I am enjoying the challenges of this game and training my brain to work smarter not harder
4,I would try this,I didn‚Äôt work that good but I could for sure feel a bit smarter but just a bit!!!!!
5,Amanda Osborne-Zuniga,Only had two days but seems to know what it is talking about
1,Dartfrog designs,This app has trouble loading levels and sometimes will not load them at all.   Very frustrating and disappointing for an app you pay for when there are free apps available that load levels without issues.
5,Madgamer3604,Great games and levels for brain training. Keeps you sharp and always thinking!
1,William Goains,"I liked this app a lot up until a few updates ago. I enjoyed the candy sorting game but it has stopped working. It either will not load the puzzle to solve or if it does load it will not let you finish, it freezes up."
5,CarrieLee8,I look forward to the daily challenges and finally found a beneficial app to enjoy
1,jonas1234524,I never write reviews. This app is so bad. It could be great but the greedy developer completely overloaded it with ads that are broken and don‚Äôt even let you skip. You maybe use the app for 10 seconds before it forces you to watch a 45 second ad. Complete trash.
5,Stormynight16,Playing the games have really helped with my BRAIN FOG! Some games are harder but I feel like it‚Äôs been worth it.
5,jessirae78,"I like it, I wish it didn‚Äôt cost.  I may subscribe when I am better financially, I did enjoy the 3 days."
4,Tess$11,It is a great game. I got it to keep my brain fresh over the summer and so far it is working great. They do have a add between each game but they are short. Great app!!
5,bobreeve56,"This app is great, it helps me stay organized and boots my learning memory and ability with its gradual progression of challenges."
1,davc1979,"Games are dumb, I thought it would help with certain things to help me focus, but they took my money, I thought I was in a 3 day trial and got tricked into a discounted year. Anyhow took my money now I have a dumb app I don‚Äôt need.. false advertising on instagram.  Zero stars. Customer service??? Maybe upgraded stars. ill update"
5,Happilywed05,"Not very many days in, but I look forward to training each day."

5,EmeraldEyez703011,Love the variety and the various different tests. The reports are also very interesting and insightful. Definitely recommend.
2,christian0859,I gave it a 2 star because I spent 2 hours on it just to not see my results because I had to pay to see that‚Äôs. Thats redicoulous. I think they should make at least 1 test you take free and not make you pay to see the results.
5,Saperkins,I love to play puzzle type games on my phone and these are fun and help my brain health. It is a win win!
4,HarryBulzognya,"Good to kill time, especially if your adhd, and its nice to see where you stand amongst others. Not sure if I will pay past the free trial yet"
5,Cjb-160,I like to use the app while I‚Äôm walking my dog. It helps me feel productive and also adds a little excitement in the form of micro-doses dopamine spikes.

5,Django‚Äôs Mom,"Terrific games geared to improving oneself. Doesn‚Äôt get any better than this! Love the games, the app is a breeze. Highly recommend!"
1,Augameister,"If you offer a free trial but don‚Äôt unlock the features to try out, then it really isn‚Äôt a free trial. I played the daily games (free) & then spent the time to test for Archetype. However, they don‚Äôt tell you until the end of the test that you can only get it if you give up your free trial & become a paid member."
4,Yeah gorl,I gave it a four star because the adds are like all the same but I love it so much  Also I hope you can make more games!!
1,Iopip,The app lets you spent time taking tests and doesn‚Äôt make it clear what is included in your  membership and then prompts you to sign up for another tier to unlock the results of a test you just spent ten minutes. The app is filled with text book dark patterns. The developers should be ashamed.
1,Joshjosh1337,"Joke of an app for advertising being a brain development, attention and focus app. Trashy spam ads constantly pop up. Most require 15 seconds to bypass, advocating gambling‚Ä¶ 15 seconds of doing a challenge another one pops up. The 5 star reviews have to be boosted. Don‚Äôt bother with this trash."
5,Cartagena07,"I‚Äôm really enjoying it, lots of fun and lots to do"
3,Lenora Fletch R.,We are not given enough time to complete exercises. It should start with something reasonable and then the time can decrease as you get closer to 100%. This current process takes away the fun.
3,AliceLPSü¶Ñ,I intensely dislike the way these programs ask Me to Praise their work product after ‚Äúusing the program‚Äù for 3.5 seconds ‚Ä¶ oh gee .. isnt our App the best thing ever ‚Ä¶ TELL the World.   With all that said and after denying a half dozen times or more my opportunity to praise the programmers and everyone else who had contributed to this App.  Here it is.  Seems worthwhile .. i would bless your endeavors to improve possibly your brain functions by using this App.
5,karmadhyana,"This app feels like fun and games, but it provides a glimpse into a variety of different traits and talents of the user by offering test, games, and quizzes. 5/5"
5,Thaddeus Karmichael,"I like it. It‚Äôs cool, easy to work into your day to day schedule. Offers some insight on the mind too that I had not previously considered"
5,marticabonita89,I want to spend my time productively. Using this app has helped me sharpen my skills while having fun.
3,GRHHCGU,I downloaded the app to relax and enjoy the puzzles and games. But instead I‚Äôm more frustrated by the amount of ads that pop up after EVERY round.
5,MF681,I totally love this game!!  The only problem is if you get a new phone it does not port over so I lost all of my progress.
5,Frankiebull,This app helps me better understand my brain through fun and interactive games!
5,ging lambert,I have just started and within the first game I realized the value this will bring to my overhaul brain health.
5,staticsnap,"These are user friendly, well explained, and don‚Äôt take much time. Fun, too!"
5,/G\Lock18,I even purchased it for family!  Wide variety of challenges.
2,dustinmyglass,"Before my trial expires, I run into two puzzles with wrong answers. The correct answer to 8+2+7 should be 17 not 23. Another puzzle claims 5+6+3=23. And another claims 6+4+10=34. I think the developer needs some brain training first before writing brain training app."
5,kk.c.,I really enjoyed the game. It‚Äôs fine teaches you keep you alert. Opens up your mind and gives u scores !!
5,Batman1149,Just started this but it seems to be great! Definitely enjoying it
5,RF runs,As a person who does not believe in app games this is a good one and captivating but also challenging at best. Stay tune for more as my journey begins‚Ä¶..  -R
5,RelaxingTime!,"I‚Äôve played other brain apps. Impulse beats them all. Variety, levels, speed. I know my brain likes playing!"
5,Kyd A,The games give you space to improve and it helps with memory.

5,Loveityeah,Has really helped a lot and my brain don‚Äôt feel so mushy if that makes sense.

5,Fkdgbzfbsjtjfhfbxbfhxbdzhdbfnd,At first I just wanted to sharpen my brain but now I‚Äôm finding myself constantly using the app cuz the games are just fun
3,Hyperzombia,"You spend time aking a test, wait for the results to be calculated, and then it says you have to pay a not-small amount to see them. This alone ruins any positive impressions I had for the app."
5,Crazyal89,The main reason I like this game I get to move fast an see how many I can get right in the time. It‚Äôs a lot of fun!!
5,BrightSmileHappyLife,"Interesting Application with a new approach to games to improve your focus, memory and cognitive performance."

3,lauriluwho,"It‚Äôs fun and I think could be a Great help in the long run. I could easily do this each day! HOWEVER, it‚Äôs a lil dishonest because I believed it was free until I signed up then suddenly BOOM cost. It‚Äôs not a ton except I have no money to spare. Very disappointed."

3,Briannnnmmmm,It‚Äôs a cool looking app if you buy it but the adds are insanely annoying if you just want to test it out. You guys would sell more product if you cut that crap out. And what‚Äôs up with the annual fee? what ever happened to buying something to own it?
5,Super bob the boi wonder,I feel like my head is always cloudy but ever since I started using impulse Iam more focused and more attentive
1,Domo the homo,There is no option to cancel in settings in the app. They purposely make it hard to cancel by not providing any cancelation instructions anywhere. I emailed support one day after I downloaded and never heard back from them. It was only after reading another review that I found out how to cancel. Biggest waste of money.
1,Lizzles Magee,"I downloaded this app for less than a day and then deleted it. It charged me three weeks for the weekly subscription. I am very angry and feel scammed as I never opted into a subscription, I only downloaded the app. I would love a refund for the $30 out of my tiny college paycheck that was wasted on an undownloaded app. This company is ridiculous and I am beyond upset. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE MONEY!!!!"

Trial means you can test the app and cancel If you don‚Äôt want to continue use it during the trial version. Which I realized that I don‚Äôt need this app and I immediately cancelled the subscription. However, they denied to refund which is nonsense."
1,Hot southern mess,I paid for a yearly subscription. Just found out today they‚Äôve been charging me seven dollars a week for a year!

Nor are there options to do so within the app. I had to write to Apple for a refund!  *edit after developer response*  Developer, read carefully: YOUR APP DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THE SUBSCRIPTIONS SECTION (or vlanywhere in the link you posted) SO I LITERALLY AM UNABLE TO UNSUBSCRIBE. THIS IS YOUR RESPONSILITY."

2,TGav27,"I was enjoying this game for a while until they became greedy and started having too many ads!  One after every single stage of the game.  Geeze people!!!   LOOK, the ADS lasted longer than that stage or game!!!  That's when it's terrible."
5,Jaybeats3,"I love this app, keeps me entertained but not just wasting time but using that time to keep your mind sharp"
5,Emankik,Super fun way to challenge and exercise your mind and in variety! 5 stars hands down
4,KelseyC09,It‚Äôs a cute little app. But for almost 30$ a month I expect more than just quizzes.
4,Mazzy$$$,"I LOVE the puzzles so far, but you start off a little to easy. I think a test to put you at your level of puzzles could be really good"
4,Lemxnade.,Great for just listening to stuff the games are great but there are a lot of adds only downside

5,jennclark68,This has definitely kept my mind occupied. My brain is getting the much needed exercise.
2,RobbedByDeveloper,"I started with a 3-day free trial. During one of the games I ‚Äúwon‚Äù 92% off a yearly cost, so I was getting the app for $8. For starters, the math doesn‚Äôt work out since the yearly cost is $30, and secondly, my card was immediately charged for $30 so the 3-day ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù was also a lie. Very shady. Be warned."
2,Amaaaaann,"Some of the brain games are fun while others are way too easy.  Annoyingly, there are 1-3 ads between every couple of games (games that go quickly) unless you pay. Classic issue with apps, but this one is on the bad side.  And now the reason I‚Äôm deleting the app: took 7 minutes to answer 84 questions on a personality test, and then it said I needed to pay to see the results. TELL ME THAT BEFORE I WASTE MY TIME!!  Bogus money grab app but hey if you want to pay it‚Äôs probably fun."
1,YouMacaroni,"I thought a had a 3 day trial with out ads, ads are horrible and make the whole experience unbearable, I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying, as I appreciate the hard work devs put into apps, but having to wait through ad after ad in the trial period‚Ä¶‚Ä¶fack it‚Ä¶. No thanks"

5,I üòò it,I enjoy these games a lot more than normal iPhone games because I feel like I‚Äôm helping my brain ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,IslandWave,"I support developers and have no problem paying a reasonable amount for an app but this app is ridiculous with the horrible long ads. I would have been happy to pay for this app if it weren‚Äôt full of ads. If I were an advertiser, I‚Äôd be angry at apps like this who load their app with ads."
5,alibabba1288,This game is so much more than a mindless game to pass time. It has helped me keep my mind more active and keeps me sharper.

2,Marcusjwells,There are bugs in several games that ruin the experience. The daily training is minimal so don‚Äôt spend your money on this. There are much better apps available.
1,drfkjhkytvkjhghuylhbhg,"Hi, this is a great app and I‚Äôm thinking of getting the subscription but I realized that they give developer responses to the 1 star ratings so that what I‚Äôm doing, anyways I wanted to know if for any reason I have to delete the app or can‚Äôt pay for the subscription any more , will you let me cancel it?"

1,DirtSanchez,"Free trial actually doesn‚Äôt allow full access at all. It‚Äôs all locked behind a paywall. Took the IQ test, scored 115 in my sleep, can‚Äôt access the results without paying. What was included in the free trial? 3 days of limited access with a promise to bill my card at the end of the 48 hrs. 48 ‚â† 72, and no full app access. Hard pass."

5,A.DuBYA80,I love impulse. It keeps you on point and attentive. I didn‚Äôt realize how stupid I was getting until I started the app.
1,rivox1,"The free version is pretty much nonstop ads.   The games were ok, but waiting 30+ seconds after every game for the next one is just an exaggeration.  It‚Äôs understandable that as a business you need to make revenue, but if you shift your focus from trying to squeeze every dollar you can to actually showing the value by delivering a more seamless and immersive experience, I guarantee your paid subscribers will skyrocket.  Whoever is managing your monetization strategy urgently needs training in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics."
5,hdmdbdhhsmsbdjsm,It is so fun and intertwining and I feel smarter each time I play. I would recommend it!

1,UnhappyMinion1323,ALL of the tests shown in the advertising are locked behind a paywall and they don‚Äôt even have the decency to tell you that outright. You answer 75 questions and then find out you have to pay $7 per WEEK to get the results. Don‚Äôt waste your time or energy on this pathetic money grabbing scheme.
5,Epanne0614,Easy and user friendly. Good brain food. Recommend‚ú®
5,Burnindownthehouze,I‚Äôm trying to stay away from social media so what a fun reason to be on my phone
1,1457074468)2899,"Free app. It actually cost $7 A WEEk to play. It is beyond stupid that you think your game is good enough to cost money. Each and every game you have, is not your own. I could go download each game individually.  How are you going to charge for something you didn‚Äôt create? Cheater and a scammer."

1,thewallypug,"I signed up for a free trial but was charged for a  year when I checked a couple days later.  Sellers are not responding to my pleas for my money back. I will try again. I don't  enjoy most of the ""games""  many are too simple ( I learned arithmetic in Miss Butler's 2nd grade). That would be okay if you could choose to skip some and go to a advanced level. I 've wondered if some of the exercises are timed; it's a possibility, but that is never mentioned. Maybe this app would be good for those people diagnosed with evolving dementia. I'm too impatient for it."
5,FaithFishFry,"I like this game. It‚Äôs fun, helps you work out problems & think"
5,Dehcookiemonster,"I love the quizzes, the games, and how the app keeps track of your progress! For $30 a year its worth it"

5,VictoriaEJ92,Thank you so much for this game I absolutely love it and can see an improvement

5,luvmeli88,I love this app it has a lot of brain game strategies that help with memory I suggest you download its full of fun games and exercises
5,Lawonderful,This stimulates your mind. Don‚Äôt let the machine beat you practice makes perfect and steady wins the race against your mind
1,DeanOsCustoms,"I feel compelled to rate this game as it is false advertising on two fronts. It is not free, but costs a $7/week subscription to even try the 3 day trial. It is also rated (at the time) number 1 in health and fitness. Maybe educational‚Ä¶but even if this solved all the mental problems in the world, doesn‚Äôt deserve to be number 1 in health and FITNESS."
1,Tgrmag,"I got this app as it‚Äôs FB add claimed it had tests to help you with ADHD. Loading it all I see are generic brain training tests, and even more generic personality quests from click bait sites.  To add salt to the wound you can‚Äôt even see the results of anything unless you pay $5+ per test, or buy a subscription"
5,katmbvf,I love that there are so many different types of games and puzzles.
5,f4ding,Could be more fun with less ads. They're really intrusive
2,alj6705,"It is clear that whomever is writing copy for this app is not a native English speaker (or it‚Äôs just AI). While that normally wouldn‚Äôt be a dealbreaker for me, it‚Äôs disappointing to take the tests and get results that really make no sense due to poor translation."
5,floridachica222,Love this!!!! Can do this anytime but then I have a hard time putting it away :)
4,JulianaJones95,"I love the app but I‚Äôve already a u scribed and paid, there should be a way to recognize that and turn off subsequent ads unless I unsubscribe."

It is a WEEKLY subscription. I received an email with payment confirmation from Apple and requested immediate refund. Proceed with caution ‚ö†Ô∏è"

5,JT763B3,Great memory game. Gambling advertisements get in the way. Definitely not healthy if you are trying to work the brain. Gambling creates addiction.

5,gnell817,"I‚Äôve only had this for 2 days, but so far it has been a lot of fun!"
1,1516483920975241718,"Hate the games like these that I end up downloading from an add. The add version of the game always looks interesting, then when you go to download it‚Äôs completely different unless you pay for a membership. Just ridiculous. Deleting it almost as fast as I downloaded it."
2,N8T@L!3,"Almost downloaded after seeing Facebook ads. Realized, after reading reviews, that I had it before and the subscription cgarges are ridiculous. Sad because it seems like a great app but overcharging isn't fun."
1,hshshhdhs,When you first download it you get super easy puzzles which only take about 1 second to complete but in the free version you have to watch two 30 second ads before you can play a level. In about 10 mins I actually played the game for about 3 mins and spent 7 mins on ads
1,pochaccu,"I was so excited to use this app! But it crashes during start up every single time I try to open it. I‚Äôve tried clearing more space on my phone and turning it off/on several times but nothing made a difference. Might be a bug, hope it is because I still really wanna use this app. (iPhone 8 if it matters)"
5,Chill94*,It‚Äôs creative and useful. With everyday distractions and shots to our mental. This is something to fight back. Thanks Impulse.
1,KittenMO,I would never have agreed to a trial period which would turn into an automatic auto bill of $6.99 per WEEK! And yet they have been slowly bleeding me for 3 months! I‚Äôve requested a refund from Apple for the last several weeks and will pursue the rest with my cc issuer.

4,gonzomacks,i really loved this app when i first started using it. then i realized that the things i enjoy the most are limited. not because i am using the free version ‚Äî i paid for the lifetime version ‚Äî but because there have never been additional games and puzzles added. why? great app in general but would love some new content.
5,mya 902jhkw2,They just asked me a couple questions  And I got stared I‚Äôm 11 years old but I play as a 13-17 year old and it‚Äôs relieved a ton of my anxiety and stress THE BEST LEARNING GAME EVER üòùü´°üëçüèºüëèüôå

4,Pfvmg,Perfect for a 38 year old like me lol that just wants a stress free game to keep the mind sharp. Lots of things to choose from game wise and even has a IQ test too.
1,tamtbell,This is comprised of the most confusing puzzles or games. Most of them are hard to figure out just what they want you to do and there is no where to go to request assistance. Save your money. Don‚Äôt buy this. I‚Äôm regretting I did spend mine
5,"J,key","Definitely better than staring at a screen, trying to get birds to collect coins"

5,Jimaids,Just getting started with it and so far it‚Äôs been worth it.
5,Djmiss99,This is so fun. Five minutes a day. I‚Äôve only done it for two days so we shall see if I improve.
2,bambidybambam,Without a subscription this app is a waste of space in your phone. The subscription is more money annually than my investing app that actually makes me money so I would genuinely never invest in this as it‚Äôs unreasonably priced‚Ä¶$1 a day is insane.

1,LurcottTX,This app is terrible. Puzzles are nothing like the Insta adds.   I feel sorry for anyone that pays for this or pays money for in game upgrades.   It is worthless garbage like all the puzzle apps I have tried so far. If you can‚Äôt solve them all you have bigger issues in life to figure out.

5,NYTori,"So far so good, increasing difficulty makes the app challenging and interesting"
1,edcgbhuqasw,You can take a handful of tests for free but results are all blocked by a pay wall. You are able to see the title of what you are but not the full results‚Ä¶ it is a great waste of 20 minutes if you want to download it I suppose.

4,gehahahsshawh,I love this app so far it‚Äôs helping a ton. Personally I wish it was a little less expensive but other than that great app.
1,Bookielfc,Ads in between every level of a game is ridiculous. Especially when it‚Äôs the one you advertise.  The initial intro is also too quick to try and get you to pay - and throw the FOMO premium discounts at you.   No problem with ads in general‚Ä¶understand the need and the freemium model‚Ä¶ but all of this was overdone to the point where the whole ‚Äúgood for your mental health‚Äù pitch is nothing more than a money grab.  Could have been a good app. Quickly became all about the money. Quickly deleted from my phone.
5,Nickblurry,This app helps me unwind and stimulates my mind to allow me to focus

1,Jimmie99ma,"You can‚Äôt even try the game out before your hit with ads. It would be nice if there was a grace period like most games, before being bombarded with ads. Also they want you to buy the game before you test it out. Ever heard of try it before you buy it."
1,Oneandonly12321,I never write reviews on apps but this was just ridiculous. Navigating through the app is next to impossible without triggering an ad.

Will be reporting"

1,GadgetL4dy,"If you decide to cancel the app before the trial, good luck.  This app is not listed in the Apple subscription list like every other app subscription I have.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to cancel.  I have written the Apple App Store and my Apple Card and I‚Äôm waiting to see if they will reimburse me."
4,Eugris Grullon Pichardo,Explications are short and straightforward. Games are fun to play. I like so far the overall feature it provides.
5,Ruth Davis 75,"This is only my 2nd day, but so far the games have been mind stimulating and yet enjoyable !!"

1,lefty_091,"When first starting the app, it requires to start payment after the free trial (you can‚Äôt elect to skip the trial and only see what‚Äôs free.   Even after selecting the weekly option with free trial, I wasn‚Äôt able to see the results of any of the tests they advertise on Facebook."
5,TANTANBanban,I think I might actually pay for the premium membership for lifetime.
4,zeldaü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©,I love this game it actually kinda helps me calm down and its fun. But the reason i gave it four stars is because of the ads. But otherwise its great!
1,Johns Island girl,To the people who control this app that I pay for every month and have enjoyed. How do you allow these f‚Äôd up ads to suddenly creep in every few seconds and doesn‚Äôt allow me to get rid of it. I have really loved this app that I use daily till now. So sad. Too bad.

3,Hunkalibra,love this game but pls do less adds it‚Äôs rlly annoying and takes down the overall experience of the app. i shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to enjoy an app
2,tgbsyo,Lack of update on puzzles and word searches so you can‚Äôt move onto the next level even if you wanted to.   I updated mine and my 188 day streak vanished even though I played yesterday. Now I‚Äôm back to 0.  This is a good work out for your brain but it doesn‚Äôt have everything you need to level up which is frustrating. How can I hit the 500 day streak when it keeps putting me back to 0 with every update?!  Not worth it.
1,Quetin,"As usual with free games, it desperately tries to sell you a subscription, then offers you an ad free version (also a subscription) and then hits you with trick click ads every other game. I say game, but it‚Äôs basically a simple task. Draw a line, tap the match tile, swallow your spit, great job! Here is another ad!"

1,Nick S 113,Why would I have to subscribe to play this game and pay money every month when there are games on the App Store that are free that are exactly like this. Also your adds are false advertisement and should be more detailed about how you have to pay to play.

1,Dk%dk,I saw minutes after downloading that it auto-subscribes after 2 days.  Tried to cancel.  The app itself doesn‚Äôt let you cancel-they blame Apple and point you to their process to cancel subscriptions.  However‚Ä¶  IT IS NOT IN MY LIST OF SUBSCRIPTIONS!  No means to cancel from Apple either.
5,SunnySummerSky,Great I feel my brain fine tuning itself.
3,Noel Richardson?,"This is an amazing game but it has too many ads, it‚Äôs really frustrating. If the maker of the game could take all or some of the ads out, I would love the game even more. Otherwise it‚Äôs a good game to make your brain ‚Äúworkout‚Äù."
1,Abinoodle,"Every time I start a game or training session, it gets partway through and then just restarts. It‚Äôll restart in the middle of a turn, right at the beginning, right at the end - there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason, it just resets. It‚Äôs so frustrating!   The games and exercises are interesting and would be enjoyable if I could actually play them."
5,Gunther th4ti,Great training in short periods of time. Perfect for those that are always on the go.
3,kattiu dziejarski,"I like the app, but every time an ad pops up, there are tests that are NOT in the app, like types of trauma, types of femininity, etc. There are only about 8 tests that measure types of intelligence, nothing more."

2,SparkBoltfire,"I took the ADHD test and It says I have to buy membership to see one result of one test, so I‚Äôm only assuming this only cares about money and subscriptions. You expect a 7-17 year old to magicly have money. (I mean yes a 16+ year old would have money)"
5,Giovanni Aguiar,"If you want to learn about yourself, this is a great tool to use to learn and improve your cognitive and behavioral therapy."

1,EoghainMac,"Don‚Äôt bother as you are forced to buy a subscription just to get the 3-day trial. I realize businesses need to make money, but if your product is good enough you‚Äôd allow for a free trial that doesn‚Äôt involve any obligation before asking for a subscription."

1,Winter 0921,You can‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt have the subscription to the app to access any results you need the subscription and it is a waste of your time if you thought that you would be able to learn more about yourself.
3,Anilew,This is not very challenging. Must the games snd puzzles are just a worthless way to pass time. I wish they had a few really hard puzzles.
2,Cheezor,"Game was fun, but the app was way to insistent that I sign up for premium or pay a ‚Äú1-time payment‚Äù to get my IQ report. I didn‚Äôt think there was anything in the free part that made it worth putting up with all that."

1,M.Shiflett,"I fell for the Instagram ad, and downloaded this app to try. You can‚Äôt try anything without constant pop ups blocking you from seeing your results unless you pay for a subscription . The free trail is truly a scam. Also, 6.99/week? Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1,haleyh12345678,This app upgrades you to the premium plan and then charges you $7/week without telling you. I seriously don‚Äôt remember purchasing anything and then saw it card has been charged $7/week for months for an app I haven‚Äôt even played.

5,lbckillaz562,These mini games are really enjoyable and not so difficult.

3,teric!23,"I really like Impulse and feel it‚Äôs a great tool for mental processing. The games are fun. The FB ad indicates there is ADHD testing, but that does not seem to be accurate. There‚Äôs no way to connect with the dev team to get help or try to locate it."

1,‚Ä¢(^_^)‚Ä¢,"You have to pay in order to get most of the app that people look for, and when you do tests such as the iq test you have to pay for the results afterwards and it doesn‚Äôt even mention that. This app is money hungry. I do not recommend, don‚Äôt get it."

1,chawee.w00f,I don‚Äôt think apps like this do much more than waste your money and time. If you think you‚Äôre dumb- make a smart decision and do something else. You can‚Äôt spend a few bucks a month and play with your phone to become smart.

1,Kakata826383,I took a 60 question quiz only to be told that I had to upgrade or pay to see the results even though I was on the free trail and I never got a warning before.  What the heck I just wasted my time. I‚Äôm doing the free trail to see if I even want to try it out.

1,Sika893,"Says the app is free. Then educates you that it takes 7 days for people to see results, but only offers you a 3-day trial or requests immediate payment for weekly/monthly/yearly/lifetime. How would I know if I think it is helping me or if I find it beneficial with only a 3-day trial? Stupid."

4,JayCeeEmm,"With all the apps and distractions it‚Äôs nice to open up something, hopefully, beneficial for the mind.  I can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs a bad thing‚Ä¶ any of the activities.  My mother had early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs and when she found out, Dr‚Äôs had sent home brain training games.  I like to think and hope proactivity can‚Äôt possibly hurt either.

2,Blessed king of longing,I have spare money for good services but if everything I do on the app is asking for $4.99 for a onetime report or 6.99 A WEEK for everything else I wouldn‚Äôt download unless you have an understanding of how much this stuff is gonna cost.

1,FeetPants,Thought this looked cool. Got to the screen that asked what subscription I wanted to pay for. I noped right out and deleted it. I don‚Äôt have a problem paying for games but that‚Äôs pretty ridiculous to charge that much on a weekly basis for a couple games.

5,MissBeeMe76,I like all the games so far. Including personalized reports
1,MnamesPAUL,This app tries to force you to sign up for things 3 seperate times before showing you anything. They advertise a picture association trauma test that the app absolutely does not have anything remotely like. Kind of a bad look that this is claiming to be acclaimed by Apple?

5,Flo-Dawgie,"Definitely worth it. Still available without paying, helps my brain. DOWNLOAD IMPULSE NOW"
1,NugiNugi,Ads ads and more ads. You can‚Äôt play a game without seeing ads unless you pay for it. How do they have such high ratings. If you select most recent reviews there‚Äôs like 30 1-stars in row. They must bought reviews early on the app life cycle.
2,bsantedge,I purchased the premium version however the app does not allow me full access. Very frustrating especially since the charge went through!
1,harrisbaby,Maybe if you didn‚Äôt charge for with stupid app and just used advertisement between levels you would make more money and get people actually downloading the app. This is the stupefy crap I‚Äôve seen. Who wants to pay for something they can only play 10 minutes a day.
1,yaozerrrr,They start charging you automatically after 3 days even if you only use the app 1 time. I was being charged for 3 weeks membership even though I‚Äôve literally gone on the app twice. They give you 0 notifications about when they‚Äôd start charging you.
5,Cint11,I love this app so much it‚Äôs fun and very educational.  Love the challenges and it‚Äôs stimulating my mental capacity.  Can‚Äôt stop using it !!

5,doph2021,This is a good brain training game and I like how there‚Äôs lots of tests you can take!
1,Cudwid,All this app did was ask me for money before I even knew what it was going to do. I signed up for the free 3 days but that was ridiculous they wanted money before any answers from the long questionier they were giving out‚Ä¶foolish I say‚Ä¶greedy
5,Alma üå∏üôà,this game is really entertaining and fun I play it all the time . Especially the candy sorting one. Definitely try it!!

1,Jlrutledge6823,I purchased this app through Facebook ad. The terms state to cancel by emailing if not purchased through Apple Store. I have emailed them 4 times and have yet to get support with cancelling. They are saying they can‚Äôt cancel it or not responding at all!! This seems like a SCAM!!
5,mustangDM,Great way to exercise your brain to keep your mind sharp.
5,Debbie Burr,It‚Äôs always fun to have a short fun challenge. That‚Äôs what Impulse offers.
1,Balkanijaa,"I began my free trial three days ago and subsequently canceled it to avoid any future charges. However, I noticed this morning that despite canceling the trial, I was still charged $6.99. Don‚Äôt start it if you don‚Äôt want to end up same way"
1,xcvbndjwitnlk,This app is the mental teaser game equivalent to the ‚Äúslide the shooting guy back and forth to unlock the next gate‚Äù ads you see all over.. it‚Äôs just a bait for people that forget to cancel subscriptions and is quite literally marketed to people with ADHD that are notoriously bad at remembering to canceling subscriptions‚Ä¶
5,Brain games89,"Seeming to keep my brain more on point, so far, and am only on day 2!"
1,Dianeebee,"This might be a good app, but I found it so deceptive the way it tried to pull me into a subscription that I deleted the app. I still don‚Äôt know if I accidentally signed up for a subscription, hoping I don‚Äôt get charged for something I‚Äôm not using."
4,brainbreaktime,"Great app, wish there was a more affordable option"

5,Becca M G T,It‚Äôs been a fun experience so far. Looking forward to learning and growing with this fun brain work app.
1,Lbug8899,You can do the tests if you do the free trial.  However you have to pay to see the results of the test.  Really confused how there‚Äôs even a free trial. Also this is very very loosely based psychology that isn‚Äôt even correct. The tests are highly inaccurate and obviously not a real psychological test.
5,Kris10bb3,"So far so good, a lot of the games keep my attention & that is not likely."
1,Fabiano_Carrera,"The app offered a fear and trauma quiz with 40 questions, which was very time-consuming. At the end, instead of displaying the results, it stated that I had to pay to see them. Why not inform users at the beginning, rather than wasting their time?"
1,184749291&&$,"This app is not designed to help. This app is designed to get you to subscribe to their service. Don‚Äôt bother trying the tests just to see how they go even if you‚Äôre curious about subscribing like I was, because you can‚Äôt even see the results without subscribing. Yikes."
5,Toofootforyou,"I love to challenge my brain. I absolutely love brain games, word and math puzzles too! Love this app"

1,MUSIACIALLY LOVER,"I totally forgot about signing up for a trial & had no plan to actually subscribe beyond the trial. Unfortunately, I forgot about it and by the time I noticed the recurring WEEKLY charge of $6.99, they‚Äôd already gotten $35 that I didn‚Äôt plan to spend!"
4,Travioli was taken,I‚Äôve had it for 2 days and I can already feel my brain growling with productivity.
5,Victorious Kelly,So far so good. I just started but it‚Äôs fun to play a game that is intended to keep my brain in top shape in my 40‚Äôs.
1,Grace B360,"I tired this app, but decided it was to expensive so I went to end my subscription. The app is not user friendly to cancel the subscription, very unethical to not include ‚Äòcancel subscription‚Äô within the app. I‚Äôve lost trust in this company."
5,Tbryant333,I think I enjoy it most because of the competitiveness lol
2,W-W19,After around level 50 don‚Äôt change in complexity after level 100 the puzzles just stop having answers all together.
5,tshatsoff,I enjoy this and know it is helping strengthen my memory skills.
3,Jerry_hr,"DONT PAY for this app - You will still have to watch ads   Had I known this , I wouldn‚Äôt have paid.  The games and puzzles are great , but I HATE WATCHING ADS even though I PAID"
1,JoyoftheWord,I purchased the lifetime version $49 because the app is great AND it is so annoying to get interrupted in the middle of a challenge every day with ads for other apps to download .   I want a way to shut off these other app promos/offers or a refund of $49.

5,TobyD86,It‚Äôs a good game to keep your brain in check. It is also good for memory skills and whatnot.
5,KrogerReese,It has help me awake out if the bed. Working my brain early in the morning is great.

There‚Äôs practically no ads, but it pops up after EVERY test, Buy Premium! Buy Premium!! Buy Premium!!!

If you tap the ‚Äúx‚Äù to close the window and not make a choice, a pop up titled ‚ÄúFree Version‚Äù shows up saying that the free version only gives you 3 games a day. Followed by 2 buttons: ‚ÄúStart free trial‚Äù in green background and white text in the top and  ‚ÄúContinue with free version‚Äù in grey text on a white background.   Subtle design manipulation designed to get as many weekly charges on your credit card as they can."

1,Olivia Atk,"The app is so not worth the price. You could for sure find a free app with brain games and the ‚Äútest,‚Äù are horrible. It‚Äôs like a poorly made buzzfeed quiz with so many typos I‚Äôm pretty sure it was all made via google translate. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
2,Dmtgy,Not just ads after every game but long ones. Too many more affordable games without ads to spend time with this one
5,fredmorris,One of the things I look forward to doing

5,Love Stage!!,I feel so energized with a clear head after this.
1,forest tamer,Don‚Äôt bother getting this app as it appears to be free on the App Store (intentional). It will draw you in and shove it‚Äôs monthly subscriptions down your throat until you end up deleting the app. It‚Äôs a total waste. Unless of course you want to spend money on this crap.
5,Gingersnap1932,Caution participants to make sure they understand instructions.   Don‚Äôt feel rushed.
5,KG69420,Could be more difficult. Maybe I keep Progressing?
5,Jhortonbrazil1992,"I really like this app, I definitely think it‚Äôs helping my exercise my Brian :)"
1,whatanivkname,The trial doesn‚Äôt allow to view tests results. The app offers ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù subscription with 92% click after every click. That 92% off is a regular price for yearly subscription. Manipulative ways to get the money from consumer.
5,mark's birth.,The best ever. I am so happy that I have found this.  I will have lots of fun with it.  Thank you impulse.

5,kiklabrox,"I enjoy the  brain games to help me  have a task to do, keeping my busy,  mind busy!"
3,Amerist,$6.99 a week feels like a money grab. A $6.99 one time purchase would be more reasonable. At least offer a lifetime option.
5,overitbuildabridge,Fun to see the speed my hands and mind stay in sync with age.
5,Shelby L Thompson,I just started using this app and I love how engaging and helpful it is. Thank you!

5,Caity Beth Cool,Very amusing to play different kinds of games. Really gets my brain going. Good job
1,Nicholas Pou,"The ad said ‚ÄúWhat color is your aura?‚Äù and you are taken to a brain game. I filled out the full profile and I did enjoy the first game, but I didn‚Äôt sign up for a memory game. I feel cheated by the ad as it doesn‚Äôt really fulfill what it is advertising, so I‚Äôm deleting the app."
5,RoniLyn81,My son and I love it and can play for hours‚ù§Ô∏è

5,Walbay,Keeping my brain active for memory
5,kay2cute4u,To many adds
5,Jordancp,This has to be the best app I‚Äôve downloaded in a long time
1,Dastimp,App has a paywall. You have to buy subscription and then sit through ads despite you paying for subscription. May as we‚Äôll just have stayed free to justify sitting through ads on a paid subscription
5,Crusher201,Keeps your mind going all the time!
1,target56,"7$ / week subscription? Just to play mind games you can play for free in other apps? Absolute rubbish. As a side note, there isn‚Äôt conclusive evidence these mental health apps even help with improving your mind. I was simply interested in brain teasers to help pass the time, not drain the bank account."
1,Big Jav 17,"Way too many ads. Like way way too many it‚Äôs not even funny. You have to focus pressing the skip and the X 5 times for each ad that I got more brain training from that than the games, ridiculous"
1,AnonymousSB93,Was intrigued by the ring stacking ad featured on Instagram and shown in the App Store screenshots. This problem isn‚Äôt available in the game. Completed a few simple problems and then immediately deleted the app once it started pestering me for money. Waste of time.
4,Lord Casper,"I think this app is great, but to buy it costs too much and the ads get on my nerves"
5,KristenBossChick,I just installed this game & I love it soo far; really stimulating my mind & it really gets you to think

5,theoceanismysanctuary,I‚Äôm recovering from a brain injury and this is a awesome therapy! The app is well designed. Not too overstimulating visually and the games are fun.
5,Statefarm234,I use this app daily. I think it‚Äôs great and it helps me to get my brain ready for the day

4,amarie2566,This app helps me focus which is so challenging and now I‚Äôm doing wayyy better in school! Very little ads and great deals!
2,mellasay,There are so many adds. Every time you finish doing one thing there's an add. You complete one thing ( Not a level. Only one thing.) and there's an add you have to wait to for. That's too much.
5,Kenzon.1,I like impulse app so much it‚Äôs more the fun then it leads on most definitely with an educational purpose obviously.

4,El Nort,"Feel like I‚Äôm sharpening my brain, but the ads add too much lag time between games."
5,Pv2 Rigby,Added this app to my daily routine
5,serge dog,If you like thinking games this is for you
3,FontGuy,"If you don‚Äôt pay for it, there are way to many ads. Great games and good for the brain but the ads make it not worth it."
3,little_dove27,"Finding the games to be engaging, just wish the app wasn‚Äôt so expensive; not worth the price, esp when you just can‚Äôt afford it or rationalize it."
5,Myriah06,It really makes me think
4,jzab leader,When I do any other work I feel like I can‚Äôt focus but this game here or app is helping me out.
1,Rereü•∞33,"They have you taking these long drawn out test & when you finally make it to the end to get your results, they want you to pay $25 for lower package or more for the higher package in order to get the results. Uninstalling"

5,Mjstore,It's resourceful when you want to encourage continuous motor functions of the brain.
5,bob13indi57,"To whom it may concern, I‚Äôm a really big trivia fan; and your game is very stimulating and well thought out. While I know you need income to push the limits try to keep the ads and commercials to a minimum as best as possible generate more of a crowd and sell your idea to a big tech company.  Best regards,  Robert Indiviglio"
4,Dimplesisaac,Impulse is simple and easy to understand. Also has a relatable meaning behind the strive to just completing the game successfully.
5,fh g fdr,It helps provide basic knowledge and improve my skills. Its a great app.
5,Dey-na,I got it yesterday for the very first time and I‚Äôm loving it so far! It‚Äôs great brain exercise and a great way to improve brain function.
5,Philmore24,It‚Äôs actually fun I like the games and help improve my reaction time to things
5,Buzzmeaster,I like what you provide !
1,Tblizzle24,"I was actually interested in this app, but the fact that I have to watch an ad or pay money just to play another level is RIDICULOUS. Understandable at a marketing POV, but as someone who enjoys playing games such as the ones in this app, it‚Äôs upsetting to see I‚Äôm limited to minimum fun. I will be uninstalling immediately."
1,ObieTric,I enjoyed the first day of uninterrupted use. I was waiting for the add part and then day two hit and it was add after add to play a game for two minutes I had to watch a 30 second add. Day 3 cuts you out almost completely.   Pay to play here folks. Not for me and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to any else either.
1,mehitsucks,The games themselves weren‚Äôt as engaging as advertised. I tried them out for a couple days and ended up accidentally paying for a week. This app is over priced for $7 a week and I can‚Äôt believe I wasted money on it. Also there‚Äôs no clear way to end subscription in the app.
5,bratbritnee,I enjoy this game a lot it really does help your brain
4,":,( ----","It‚Äôs a nice brain app. I love puzzles and such, so the games are super nice! I‚Äôd recommend this app to the people who want a fun, interactive, and‚Ä¶ well, brain teasing game!"
1,AliJoseph,"I downloaded the app and it first asks a bunch of questions, then appears to give no option but to sign up for a 3 day trial before automatically rolling into a $6.99 WEEKLY subscription fee and states you could cancel that in the App Store.  No thanks."
3,Fjcfjvtittfffffff,The game is fun but getting an ad every time I pass a level is frustrating
5,Luckyzen,Multiple brain training exercises to play. It‚Äôs fun and inviting to continue use.
5,üòóü•¥,I respect and appreciate you very much.
5,Hayliee03,get it so I can see if I‚Äôm smarter than you
5,gabbymecole,Thank you for making my mind think
4,sahabah,It‚Äôs straight forward and explains why the games are beneficial with simple words. The upscale is not too intrusive.
5,cbo219,Very impressive and it help to stretch your brain effortlessly!!!
5,Tbirda,Feels more like a game then the others.
5,Omheaven,Impulse rejuvenates the brain on a healing journey.  I recommend slowing down to heal and become aware step by step.

4,emomri,The relaxing game at the end is the best . I have to do it every night before bed.
1,Password89999,"I couldn‚Äôt even register without them asking for money. They offer a 3 day free trial and that‚Äôs a joke. Why can‚Äôt they make this stuff more accessible to all people, not just people with discretionary money."
5,Love Always Xo,"Simple 5 mins relaxed my nerves from the day, as I was a little restless from the day. I‚Äôm relaxed now."
4,ùí¶ùíæùìÅùìÅ ùìÅùíæùíª‚ÑØ,You are helping me think fast and be better mentally
1,Bonjody,"I was offered a 3-day free trial, but was immediately charged for a subscription.  If this company does that to everyone, that‚Äôs a lot of money collected without consent.  I canceled my subscription right away and am hoping I don‚Äôt keep getting charged."
5,Eirish8,Great fun! I‚Äôm learning so much about how I think and how to improve my memory.
5,SouthernThrill,Just downloaded yesterday but already hooked! Lots of fun and tests your brain daily!
5,juvonna,I don‚Äôt really like to learn about anything but this one was really good
5,Justicesgirl,Took a test to see if I had ADHD. I already knew I did. SEVERE  signs of ADHD ü§£ü§£ I‚Äôve never felt so offended by an app. The games are fun and entertaining.
5,Jess553377,This is my first time playing games to strengthen my brain. It‚Äôs not boring like I thought. It‚Äôs fun.
1,iceproncess0966,You can‚Äôt play a single game without signing up for a subscription. There‚Äôs a 3 day free trial but only if you agree to a payment plan first ‚Äî then cross your fingers that the cancel button won‚Äôt be hidden. Deleted.
1,StarrBryte,There is no way to cancel you subscription!! When you email them they either can‚Äôt be reached or they redirect you to something that won‚Äôt work!! I‚Äôm gonna have to cancel my card because of this!! üò°
1,mittromneyswife,"Games are super easy & only like 30 seconds, which is shorter than the ads (which are after every game). Dirty & scammy monetization. I know apps need to make $$ but this is not the way. Highly recommend Lumosity for brain training."

2,_empty_handed,"This app is well done and interesting. However, it will allow you take the long tests, only to hold your results hostage for an annual membership fee. Frankly, I‚Äôd prefer ads within the app, in lieu of the fee."
1,KCAcrew,Allows you to take an entire test just to tell you to pay to unlock the results. Huge waste of time they should have been up front about instead of sneaking it in at the end.
5,Belath,Really awesome app. The $50 lifetime subscription is such a great purchase. Needs more useful apps like these in the App Store.
5,MicMommy2,Very addicting and engaging way to train the brain. Love all the feedback it provides!
2,123987idkanymore,Doesn't allow you to play without wifi and there‚Äôs ads like every 2 levels and its driving me nuts. Good game but not worth the ads. Uninstalled.

3,J280Z,"I enjoy the math games, but it gives an ad after every single round. They need a better business model"
2,Gotten worse,"There‚Äôs an ad every other level of the games to the point that it ruins the app entirely. I get having ads, but that‚Äôs overkill. Deleted the app for that reason alone."
5,Sjane747,Great when your brain needs a break or you are struggling to focus on a task.
5,dex473,Keeps me focused while I‚Äôm using the app and takes away my scatter brain lol
5,Lainababe,I feel like it‚Äôs too easy. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm this what according to this app haha

5,MrsDreadlord,Great mix of training. Enjoying the challenge and the diversity. The tests give good insight into much of my tendencies.
5,2bullnc,It‚Äôs day 2 and the games are pretty good so far!
2,Andytrush,The games can be entertaining but the app is very annoying to use if you want the free version. Ads and prompts to upgrade to the paid version are constant.
5,Smbrpb82$,Love the games that get me to concentrate and actually relax as I go through the various tests. Glad I joined.
5,ChristineAT,I am loving this so much!! My husband share with me this app and I am so happy he did it.

5,Big Body 68,The games that they have on here are actually really fun and I enjoy them
1,Somo26,"This app shouldn‚Äôt promote it self as in-app purchases, it literally requires a paid subscription to use it. Just charge a fee off the bat and stop scamming people who won‚Äôt remember to turn off their subscription after the 3 day period is up.  Just play chess people"
5,Grace the Dancefloor,It‚Äôs a great app to take some time out the day to keep yourself focused and sharp.

1,A real person say,"Too many apps where you need to commit to a subscription just to try an app.  Might be useful, but will never know.  Yes there‚Äôs a free trial, but forget and you are stuck paying silly fees.  Apple you really need to change this model."
5,lindielove,It‚Äôs pretty cool! I just signed up and I already love the engaging games. Worth it to me.
5,Keys Bartender,Just started on 2nd day it is going well.
1,schillbj,This is not beneficial to the human mind. It‚Äôs just a distracting little widget to keep you from really learning more about yourself. Why is it really that difficult to just sit in silence with your own thoughts instead some game to keep you occupied?
5,MommaBof4Blessings,I absolutely love the variety of games and definitely can say I am addicted!!
5,Accept it,It‚Äôs a very great game love the fact that it has so many options

1,katiehaney78,I was drawn to the app from an ad on social media. I specifically wanted to take the test that was shown in the ad. I subscribed but then found that the test doesn‚Äôt even exist on the app. They have like 6 tests and a few brain games and that‚Äôs it.
5,JTGleas,I have another app for reading and math. I needed one for visuals and puzzles. This is a great one!

5,DMV Mo,Definitely a must try
3,ORIO11,This app seems good at first but its lacking content and flow.  Im not really sure what games i should do to improve my stats.   I would say improve the gamification of the app but make that based on scientific analysis that is sort of build in based on real research.   I get that these are brain games for specific areas of the brain but other apps have a more scientific and gamified approach.
5,andrusbella,Is a really good tool to keep up your brain working!
4,Moker T,This is great for someone who would rather do something stimulating than be on social media.
5,miss i ss i pi,It very good app. Game fun I like a lot. It got a lot of cool things to do never bored. I play a lot because it very fun :)

5,Take a risk and read it!,I just downloaded but I am really liking the app so far. I love apps that help my brain. Haha
1,nickname is alicia,Totally overpriced for a few short games a day. Also be prepared for a notification every 30 mins about ‚Äúrenew your subscription‚Äù or ‚Äúdo your brain training now‚Äù super annoying there‚Äôs a lot of other options.
1,Ria 1211,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever pay for a product that I can‚Äôt test without giving up my info or having to pay after 3 days ? You can keep the game and apple can keep hiding critical comments so user be weary!!
5,Komorebi.888,I love the games and challenges that come with them
5,Justaskmyheart,"I love this app, the games are very unique, creative, fun and work different parts of your brain."
5,slothvader10,Im terrible at math and wanted to improve and so far this game is helping tremendously. I am gaining more confidence with numbers.

5,Dayvia10,Impulse is a great way to exercise your mind and it pointed out areas of thinking that I take for granted daily.
3,CoJo515,"I like it and it is a refresher BUT with ads every single time you finish a course, it's annoying. The ads are long too. Will delete."
1,CRBPF,"App is mediocre at best. Then they make it is very difficult to figure out how to cancel the subscription, but you have to do it within 24-hours or you‚Äôll be charged anyway. Just seems like they‚Äôre trying to lull people in to steal a few quid. üëé"
1,lamalips,"Then this is the app for you!  I‚Äôm not new at this. I understand the ‚Äòpaid/premium vs. ad-supported free‚Äô business model. But no app that makes you watch this many ads, this frequently, is worth your time."
5,Tracimfcollins,"Lots of different mind games, lots of different tests"
3,Da_Rammm-bammm,I like this app. My only problem is that I had this game for one day and then all the good games that I actually liked got locked and it was asking me to pay for a free trial and now I‚Äôm not enjoying it as much. üòï
1,saMorsaL,1. The game they advertise is not available in the app  2. To use the app you must sign up for a payment plan and there is no way to cancel the subscription from within the app  I would give zero stars if that was an option!
5,mamma's play time,"It‚Äôs fun, challenging, but the ads are a little too long."
5,SuzieQue1972,It doesn‚Äôt feel like you training your brain. It‚Äôs a lot of fun!
5,dw. mike,I work a high stress job and use the app to re focus trough the day!.
2,this app is amazing ok,It is stupid that you have to pay to see results and on everything nothing is free besides some games.
1,Beered out,I thought it was going to be a good app away of informing you about your mental health/awareness etc.. just another nickel and dime app. You got pay for everything. Taking test than spend more to find out the results. This app stresses me out
5,anthony 123h,this is the best training app for  your brain this helped me out a lot
5,Trancefherence,It amazes me how their test really help me to know more about myself
5,CDB4714!,I am so hooked on this! At least it is helping my brain instead of wasting my time! LOVE!!!
3,dkheart2000,how the heck do I unsubscribe if it isn't in my apple subscriptions?  I don't want to get charged & keep getting charged for an app that I don't use because I forget it is there. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3,lee lee boogie,It‚Äôs good but unless you pay for the premium stuff you can‚Äôt use like half of the stuff and the ads are overwhelming

5,Faith Allday 1465,It‚Äôs a fun mind chasing game with no problem for continuing to increase to the next level.
1,Grandali44,I am disappointed with this app.  Many of the games performance is based on how quickly you can tap on your phone.  And the language games are very poor.  Will not be renewing my subscription.

1,Pagiel. I,What‚Äôs the point of paying for subscription if you‚Äôre going to have ads being played after a couple of few games
1,knmxoxo10,"BEWARE: this app will offer you a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù, but will immediately charge you upon opting in with no free trial period whatsoever.  I reached out to them for a refund and was told to contact Apple, then was told by Apple that it wasn‚Äôt eligible for a refund.  Really frustrating experience all around."

1,whois???,"There is no free three day trial.  It will waste your time, try to sell you a cheaper plan, and then you‚Äôll take a ‚Äútest‚Äù and it wont show you the results unless you subscribe.

It‚Äôs not in subscriptions to unsubscribe in app section or settings. I emailed a couple days ago and haven‚Äôt gotten a response from our team.
1,Someone who likes soccer,I deleted the app as soon as it said $7 a week. Again listed as a free game which it isn‚Äôt. I TRULY HATE false advertising. Zero stars. Seeing how many 1 stars I‚Äôm sure that the 4.6 stars this app has is because they are paying apple to have a high rating. Which I‚Äôm sure apple would ‚Äúdeny‚Äù.

5,l.dewitt,Fun interesting ways to train your brain!!
5,MarySophia420,"I am really enjoying expanding my mind and working on who I am as a whole individual. This app is both fun and definitely sharpens my mental fortitude. It also helps to show me where I am in my mental health. For example if I am playing the games and not living up to my own high standards and my internal talking is friendly, kind and supportive than I know I need to check myself and where I am at in how I treat myself. So in conclusion this app is 10/10 and I would recommend. I am going to be sending it to my 16 year old daughter and my 9 year old daughter. But full disclosure it‚Äôs only day 2 of uses. So I will keep you all posted on my thoughts. If you are reading this you are probably like me in a certain way and I think that is way cool. I wish you well in your journey towards self growth/ improvement. These are my honest thoughts. I wasn‚Äôt offered anything, nor do I have anything to gain in giving this app such a glowing review. I just enjoy calling them like I see them and giving positive feedback when I like something so that it can help others to enjoy it as well and when I hate something I give it very specific feedback on that as well lol some may call it scathing. Don‚Äôt cross me. I am a very kind person, but once disrespected I will tear you down. After I am done with this is have a dentist to review and my recommendation is not good at all haha. Anyway I am a wordsmith and I enjoy expressing myself so I can help others. I like to read reviews so I enjoy giving back to the reviewers community. Keep on keeping on folks. Be kind to yourself and through that kindness may you find the ability to be kind to others. My god/goddess bless you and keep you. Sending nothing but good vibes."
1,mnt157,"The games are mostly puzzles to pass time. They are limited in scope and there are no tips on how to actually improve performance in the games. If looking for brain training, look for something else."

1,Ashnic2006,"The only way to get rid of ads is to pay a monthly price or yearly subscription. And there is literally ad before you can even start the game, time you finish a round there is another ad."
1,jrand77,"I was using the free version and between games, there were annoying game ads that I couldn‚Äôt get rid of unless I closed the game and restarted. I deleted Impulse before finishing my first day. I don‚Äôt know if the brain training exercises were worth doing or not. It was annoying."
2,EC2889,The app asks you every minute to buy. Also the stats showing how you rank seem wrong. Completing tasks 100% show you're only in the 10th percentile.
1,TheBossMan105,"The app is fun, but do not download this app if you like paying for things voluntarily. The bills you find out you‚Äôve been getting on automatic renewal that you weren‚Äôt aware of aren‚Äôt worth trying the game out to see if it‚Äôs fun on the 3 day trial."

5,163!:??/!,Is a great app to train your brain I wish it was completely free
1,FreshStartDuck,"I signed up for the 7 day free trial, and was immediately billed.  When I tried to resolve it, I was told I had to request a refund through Apple.  Apple denied it.  This may be a great app, but this part was a scam and fraudulent in my opinion.  I‚Äôm not trusting them anymore."

1,WazeBlaze,"Signed up for the 3 day trial, did activity and app wants me to pay to see the results. So basically the 3 day trial does not give you full access and wasted my time which put a bad taste in my mouth about the app. I was interested in purchasing the lifetime plan but now won‚Äôt because of this false 3 Day Trial. That was your opportunity. You only get 1 opportunity to show off your goods and you failed and lost a sale.  QA Global Sales Mgr."

1,Betsy0704,"I paid for the yearly subscription and I‚Äôve still been getting charged weekly. Also, the ad that made me download this app showed a game that they don‚Äôt even have!"
1,xKibou,"I had downloaded this from an ad on Instagram, and a lot of the comments had said it was free. When I opened the app, it asked me to either do a 3 day trial and then pay SEVEN DOLLARS A WEEK? $7 a week is absolutely insane for a mobile app. I'm deleting this scam of an app immediately."

1,TE9260504,I was seeing this advertised all over tic tok and unfortunately made the mistake of paying for the whole year. The tests that they advertise are not on the app which is a super bummer. Waste of money.

1,Poor Walter,Deleted this immediately. Everything is behind a paywall and all these ‚Äúad‚Äù pages come up touting the greatness that can be unlocked by sending them one or more monthly fees. Money grabbers.

THAT PART SEEMED TO BE WAY TOO DRAGGED OUT!! INFINITY & BEYOND!! I ALMOST FELT ‚ÄúFORGOTTEN ABOUT‚Äù BECAUSE OF THE BONUSES EXTENDED & LENGTHY PROCESS!! BUT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶YEAH!!! IT FINALLY ENDED!!

5,Marielis1987,It takes away my anxiety.
5,Helloiamwatchingu,This app helped me before a test! (I got a 100%)

5,bhhghhfnjhfd,It‚Äôs very fun it allows me to train my brain at my own level.

5,yuyi1986,Thank you for creating this app
5,jayjayfelix,I actually have fun using this app! I think it‚Äôs amazing .
1,whumpis,Very typical ad business model or very pricey weekly subscription $7 per WEEK.     The login and start flow is confusing as to whether the app lets you play for free or if you are buying a recurring $7 weekly subscription.    The promotion strategy through Instagram is relentless.   I‚Äôm guessing there is high enough conversion and hooks into the ambiguous subscription model that this is a viable business.      So.  If all that sounds Unfun then don‚Äôt bother.
5,Badsunny_bleep,"This game is very fun, i like how there are diffrent tupe of games you could play!"

1,whatever just do it,I had the same issues as previously stated by others. There was no clear guidance on how to properly cancel the subscription AND it‚Äôs just not worth it. Some games are not challenging at all others make absolutely no sense.

4,Arxantia,"I like all the challenges and as math isn‚Äôt really my strong point it does seem to help a little. The two downsides to me actually involve the same thing. It has this ‚Äòyou did better then x% of your peers‚Äô message that pops up after EVERY game. Idc if I do better or worse then my peers, did I do better then myself matters more to me. Yeah it tells me if my score goes up or down but it seems to be slightly timed based too as if you don‚Äôt finish you score better then 0% of your peers. Um, nope pretty sure time wise I probably scored better then at least MY last attempt so that‚Äôs improvement if it would only keep track of stuff like that for me. And that‚Äôs where the whole ‚Äòpeers‚Äô thing falls down for me. I didn‚Äôt grow up during this whole internet/text a page a second era & I know as far as my real ‚Äòpeers‚Äô go I‚Äôm actually weird with how well I do with it so I‚Äôm pretty sure saying I‚Äôm doing 50% better then my peers at a game that is basically all about tapping speed is comparing me to, at best, kids like mine who at least can text a paragraph a second, & not my actual ‚Äòpeers‚Äô who have trouble doing a word a second never mind a sentence in a minute. It would be nice to be able to turn that feature off as to me it is completely worthless, and the ability to have it track exactly how I‚Äôm improving with each game not only going from 1000 to 1020 score wise but actually going from passing 3 stages to 4 out of the 7 needed to complete &/or beating my last time through would be better variables to track for me. Other than that it‚Äôs a really good app to pick up & keep your brain engaged."

1,holiday247cs,Deleted after 5 minutes. There are Ads between every game. You play for 30 seconds and there is a 30 second Ad.
1,Beautiful_bee09,"Why can‚Äôt we just enjoy a game that works our mind for free. Every time you finish a level an ad pops up.... every...single...game. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Trust me, don‚Äôt bother to get this game. Now if it was ad free then I would say totally but trust me, it‚Äôs a waste of time."
1,Zidex,"Clearly they have purchased all of these wonder reviews. This app is nothing but a money grab.  These people are worse than the IRS, you will pay them.. and they will make you pay them. Greedy."
4,amelia784,Enjoyable but it‚Äôs not free and says you can turn off auto renew but there is no option to do so

You would be better off not wasting your time with this money-grabbing trash.
1,Griswold63,3 day free trial and then $7 a week or $40 a year or $50 lifetime. Not a realistic free trial period.  And too much to pay for something you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs any good.

1,Boyrecon,after just two levels of trial and their annoying ads
1,Gus Oenning,Can‚Äôt play the game they were advertising for. It‚Äôs a paid app and if you don‚Äôt subscribe you will be watching more ads than playing games.
1,s8i71176-811184,"$10/week, that I never agreed to other than by clicking ‚ÄúGet‚Äù, so be careful if you click ‚ÄúGet‚Äù.   I deleted the app after the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial of a whopping 3 days, and was still getting charged $9.99/WEEK. BOOOOOOO!!!!"
1,Hdbchhdbd,The only way you can get away with not giving them your money is if you‚Äôre okay with watching tons of ads. Just a waste of time if you don‚Äôt pay their fees. Lame

1,Miss c bell,They charged me 6.99 weekly over the span of a year! I thought I canceled subscription. That‚Äôs over 300 dollars per year. Super frustrated. I hate auto renew. Never again!!!

1,Duffy71&$,You should put the cost right up front right away instead of making somebody go through all that nonsense.
5,My grandma favorite,Because I do
1,meme.addict,"Yes they have a 3 day free trial, but this an expensive product at $28/mo. Apple should post all subscription fees up front in the App Store to avoid wasting user‚Äôs time. Also three days is far too short for a trial."

5,jennbekk,Super fun and challenging way to improve memory
1,cpblake,This application is robbing you in plain site! Make sure to look at the prices ($6.99 per week) vs ($39 a year) and ($49 Lifetime). So don‚Äôt be like most people who purchase this subscription for the 3 day free trial and forget! Haha
5,TapsDal,Interesting and fun brain games!
1,Unlinedrabbit,So i was downloading for the iq test (there should be a few ads for obvious reasons) but i had to watch somewhere between 20-40 ads to finish it that is excessive
1,Chrisc_80,Yay another subscription. The app that disguises as a game and try to get you to sign up before you get to see what it is all about. This is just the equivalent of the QVC just thieves trying to get their hands in my pocket
1,coopertheboxer,I downloaded this a few minutes ago. In those few minutes I watched more ads than I used the app. Deleting now
1,veronicafjames,I deleted the app before the free subscription ended and they charged me. And then they charged me again after I had been cancelled for weeks. I want my money back because I canceled like I was supposed to.
3,Kholsey,Cools app but the prices don‚Äôt make any sense AT ALL! üòÇüòÇüòÇ PASS! I‚Äôll stick with the ELEVATE brain training app. I would suggest everyone else does too. Or Luminosity.
1,spiunti,After I got rid of this app and it‚Äôs not working trying to contact through the link. I would really like a refund it was the last of my money for the week.
1,Mageemp5,There are way too many other brain training games that don‚Äôt require you to watch an ad between each game to put up with this.  I deleted it.
1,Kmort5,I paid for the one time fee of $35 and this app worked for 3 days... now all there is is a white screen when I open it. I have deleted the app and re downloaded it but it will not work.
3,mbmaddy,I need to speak to costumer services. The app renewed even after I canceled. I no longer want access and hoping for a refund.
5,Ramdgo,"Thank you, fun and easy to follow"
1,Lehumeses,You know it‚Äôs bad when they don‚Äôt actually let you try the app out. Rather you have to subscribe to see your test results

1,mdrmusik,"Told me I got a ‚Äúgift‚Äù after I only wanted the free trial, selected the gift of ‚Äú89%‚Äù off yearly plan, which I selected and didn‚Äôt mean to, which ended up taking $33 dollars out of my bank account."
1,BeccaS77,A small handful of repetitive games I lost interest in after a couple of days and like 5 tests. None of the ones they advertised on Instagram.

5,LTRoman,"Fun, informative and keeps me engaged"
1,David D Morven,"The games are fun and challenging, how ever you have to watch 45 seconds of ad material between every single level and more between games."
1,admgrin,I like the concept. However $7 a week for the ‚Äúbasic plan‚Äù is overpriced. The endless ads on Instagram are annoying. Deleting this as much as possible is a no-brainer.
1,MusicNinja7,Just fyi before taking time to download. This is Listed under free games with in app purchase options. Once I put in my preferences the next page was going to make me pay to play. I deleted the app.
1,44killer44,This app has potential but they want you to buy a subscription to play the game or play a 5 second game and watch a 1 minute ad for 5 seconds of play...this app is only here to steal your money
1,Blue Candace,"The free subscription clearly states to cancel in the settings sections before the 3 day trial ends. However, there is no option to cancel once you download the app."
1,Myself_inVenus,It doesn‚Äôt charge to download it.. but as soon as you open you have to choose a payment plan.. so do go for it if you at looking for something free
1,Nite flute,$9.99 a week?!?! That‚Äôs 4x the cost of Netflix! You really expect people to get 4x the use of Netflix out of this app. This app is clearly focused on getting kids to use their parents money on it and having people‚Äôs free trials lapse. Pretty gross way to make money.
2,Sandy üèùÔ∏è,You‚Äôre going to have to pay a lot for this. The games are decent though.
5,fearless foxbluekingdom,Its fun and really works
1,Nickname‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.3,I initially signed up for a free 3 day trial and within the first 5 mins of trying out this app I was ‚Äúduped‚Äù into a one year subscription at a discounted rate. Shady money making tactics which is unfortunate.

1,K1ZM3T1984,The app may be good but I was looking for a career testing app and the add on Facebook said that is what I was downloading. So for your great marketing efforts you get 2 stars. Probably a great app but your company is full of crap.

1,FLOuie,"You download this to check it out, but they don‚Äôt the only choice they give you is try for 3 days and pay. Disappointing!!!"
1,NoWins617,There is advertising to make money and then there is this app. It is ad cancer. Any click results in an ad. Uninstalled after 5 minutes
1,GummyBlocks,This app is not free. You have to pay to even use it once you download it. Go find a free version don‚Äôt waste your time and money with this.
1,Sevgi cicis,Another app that tries to sneak in to charge you! I have paid over $70 for this uninteresting app in 2-3 months. Go get Elevate for half of the price and 100x better exercises and integrity.
1,peacheasy,"Sing you up for a subscription before you can even try it, ads that link to external websites and mimic part of the game. Apple doesn‚Äôt usually allow junk this bad."

1,Trent92,I wouldn't write a bad review if the app didn't say it was free. Moment you get done with the survey at the beginning everything is locked behind a paywall. Wasted my time.

5,Coach Rashaad,It keeps me mentally occupied and stimulated. Helps me a lot
5,SupaFly_1990,This game is truly helpful for improving mental agility.
1,mr. fruatrated,You spend 3x more time watching ads than playing the game. Not impressed. A game like this should have significantly less ads.
1,Klane7909,I get that your mode is subscription based but it‚Äôs just a wasted download if I don‚Äôt know that until I take the survey. Just tell people the cost up front.
1,Walt1223,"I really hate when an add shows one game and the app is totally different. Don‚Äôt bother, there are so many ads and you can‚Äôt play what you want."
1,Thisquinn,"Could not keep playing because once ad popped up, the ad would not close after playing no matter how much I pressed the X."
1,MelBWerner,NO FREE. once you‚Äôre download you are forced to choose a payment option before you can even experience the app and how it works. Don‚Äôt download unless you are looking to pay up to $32
1,Gibblegab,No free features except like 2 games. It will have you do a whole test then make you pay to see the results. Lame.
5,enjoyxsummer,I enjoy the challenge.
1,ArielG012,I started with a free trial and reports are still locked behind a paywall and the app is aggressive in trying to get you to commit by gamifying discounts on the yearly plan. Credibility went out the window for me.
1,Johnson Chon,Careful when downloading this app. It automatically subscribes you after the free trial without telling you g you
1,TheFacts420,App basically begs for money. Offers a free trial with premium access but half the games or quizzes require you to pay the subscription to get the ‚Äúresults‚Äù
5,dottowne,Difficult but challenging
5,Bre@d25,Help knows your abilities for the mind
1,Reddytocodeeee,It allows you to take long tests but then you can't see the results until you pay.
1,tototollero34543,Pay. We need you to pay or watch 100 ads. Just let people try it before you insist they sign up.
5,mmmorg512,Awesome app! I love all the brain training games
1,Under Achiever,"This game caused me more stress than it relaxed me due to all the ads. I‚Äôm OK with ads if I don‚Äôt pay, but I‚Äôm not OK with the length of the ads and the frequency. This app got deleted."
5,Noamojica,Very good
1,teknikal242,"I am using free trial. I spend 10 minutes answering a survey, and it asks me for money to get results. I guess the app did teach me something, but I did not appreciate the lesson."

5,PaigieSny,There are so many fun games to play!
1,This1isthetruth,They auto renew after a very short trial period. You have to give credit card information just to try it. They claim to diagnose and treat mental illnesses
3,MysterTimmyV,Using a free trial but it seems expensive after that‚Ä¶
1,Remy 234,"They try to upcharge you just to see the results on your test, even if you‚Äôre on the free trial. Ridiculous."

1,rocc-o,They say free trial but then you have to go through your internal settings (outside of the app) to cancel the auto renewal by your Apple ID. Totally a predatory model to take advantage of people.

1,WolfPangolin,the in-app purchases label is misleading and you require a subscription after your free trial is up so to me it‚Äôs a boldface lie to claim it is a free app with in-app purchases when it‚Äôs in fact not free whatsoever.

5,Keitiv,That‚Äôs super helpful
1,Ughughughboo,1. No one should be diagnosed by an app. Go see a professional. This is unethical. 2. You have to get a PAID subscription only for them to advertise consistently a more EXPENSIVE PAID subscription. SCAM

1,odonata6,Terrible app. Wants a monthly subscription to play some extremely basic games. Can‚Äôt even find the brain teaser they showcase in the ad.
1,Level1767,I see reviews that mention the first 3 days are free. That wasn‚Äôt the case for me. It would not allow me to access anything without agreeing to $7/week. Then why is the app download free?

1,WEMasters,AND you have to watch ads. I can‚Äôt get a refund so I reported the app. The ratings on your phone are not the same ratings on your desktop. This app is rated much lower there.

When I went to download it I saw that it was much more than that. It claimed to be something to improve your mental health/anxiety. Okay, I'm in! Well, it seems like everyone gets the same games, there's nothing in them to help with mental health and the app is so aggressive and misleading on the subscription plan. I did the free 3-day trial and then played some games. Afterwards it said I had won 92% off a year subscription. When I said no I don't want to do that, (I'm testing the all to see if it's something I would want to continue with...hence a trial? it told me that this was my only chance for this discount so act now! I said no. I played around with the app more and discovered the the discount was still actually being offered. Okay, that's nice, but don't lie and say it was a one-time offer. I've also noticed in reading the developers responses to reviews, that offer is available to everyone (""less than the price of a daily cup of coffee!!"" üôÑ). I then went to why I downloaded the app, the quiz to tell you about yourself. I take it and ope, can't see anything except one line of text unless you pay! But I'm on a free trial? Oh nope sorry that's not included. But if you pay $4.99 you can have the full report! Look this all would be much more tolerable if the app didn't lie or withhold information in their advertising. Say upfront that to see the full report (outside of ONE line of text) you have to pay for a subscription or buy each report. Also, don't advertise something that's geared towards neurodivergent people and then try to con them into paying odles of money for an app that is just a bunch of brain games. ‚úåÔ∏è"

5,pfhfudhruhdhdd,So far this is a amazing app! I‚Äôm 12 with adhd
1,Jkcon,This app is basically unusable unless you pay money.
5,Liriano1998,Worth the lifetime subscription!
1,Christie y,I just got it on my phone. It‚Äôs free the 3 days then $6.99 a week! I did not read  anything about that in the app page.
1,pumpkin_2406,There was an ad every 3 questions. I got impatient and deleted the app because I couldn‚Äôt learn nor enjoy myself.
1,Andychives,I hate these ads where they call it a free app but then want $50 for the app. I will never buy an app that has such crappy management.
1,Musedesigns,"Before I even get started a 30 second add pops up. Oh but before anything you want money, Na I‚Äôm good. Thanks For wasting my time and data downloading your game."
1,Hamm911,Do not download unless you plan to pay $6.99 a week. If it would let me I wouldn‚Äôt even give it one star because I couldn‚Äôt even get to the game.
1,stash011,Should have to pay for these type of things
1,Hsox05,"This shouldn‚Äôt be listed in the free section, because the very first thing it does is make you sign up for a subscription agreement to even begin playing"
1,Shah_1998,It‚Äôs just a blank white screen when I load up the app and on top of that it‚Äôs a scam to just take your money.
5,AngelicaRoseT,Great game to sharpen mental skills. Very fun and even relaxing!
1,Daddy0000,This is not a serious app. Want to improve your intelligence? Read a book. Serious buyers regret.

5,TheMattReedProject,ü´°
5,CharMack4E,"Them game is awesome! It really passes the time and helps to give your brain an easy workout. I have to say what it is that I mean by easy. It is it‚Äôs not as intense or strenuous as some other games I‚Äôve tried. However, you find yourself leveling up and having a lot more functionality than most games and having more consistency! It doesn‚Äôt  feel forced at times I forget it a Brain training game or something!!!  I really do enjoy the challenges that go along with your pace and levels of intensity to build a strong training base that works well for you and your brain! ‚ò∫Ô∏è It really works to even wind down. I have MS (Multiple Sclerosis) as well as ADHD, High Anxiety Disorder. It‚Äôs a great tool to keep your mind occupied but in a way that is benefiting to your needs. Very creative with a wide variety and assortment of different styles of games to create a unique experience for each player!! The cognitive games are so much easier and I see it in my daily routine. Unfortunately I only have a  ‚Äú3 day pass/trial‚Äù, I can only imagine the gains from this game if it was a longer trial run. Or even free! I would say that it is possible to get more of a higher quality of life! I don‚Äôt have the funds to extended. But I did want to be sure to share my thoughts and experience with  others seeking some of these same beneficial gains from the game!! It‚Äôs definitely worth a try and see how it works out for you and your brain!  üôÉüòâ Hope this helps and leaves someone else feeling a bit more confident about the game! To motivate themselves to give it a try and see what they can improve on in their training session!! I definitely recommend it if you‚Äôre wanting to strengthen your brain and your overall mental health!  It‚Äôs a great tool to add to your toolkit!    Thank you, ‚ÄúImpulse-Brain Training‚Äù !!!  (Btw, yes I am a real and regular person with a brain in need of staying sharp and help with training it for the rest of my time! As well as one who is grateful to have came across a game, that worked for me! I am sharing My own words and thoughts about the Game and overall experiences in a short timeframe)  ‚ô•Ô∏èüíØ  Stay Blessed, Charlynne Herrington"

1,TennVol18,"6/25 Update: Developer reached out with basically a canned response and said to send feedback to their support address, which I‚Äôve already done via their website. It‚Äôs noted in my review, had they taken the time to read it. They‚Äôre not interested in feedback or reviews. If I could give 0 stars, I would absolutely do that. What a waste of my time and money.   This seemed like a great brain game app at the beginning. I got a great deal to purchase a subscription, so I jumped at it. About 3-4 weeks in, I realized I was quickly failing at the games I was previously good at, and wasn‚Äôt getting any better at. The games never provided tips for improving my performance, and when prompted if I liked the game, I usually left feedback about how to make it more usable (give more time, provide tips/tricks for getting better, etc.). I‚Äôve submitted feedback via the app and the company‚Äôs website and have never, ever received a reply. I‚Äôve tried hard over these last 2-3 months to get better at the games and I sincerely enjoyed the relaxing games. But the company never really seemed to care about what its users had to say about the game or their (lack of progress). How does this help my brain? Does failure help my brain in the same way success does? Is THAT what you‚Äôre testing? This company doesn‚Äôt care about its users, doesn‚Äôt care about their brains or their successes or failures. They simply want to see if we‚Äôll pay for the pleasure of constantly failing at something for the sake of keeping up our streak. No more. Deleted. Subscription canceled."

5,New plant?,"So, for years I‚Äôve been in this slump where I‚Äôve been wanting to improve my brain and actually develop myself rather than continue to rot my brain by watching TV literally all day or lounging in my bedroom or living room(I‚Äôve had a pretty forgiving life and gentle parents, so being spoiled is something I‚Äôve gotten accustomed to.. but haven‚Äôt exactly enjoyed the thought of).  But, after understanding and finally putting pieces together in my autistic brain.. I‚Äôm starting to figure out that learning can be enjoyable and fun rather than just a chore or a boring thing I need to will through, school really reinforced bad habits in understanding that learning actually had potential benefits to my ‚Äúwork for yourself‚Äù attitude rather than being something you need to tough through.  My goal with buying this app fully is to improve my brains functionality back to what it used to be before I started indulging in draining stimulants, whether it would be something like TV and Video games.. or my lowest point: using marijuana to be okay with my situation as a dopamine replacement for the happiness I strive for.  I pray this works, it‚Äôs up to me now with my life.. and I ought to start taking care of all the little parts that make me up, if all those little cells want me to live.. THEN I GOT TO LIVE AND BE STRONGER FOR THEM, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, EVERYONE ON EARTH AND BEYOND, AND FOR GOD OR WHATEVER ENERGY COMPRISES THE UNIVERSE!  I don‚Äôt want to master life, I want to master myself."

4,Staceypdx,"Seems to hit on a number of areas of cognitive growth.  Games are fun and short so easy to fit into a day.   I would highly suggest that   1.  All puzzles  should have explanations that help user learn.  Some do (they include hints etc. )but others don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt let a user progress or discover how to learn the skill. The entire game is blocked from that point on.   This should be about expanding the brain and so should include learning. Even some of the hints should be reexamined so users can master skills.   2. I would suggest that with all games user can repeat levels rather than forcing user to procede in a linear direction to a blocked point. Practicing at a difficult level could help someone better master higher levels.  Again, it seems like someone has skipped the idea of helping person expand skills and learn. The reason why folks have purchased this app is a drive to improve. There are lots of these games available on other apps where you can simply try and fail. The puzzles are particularly bad regarding this linear set up.    3 I have avoided the IQ tests because it has been proven that intelligence is multi modal and I highly doubt that a quick quiz can be anything but irregular and flawed.  The app seems to tend toward pigeon holing people and ranking by percentile and I feel like that can shut down a persons ability to see possibilities for expansion.   4. As for daily grading, the percentiles seem like a bad way to give feedback. Again, this is a comparison to others (why?). Instead the freeback  could include individual improvement comparing past scores to current scores. Or, it could indicate strengths and weaknesses ie speed accuracy with goals included.   5.  There will need to be more or varied games if many of the games have blocks."

4,Colonel_Plague,"Found this app as an add on social media, and I like it. There are daily ‚Äúworkouts‚Äù (series of brain-using games) that are accustomed to your necessities (memory, intelligence, reading, etc), and tests that are almost like therapy. I say ‚Äúalmost‚Äù because they give you the classification you are & not an explanation except... Like any other free-to-play game, they have a premium package where they do give the following:  ‚ÄìFull report on Tests (classification & explanation)  ‚ÄìEvery game on there (only few are free to access) ‚Äì3-day free trial (before purchasing the package)  I can‚Äôt state the rest because of both privacy reasons and me not using premium (see other reviews for more).   Are there problems & requests I would add? Well, yes. If you got this far, you might‚Äôve seen a couple of them, but just in case, I‚Äôll reiterate them here:   -Few of the games are free to access (meaning every other game is not) -Without the Premium, reports do not give an explanation (meaning you‚Äôd have to look for a therapist or through the Internet, to which I say good luck with the latter)  My only requests? Well, to fix one of the two. For the games, maybe allow people to unlock one game per month of their choosing (make them pick one of three, if you want to). For the tests, give a full report (should you want people to still buy the premium, make 3/5 full reports or less, I don‚Äôt care). There are some people who might need more but cannot buy it all. For those people, they might need a chance to help enhance their necessities while giving them a chance.   I‚Äôll be okay with what you do, and am happy for the moment. The future? That‚Äôs to be determined, but with high hopes.   -Tenshino"

2,9@@9@::,"I just wanted to share my experience with the app.  Not even a day after having it and i‚Äôm deleting. I originally found this app on a tiktok add, expecting it to be a fun way to expand my brain but it‚Äôs all a hoax. Originally i was going to give this at least 3 stars, but now it‚Äôs a 2 because of these reasons.  1. The constant ads  You may think I‚Äôm exaggerating, but i‚Äôm not. Not even 5 minutes after purchasing the app and i‚Äôm getting ads. It‚Äôs not even the occasional ad, but the ads after every. single. level. It‚Äôs astonishing how little i got into the app before getting the exact same little hay-day ad, or that stupid little clownfish one.   Now with the ads on the bottom of your screen while exploring the app, they have a small little button with a X on the corner of them. You may think ‚ÄúOh yeah, that will definitely close the ad!‚Äù Nope. It leads you to a purchase page for No Ads.   2. Waste of time  I got bored of trying out the brain games (more like watching ads) and wanted to try something else. I came across the Tests tab and took one of the tests out of curiosity. I spent a full 7 minutes going though 40+ questions, just to get ONE WORD? You want to know why? Because the explanation is locked behind a pay wall.  3. Can‚Äôt take a hint  After downloading any app, you can expect to see a pop-up asking you to enable notifications correct? So it does happen, and i press decline because I want to occasional open this game and play, not be notified every day right? So I press decline, continue on.   Later on into the day I open the app up again and am greeted to another pop up asking me to enable notifications. Now I‚Äôm confused because I thought i already said I don‚Äôt want to. I again press no, and continue on. The third time I open it does the same exact thing and i‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm deleting this god forsaken app.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  And that‚Äôs it really. Thanks for reading this all, and I hope the creators can help make this app a little better."

2,Ms_T1gger,"There are so many things I  really do not like with this app over the last couple of years. So much so, I am cancelling my subscription...I have had for years!.   As stated in my previous feedback, I complied with steps to reload my progress; however, your team told me to redo the very same steps I told them I complied with doing! These steps do not work for me; so, I have lost 233 days this time. The app's update wiped them out and will not reload. Since this is the second time this occurred with me while I have been a customer (first time, I lost 345 days), it is frustrating to always be ""starting over.""   Additionally, the new format is less than stellar as to how I want to workout my focus. In order to get credit for the day, I MUST complete what your Autobot tells me to do without any method to select games/exercises within that focus. This was a great way to change things up for me...I keep having the same exercises loaded for me to accomplish each day. How is this beneficial? If I aced an area, why keep giving me that area and telling me I beat 99% of my peers? If I don't do that well, I immediately get told I did not do well and the % I did do better than. This is not a good motivation for me. It may work for some, but not for me. I like seeing my progress, but seeing the comparison right after the exercise? No...good or bad! Let me find it in my profile breakdown!  Finally, I have maxed-out several of the games a long time ago: Draw One Line, Robotic Flows, Candy Sort, Word Search, etc. There have been no new uploads, and I have redone all of the aforementioned games from start to finish 2-3 times.  As far as the tests, I completed most of them. Neat info.   This app is slowly decreasing its effectiveness and draw for me, and I doubt I am the only one...especially, if the customers have been with the app for a long time like me."

2,joytunes02,"My BAD notes: When I saw an ad for this app, it was portrayed as something to help me with my crazy ADHD. I quickly downloaded and started the free trial. After playing one game, it gave me the opportunity to select a special prize which was a major discount off the yearly subscription price - but you have to decide right then or you lose it. My IMPULSIVITY kicked in and a made the purchase. After doing this and exploring a little more of the app, I quickly realized that this app had nothing to do with managing ADHD. I tried to give the app the benefit of the doubt and explored it a little more, only to find that every game, quiz, and exercise it had, I could find online or in the App Store for free. It was just, overall, very boring to me. So, with much frustration, I cancelled my yearly subscription that I had had for 20 MINUTES and deleted the app, knowing that I had completely zero interest in ever opening it again.   Now the GOOD notes: The app is very well designed. It‚Äôs kinda cool I guess to have every test, game, and brain exercises you could want in one place. Some of the tests seem to be quite extensive (the IQ tests). It‚Äôs a high quality app for sure, but all of its shine is there to cover up its lack of originality and actual practical use.  It‚Äôs funny that an app called ‚Äúimpulse‚Äù would take advantage of one‚Äôs impulsivity to Locke them into a yearly subscription for something before they‚Äôve had the chance to actually figure out what the app has to offer."

2,JoshLucas,"I recently upgraded to the full version of ‚ÄúImpulse: Brain Training‚Äù and have been genuinely enjoying the diverse range of games it offers. However, I‚Äôve encountered some inconsistencies that are affecting my overall experience.  Firstly, the accuracy metrics in the games appear to be flawed. For instance, I achieved a 99% accuracy in a game, only to be informed that I surpassed ‚Äú0% of others at this level.‚Äù In a subsequent attempt with 95% accuracy, it indicated that I surpassed ‚Äú39% of others.‚Äù Such contradictory data is confusing and undermines my confidence in the system‚Äôs reliability.  Moreover, the calculation of overall rankings seems illogical. Despite achieving the maximum score of 5,000 in every ‚Äúattention‚Äù game, my overall ‚Äúattention‚Äù score is inexplicably at 97%. Without any clear path to improve this score, it‚Äôs perplexing as to why it isn‚Äôt at 100%.  Additionally, there‚Äôs a noticeable discrepancy in the difficulty levels of the games. A stark example is ‚ÄúMatch the Pairs‚Äù at level 5, where the challenge is disproportionately higher compared to other memory games. This level requires matching 14 pairs of emojis in a very short time frame, a task I‚Äôve found to be exceedingly difficult compared to the other games in the same category. This significant inconsistency in difficulty further erodes my trust in the game‚Äôs design and effectiveness.  Despite these issues, I must commend the overall quality of the games. However, the questionable data and unbalanced difficulty levels significantly detract from the experience. It would greatly enhance the app if these aspects could be addressed and improved."

1,Strange Xodarap,"I was enjoying the app. The games were simple, the tests were alright. I liked seeing the comparisons from what others have achieved. I did the personality archetype test which took 5+ minutes  just to get an ad for the 15th+ time to pay for my results LOL.   1. I don‚Äôt mind paying for good apps, I‚Äôve paid for many. This ad approach made me delete the app & leave a negative review.   2. It‚Äôs predatory. Many apps do it, I deleted each one. Not everyone has the discipline to not purchase because they want to see their hard earned results & they‚Äôll cave in. DO NOT download this app if you don‚Äôt have self control as this app will eat your hard earned money for essentially nothing at all. Its absolutely predatory & that‚Äôs exactly their goal. They couldn‚Äôt care less about the individual, only care about the money. Sad!  3. Don‚Äôt bother responding. Even if the app became 100% free, I wouldn‚Äôt redownload it. You vultures know exactly what you‚Äôre doing to people. What a shame. Using psychology to trap people these days is really sad. I rarely leave reviews but felt compelled to do so for other people. Yes, many companies do it, almost all advertising is these days BUT doing it the way you‚Äôre doing it is wrong & predatory. It‚Äôs manipulative.   4. If you‚Äôve got money to blow, by all means it‚Äôs an okay app from what I used. However, I don‚Äôt recommend even downloading this app at all if you‚Äôre on a budget. The ‚Äúfree‚Äù with ads version is awful. There‚Äôs an ad every few levels & constantly begs you to pay.   5. Save your money. This was a complete waste of time. Hopefully someone out there appreciates the review, don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

1,Truthspeeeeker,"I recently downloaded the Impulse app, lured by its promise of offering intriguing personality tests and quizzes that seemed both fun and insightful. Unfortunately, my experience with the app has been anything but positive, revealing a scheme designed to trick and manipulate users into spending money.  **False Advertising:**  The Impulse app markets itself as a free platform where users can take a variety of tests. However, this is a classic bait-and-switch tactic. The app allows you to start taking a test, letting you believe you'll receive the results for free. You spend a significant amount of time answering questions, expecting to gain some valuable insights at the end. But alas, once you complete the test, you‚Äôre hit with a paywall demanding $6 to access your results. This is not a free service as advertised‚Äîit's a cleverly disguised trap.  **Deceptive Practices:**  This app thrives on the disappointment of its users. By letting you invest your time and effort into completing a test, it creates a sunk cost fallacy where you feel compelled to pay just to see what you‚Äôve spent time on. This tactic preys on the natural human tendency to see tasks through to the end, exploiting it for monetary gain. It's manipulative and unethical.  **Lack of Transparency:**  Nowhere in the app description or during the onboarding process does Impulse clearly state that payment is required to see test results. This lack of transparency is a red flag. If they genuinely believed in the value of their service, they wouldn't need to resort to such underhanded methods to extract money from users.  **Poor User Experience:**  Beyond the shady business practices, the app itself isn't impressive. The user interface is cluttered, and the experience is riddled with ads. Even before hitting the paywall, you're bombarded with constant pop-ups and promotions for other services. This diminishes any enjoyment you might have gotten from using the app.  **Customer Service:**  Attempts to reach out to their customer service are met with generic responses that do little to address user concerns. They seem more interested in brushing off complaints than genuinely resolving them, further cementing the idea that they care more about profits than user satisfaction.  **Final Verdict:**  Impulse is a textbook example of an app that prioritizes profit over user experience. Its misleading practices, lack of transparency, and subpar interface make it a waste of time. If you‚Äôre looking for genuine, insightful quizzes and tests, I recommend steering clear of this app. There are plenty of other platforms that respect their users and offer a more honest service.  In conclusion, avoid the Impulse app if you value your time and money. It's a deceptive cash grab, and there are far better options available that won‚Äôt try to trick you into spending your hard-earned money."

5,jules7549,"I really enjoy the games, puzzles, tests, insights, and rewards (badges) offered by this app.  I‚Äôm 54 and a former Sr. Software Engineer. I‚Äôve been on disability for 15 years and have felt my mental acuity slipping.  Impulse has proven to improve my memory. I am impressed with the program- the code is solid and I‚Äôve yet to encounter a bug. Impulse is an excellent app that includes many facets of brain training. I highly recommend this app."
1,It's me hiiiii!,"This app is actually very creative, but I can‚Äôt stand the fact that the games you can‚Äôt play are black and white, but the tests aren‚Äôt. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN COLOR, YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST,BUT TPIT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RESULTS!!!So what is the point in taking it?. Please be more considerate.OTHERWISE the app is good!‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,sgjorven,I signed up for the 1 month subscription at a discount then cancelled but have been charged for months with no reply from the company. This is no longer in my subscription but I monthly get charged $29.98 with no Apple receipt. They got me for 5 months so far and impossible to get the issue resolved.
5,caydogi,awesome
4,deedlebugg,They did charge only $49.99
1,77LDJ,"After the free trial I was charged $26. When the next  charge was, $49.95, pending, I don‚Äôt see a way to cancel. I texted them to unsubscribe me before I‚Äôm charged.  Instead I got a text with instructions that don‚Äôt work and was charged. I texted back and hope I don‚Äôt get the auto reply. I don‚Äôt know how to  cancel this app."
5,My eight-year-old loves it,It‚Äôs a beautiful game. I love it. You should probably download it. It‚Äôs free. You just have to press the faded away X at the top left.bye y‚Äôall:)
5,penelope246810,This app is so good I have anxiety and I will say it‚Äôs helped and even being young this app helped a LOT. It pushes my brain and updates me every day. I was watching YouTube and I notified me and I jumped on this app . Definitely get it!
5,Monster dopeness,I have terrible anxiety and I get stressed very easily and when I stumbled on this game I thought it was a joke but in actuality it‚Äôs phenomenal. Whenever I get upset or am freaking out I just play a couple games of this and I feel great!
1,Sassy Red Gal,"$15.99 per year isn‚Äôt a bad price, but a 60 second commercial if someone doesn‚Äôt want to pay? Ridiculous. The developers are already benefitting financially and otherwise for mining data."
1,SushiBT,I was loving the games until I found out the $15.99 annual subscription only included some of the games and I am locked out of the rest. The App Store now says a premium subscription is $6.99 which unlocks all the games. No where in App Store does it say you only get a few games and then must pay more to get all the games. The App Store should be clear of what you are getting and the total cost off apps. I contacted the developer but got no response. Will certainly not be renewing this subscription.
5,Chop4678,Smart n shi
1,okeydokey54,"I downloaded this app thinking that it will be a good for me but realize that I no longer wanted that when I went to void the app there was no cancel button. I find nowhere to cancel this app or it‚Äôs just subscriptions only a monthly basis the first month they charge $19.98 which I thought was going to be the monthly subscription two weeks later they charge me $39.98. I called to dispute the charge at my bank, and had my card changed and it still was able to get to my account how I don‚Äôt know, but I will find out. I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to cancel this app in service but have not been able to do so. My advice to you don‚Äôt purchase the app. There‚Äôs nowhere to cancel it so my only option is to go to my bank and close my account."
1,haihai279,got the app and i MADE SURE i didnt click any subscriptions because id rather die than spend over $10 on an app. it tried charging my card $33.45 on a year subscription that i did not agree to and now i still have to pay it or i cant download any apps and cant update any. im disappointed.

1,Soul F.,"Not challenging at all, regret I paid 49.99 for it"
4,eagle brown 13,"I like this game because it has fun brain games that can challenge me sometimes.But a downside of the game is after every game there is an add ,but other than that I think that it‚Äôs a genially good game that you should definitely try playing."

5,Kendyjean,I have seizure disorder and I am using this application to help me with my anxiety and memory issues. It helps a lot.Thanks impulse.  I would like to remain anonymous but I hope there are others out there who this app can help as well.
1,Orion2k5,Too easy it‚Äôs always 100-98%
5,RyanWRedshaw,Great platform for cognitive maintenance
4,JaxlrealmYT,"I‚Äôve been using impulse for a few days now and I love it. It fun and while I use it I feel like I‚Äôm doing something useful besides watching YouTube shorts and TikTok so I really enjoy this app. It‚Äôs just I hate how there‚Äôs a premium but at least they have a three day trial so overall this is a good game and it would be five stars, but the premium makes it hard. thanks for reading. -JaxlrealmYT out"
5,DebsToo,"2 of your problem solving games require not problem solving but thumbs without arthritis. Sort the trash and arrows direction both require flexibility and speed of your thumbs to tap the color on both sides of your phone or swiping from both sides to get a good score. Could you work on some more problem solving games that don‚Äôt require both thumbs?  Spy anagrams, tricky patterns, phone number secret code, grocery list I do well, but that recycling, my thumbs don‚Äôt work that way anymore! Thanks, love even the challenging math!"
1,9tinman0,"I did the first 3 trainings, seems like a fun and helpful app. However, after the initial training you get a reward, you get to pick a box, which has a discount offer. Mine was 92% m for the yearly plan, which shows it will be billed as $28.99 ($.56/week vs $6.99/week) yearly. Sounds like a great discount, right? WRONG. The PRO yearly subscription (most expensive sub.) is $79.99, 92% off would be $6.40 ($.12/week). $28 is 92% of $350! During set up there was a lifetime subscription option for $79.99, however, there isn‚Äôt an option for it under the subscriptions in settings."

1,Liv*Olivia,This app was not what I expected and I canceled within the time frame of 24hrs of me down loading the app. I request for a refund and it was denied by apple. I tries reaching out the company themselves Never heard from them and its been almost a year and I still have not received my 36.00. Plus I have already reached out to apple and was denied with no explanation. They referred me to contact brain impulse. I gotten no response from support@brainimpulse. I just want my money back
5,skyburd1257,"I‚Äôm thirteen, and I‚Äôm trying to not sleep on the bus,so I got this game because it keeps my brain from just falling out of my head.So yeah works pretty good. p.s yeah I‚Äôm a thirteen year old that has som grammar weird right."
5,mykailahmarye,I love this app! It keeps me relaxed and keeps my mind occupied instead of scrolling online.
1,Yabby46773,"I use the app everyday and used the app last night as well. However Today, on August 14 ‚Äò24, when I opened the app, it crashed and closed immediately. I tried multiple times and it didn‚Äôt work. Even a restart of my phone did not work. It‚Äôs disappointing to pay almost $30 to have such bugs in the app where there is no way for customer to use it. Please apply a fix or refund the amount.  I tried to use the feedback form on the developers website (gmrd.net) but the feedback form is broken as well and current send the message there."
4,Mamabearut,"This app is amazing and so relaxing. I always like doing something with my brain every day and not waist away watching YouTube. There is just one problem, so my IQ is 125 but I feel like it went down because of how much brain rot ads there are. So please in the future try to censor some of the ads."
1,YayaMuah,I purchased the year plan.  A few weeks later I noticed two charges of $17.05 I questioned my bank why there are 2 charges for 17.05.  They dispute one of the duplicate charges and suddenly I lose my subscription.  No one to call or email for help. Now I have to dispute the 1st charge too    Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
5,read fluently,"Impulses sleek design and simple games and tests really have improved my mental state! I‚Äôm more prepared for when school starts, but I would love to have less times asking for me to buy premium. I want to know more about myself without paying. Anyway, the games have improved my attention span that had been decimated by YouTube shorts! Try this out with your kids, the games are engaging and so much fun! Unlike other mind apps, I don‚Äôt get bored of it! The IQ test results surprised me! I thought maybe I had a mediocre score since I‚Äôm on the younger end, but, I got 54 questions right with an IQ of 153! Amazing tests that are accurate!   All in all, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but impulse is an exception! Try it out! You can always change your mind."

5,grassi2,It‚Äôs a great tool for getting my brain going in the morning. I‚Äôve struggled with ADHD and distractions my whole life. This is my second day of using the app and I‚Äôm enjoying it so far.  The puzzles and games seem to be a more productive way of spending my first 20 minutes in the morning rather than scrolling through YouTube. We will see how far this goes in improving my mental state.
4,LFCMarcelo,"So far I have enjoyed using it and with the offer for 15.99 for the first month(for Impulse Pro), it is worth it. Could be 5 stars in the future."
4,chachainLA,"I LOVE this app. The candy sort game works to ease my anxiety and keep my brain sharp in ways that really really works for me.  My only gripe is that after the most recent updates the game is super sluggish and slow when completing and going to the next level. (I‚Äôm on level 794/1500) and when it tries to roll to the next level it often gets hung up. The pieces, when moving from flask to flask, are also much less responsive. It feels as though it‚Äôs being weighed down by something. And the slower pace makes it much less enjoyable, for me, unfortunately."
3,AK14783,What is going on with 1.30.21 version? Candy sort is not ending when you finish it. It‚Äôs been lagging several recent versions actually
5,Lklogan,"Hi - ever since last update whenever I complete candy sort game, the final ball refuses to go into last slot. Game stalls every time. It eventually goes in. But it‚Äôs every time. Tried to send this msg on website help form but when I submit dialogue box just pops up with ‚Äúok‚Äù and never actually submits."
2,ItsTwin,"Not worth the download AT ALL, UNLESS, you are willing to pay for easily accessible info. Before you get any real insight you have to pass the Pay wall. If you don‚Äôt plan on paying, it‚Äôs a waste of time.   I wanted to try to archetype quiz and before I got any REAL results, I took a 72 question quiz to find out something I could have googled to be fair. And they gave me a 1 word answer and asked for my credit card for ‚Äòactual info‚Äô Maybe the mental games are worth it, but def super click bait to get you to buy into mental health and knowing yourself. I would have appreciated it more if it was decent info and gave MORE insight for paying. The free version is a tease but mayyyy be worth if paying. Not paying 59.99 to ‚ÄòFind out‚Äô though personally."
1,Anuoyedaf,"I purchased a subscription through Apple, and used the app. I cancelled February 2024. Now June 2024 they charged me $29.98, then $9.99 a week later but this time they charged directly through their website and not Apple. Make it make sense. And ya know, naturally it‚Äôs non refundable even though I‚Äôve never accessed their website directly. $29.98 isn‚Äôt even a price option advertised."
1,Simple user 0515,If you‚Äôre enjoying Candy Sort‚Ä¶.it has stopped displaying anything.  Just a blank screen;;)
5,I accidentally hit three stars,I love stuff to test my knowledge and to play stuff to use my brain.Impulse is so good it is absolutely amazing.It is also a lot of fun if you like games for your brain.It doesn‚Äôt just have stuff for your brain it also has stuff to see how much you have anxiety and etc.I think Impulse is amazing!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Marco Review God,"I love the app however I use both android and apple devices and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to sync between the 2. The app on android is much more watered down than the apple app as well.  This is actually my only issue, otherwise I love the app."
1,jkatsico,"Am I going insane? I switch to iPhone and all of a sudden, all apps are behind a huge pay wall, this app included. You only get 3 days of it. That is unacceptable. Can't wait to go back to android"

5,GossipbubbleYT,I am a YouTuber and my nerves are always shot and  I feel anxious!

1,Mekajayy,"I signed up for the subscription, I some how did a weekly subscription and was charged over 100.00 for not using the app. I didn‚Äôt even know for months until yesterday. Requested a refund and was denied.   I feel users should only be charge if they are active. Never again! We have to stop signing up for ‚ÄúFree Trials‚Äù it‚Äôs not really free when you forget to unsubscribe, stealing millions of dollars from Americans.   Speaking on all subscriptions based products!"
5,Jennys reviews,You can get a three day trail for free and it‚Äôs a very relaxing game to play.It also gives you quizzes if you have ADHD and you IQ.
5,Byrdstokes5969,This game is really helpin wit concentrating and paying attention even for my old a**
1,ODonbob,Tell people you have to pay for the app before they complete a 10 minute long test. Not cool and disingenuous
5,Njdjdjcmcmmmmmmmmm,Sooooooooooooooooooo fun
1,Eedeev,"Update: the developer just replied to my review and only solidified how little they care about users. The response had nothing to do with what I wrote. They copy/pasted a generic response to people who complain their free 3 day trial still isn‚Äôt full access to their app. Which is ridiculous, if you give people only 3 days, they still won‚Äôt allow people to truly experience the full app. Regardless, it is all nonsense when my review was all about how I could not even try the app because of their poor support and glitches. Sad and careless developers.   Did the whole questionnaire and then was told I need to sign up or 3 day trial. No problem, I‚Äôll do the trial and see if I like it. Signed up at night and was told it renews in what actually is 2 days since I wasn‚Äôt using it right away. Frustrating as I wish it would assure me 72hrs clearly before charging me. Then I wasn‚Äôt logged in and it wanted me to do the questionnaire again. I didn‚Äôt understand why and why I couldn‚Äôt login. Couldn‚Äôt get any help. Went to the developer website to ask but after writing and a message in the contact us form the send it button only came back with an error screen. So it wouldn‚Äôt send and no way to get help. So I emailed them the inquiry. It‚Äôs been over a week and no response. Can‚Äôt recommend a terrible experience like this."
3,INQE,"I literally just downloaded this app and started the games and questions and BAM! 1 game in and I get a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù opportunity to get the app for $28.99 for the year as opposed to $39.99 which is NOT the 92%off I was offered.  Fine whatever, par for the course with apps immediately trying to get money from you.  Well then I go to do a questionnaire, mind you I just signed up so I‚Äôm supposed to be  free 3-day trial!  So I complete the 72 questions and it generates the report and BAM! Immediately my access to the report is blocked behind another paywall!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°!!  So I go ahead and let myself get bullied into a paid subscription and it completely eradicates my ‚Äúfree 3-day trial‚Äù!!  So I got a 3 minute trial before I was bombarded with subscription demands!  I subscribed for one week and I IMMEDIATELY cancelled my subscription so it won‚Äôt renew.  I would have paid for this app, IN FULL, if I had been given the decency of upfront information and not lied to and teased with a carrot on a stick that lured me into this app.  So as much as I think this is probably a brilliant app, they‚Äôve lost me because now I feel strong armed and mislead and have no interest in giving any more of my money to a company who feigns a feee trial only to block your access to everything by forcing a subscription! Forget it!"
1,Mr hero999,So I downloaded this app cause brain it ain‚Äôt bad but I want it to get better cause why not so I downloaded this app got through everything and then I gotta pay to use this app‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so you telling me there‚Äôs free Spotify and free duolingo and free whatever but this app isn‚Äôt free WHY! Anyways if a developer sees this just put a free version like duolingo please thank you
5,83tr3y,This 10000% helps with your brain iq
2,Jewlz7,"It gives u 3 days to play with it and decide whether u want to pay $7 a week or $30 a year. Hmmm  It won‚Äôt even give u the results of a test it gives u unless u agree pay. This is the 1st day, first test‚Ä¶ wth?   Deleting this right now!"
1,el tito 123,This app scams you I canceled my subscription it was a free trial and now it wants to charge me 31.00 for it that‚Äôs crazy bc it was supposed to be a FREE TRIAL THIS IS SO WRONG OF THEM and that‚Äôs falls advertising I‚Äôm suing bc of them I‚Äôm not able to use my Apple Store
1,gfffddsssssszd,Absolutely a scam it never said 6.99 WEEKLY anywhere and I have had the app since December and only realized i was getting charged today because this 6.99 app was billed with another  15.99 MAX app and I noticed a 22.98 charge. They are so slick and sneaky to charge a small amount so we don‚Äôt even realize it but I found out today and I want a refund!! This is complete robbery!! 5 months of taking advantage of me. Give my money back!!
1,yogi the real one,So I was playing impulse and it gave me a huge discount for my tasks completed. I swear it said 22.99 for year but it looks like it charged me regular price. This will stay a one star until I receive a response. Thank you
5,Nyjae509,A good schools game that can help your students understand and learn in a fun way.Me personally recommend this app for your kids and students if I were you I would go and download the app stop going to the reviews when you see the how about download the game first .I promise you will not regret it.5 stars highly recommend !!!!!! THX and have a great day ü§©ü§ì.
1,Maykitty1989,"This is a scam to still your money, I downloaded and now THERE IS NO cancel buttom in apple store or under my subscription. When download I kept going without a username, so now I've been charged and no way to cancel, so Ive been robbed $6,99/week. I want cancel this app!"
5,GayeSusan,"I liked this because it is fast and fun but it makes me use my brain quicker. Also, eye and.hand coordination"
1,Report of Consumer,"This application is a complete SCAM! Its $6.99 plus tax per week, which there is no disclaimer that states this information. I have read every term and condition from all websites.   Before the computerized human who comments on everyone post with the same information, I will inform you that I did not click or choose to have this feature. You stated that if the consumer watches the free advertisement feature they won‚Äôt have to pay extra. Also FALSE.   If you think you eliminated by anxiety, you have absolutely caused me to mentally be distraught over this app.   I will be taking the creator and Apple to small claims court.    Please advise any comment back will be screenshotted and recorded for quality and assurance purposes.   Total owed $296.79"
5,Yomamaqwrt,"I‚Äôve spent more on brand new video games that collect dust on my entertainment shelves. $49.99 might have been the purchase of 2024. My screen time on every other app has plummeted. Instead of watching mindless (and endless) TikToks/reels/shorts, I can spend 4 hours on the weekend playing ENGAGING games. Then I opened TikTok and resumed my other addictions ü§£. Either way, great alternative to mobile games and very engaging, challenging games."
4,Maddie Anderson @I‚ô•Ô∏èroblox,This app I recommend. You can get 92 percent off and it still works even if you don‚Äôt pay. I didn‚Äôt pay and I still get good service and experience. I wish though that you didn‚Äôt have to pay for full experience   Byeee @swifties
2,Yogiscout,Give us back the previous version - this one force quits the game. Not good. Great game - obviously bad qc on the game update to 1.30.13.  iPhone 15 Pro Max iOS 17.4.1 Impulse v1.30.13
1,Joe Manzi,Decent app. Not worth the price. Advertised $28.99 for yearly plan. Then charged me $45.71. Not sure why I was charged an additional 58% over what was advertised.
1,TINKER 1970,"My cousin introduced me to Impulse. She plays the Crossword game and asked for help when she couldn'f figure out a word. I must say, for a mental health app, it is a great gaming experience. I quite enjoyed the variety of games and the challlenges they bring. I decided I wanted it myself, so I looked for it in the app store, installed it, and paid the lifetime option - only to find that the game is VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR ANDROID!!! Not only that, THE VERY GAME WHICH DREW ME TO THE APP ISN'T IN THE ANDROID VERSION!!! WHAT??? Same GMRD Apps Limited, 2 different experiences, layouts, and options? How is that OK? It's annoying and demeaning to pay the SAME AMOUNT FOR SOMETHING AND GET A SUB PAR EXPERIENCE. This ""BUG"" that must be fixed."
5,Jovanggfthfghjhgfryhjh,"Excellent memory, exercise game!!!"
2,bowerbirdart,"I have been enjoying playing these games but something frustrating has happened.  While playing on about Level 480/1180 in the Robotic Flows game it switched from challenging games to lower level games.  I thought that the premise was to CHALLENGE the brain not make it frustratingly less challenging.  Also, I have run across many glitches that made it difficult to advance in the game because even when I was playing the game correctly it would not recognize a part that I had completed.  Is this going to happen with every game that I play?  It also happens with the Candy Sorting game.  Instead of progressively getting more and more challenging it reverts back to easy games.  I wish I wouldn't have purchased this game."
5,Deez mother,Xhdgdh
5,g00nii,Good shi
3,Meadowverde,"Yes, the app is compelling and enjoyable. But ‚Ä¶ over and over again, no matter how well you do, the games put you in the 0 percentile. or one percentile, which is just as bad. Even when your time is decent and you score 95-100% accuracy. It‚Äôs obviously inaccurate, annoying and demoralizing. For this I‚Äôm paying money?"
5,Sugar_Cosby,Itssa cool app @sugar_cosby all social media platforms‚Ä¶ if you have locs and in Atl hmu @crazysweetlocs everywhere
4,jenw075,It has some glitches. Once I got to around 800-900 level it continues to not turn each finished game green. I have to go back again snd replay. Happens about every three games.   Can we get some more word search games?   Thank you!
5,3Mycastle3,Super amazing games
5,Ponderosagrrl,I like the way this is laid out.  I‚Äôve tried a few other sites and this one is my favorite.  I have not been using it for long and would really like it if it became available for Android.
1,01kai01,All these 5 star reviews are bots and having to pay $49.99 to remove adds for EACH game separately is actually insane. Don‚Äôt install.
1,VegetarianVirgo,I signed up with the free 3-day trial. It was very limited and wouldn‚Äôt give me the full results to my quizzes unless I skipped the free trial and paid right then.  It would say what type I am but if I wanted the description I had to pay.  I can‚Äôt review the full app; it‚Äôs $6.99/week or $28.99/year.
5,md)ndsnens)e)hd7nr77dhe,Impulse is a good game because you have to solve brain games and it helped me focus on tasks.Si I would say download it.
5,mokkamomma,This is a fun app to help pass the time and it‚Äôs also helping my brain.Its a Win/Win!!
5,isonthaveanothernickname,Awesome!! Replace scrolling with this app!!
3,BrattyB00,"Said it would cost me $28.67 for a year subscription with a 90% discount. I caved and purchased it, and they charged me $38.67. I want my $10 back!! Sneaky punks!! You can‚Äôt just overcharge people."
2,Kk32619,This app was pretty cool until I took a test and wanted to see my results so I clicked on free trial UNAWARE that it would charge my account multiple times of the day everyday $28.99 I even cancelled my subscription now apple won‚Äôt let me download any apps. I would rate a 0 but that‚Äôs not possible
2,Scottydoesntknow609,"I actually give this 4 stars. I feel like someone who is genuinely interested in it would see what the bad reviews say. Especially when there‚Äôs not any, then most people read each of them and only a few of the good. It keeps your attention and is engineered to make you strive for better. Like ull make a simple mistake in a round. then, after you just think to yourself. ‚ÄúAhh ok, gotcha. If I did it again, no way I‚Äôd miss that.‚Äù Maybe you go back and u do, Mayb you don‚Äôt. The point is, it exercised ur brain to force it beyond your baseline comfort of retaining information and pushing to remember more than previously. The only downside is adds. Bunch and they‚Äôre kinda long. If u have an android it‚Äôs faster to go to the screen of all u apps open, tap which app icon. Then hit app info, close previous impulse tab, finally go back to your app info page and hit open in the bottom left.  All that is faster than the add."
3,Dmilsg,"The games are really fun but the ADS are OVER KILL. If you play any of the games after your daily brain games, you have to watch a very long ad before and in between each level and some of the levels you can do in a few seconds. On top of that you have to watch the ad play, then a second part to the ad which is another 5 seconds, then the app store pops up. You have to exit out of all that. Don‚Äôt want the ads just pay $6.99 per week (28.00 a month) ?! Or buy it for 50.00 that‚Äôs just steep. I would pay a monthly fee of $6.99 for no ads but 6.99 a week no way. I can just find something else to do."
5,HaRneKK,interesting
1,Secunded,I had so much fun with these games but I was locked out and lost all my progress. It‚Äôs pretty annoying to have to go back and start at the beginning especially as you wonder will I be locked out again as I make significant progress.Looking around for another Brain app  I have written to the company asking for refund but no response- money back or restore my progress olease.

1,Baknocknock,"I was seriously considering subscribing, but wanted the full 3 days to test out the features.  I noticed when I signed up for the free trial, even though I picked the 6.99 weekly option, my card was immediately charged 32.99. I‚Äôm crossing my fingers that will be reversed since I cancelled, but we shall see. Still, why 32.99 and not 6.99? That‚Äôs just weird math no matter how you look at it.  But it gets worse.  I started a 20 min IQ test, and at the end, it wouldn‚Äôt let me see my results unless I permanently subscribed.  Seriously? That‚Äôs not a free trial at all! You already put a hold on my card, I‚Äôll likely get distracted in three days and forget to cancel anyway, why hold my results hostage?? It made me angry enough that I don‚Äôt care to know whether it‚Äôs a good app or not, I‚Äôm cancelling. I‚Äôm so mad that I wasted 20 minutes! It wasn‚Äôt enough to try out the features to know if I want to subscribe so I‚Äôm certainly not doing that, but unless I do subscribe, you just wasted my time. So if I do subscribe, I can see my results‚Äîbig whoop‚Äî but then what if I hate the app? Too late, my money is gone. I would rather waste 20 minutes than 30 or so bucks. It‚Äôs marketing manipulation at its worst."

1,MrsAlexH,"I‚Äôm disappointed that I was offered a free 1 year trial and then charged $31.42 for canceling. Apparently you get charged for canceling greater than 24 hours of the trial expiration. I canceled because I knew I‚Äôd forget to next year. No other app has charged me for canceling. I only wanted to try it because it was ‚Äúfree.‚Äù That was not completely truthful. This was distasteful on the part of Impulse. I thought this app would be a fun FREE way to exercise my brain but now I‚Äôm even more stressed out I was charged for playing games like simple addition and subtraction. I would never recommend this app to anyone simply for the Subscription Terms, which btw you don‚Äôt see until after you‚Äôve done the ‚Äúfree‚Äù subscription by looking at the very bottom of your account details. I true mindf."

1,Anticap1,"Awesome game with an offensive number of ads, a big f u to anybody who doesn‚Äôt always have the money to pay up. Peak Capitalist scum disgusts me"
2,Hoague1808,The app is fun but when they make you spin at the beginning for a freebie I got 90% off the total yearly amount and when it was billed it was big applied. I paid the full $28.99. The app is fun but it would be nicer if I got the discount I spun. üôÑ
1,eraseddesare,It‚Äôs not free you will pay weekly or yearly. You also lose the opportunity to make a one time purchase for the app for $49.99! Once you agree there is no 3 day free trial and now you are subscribed. Make sure to cancel in your settings! Now if you don‚Äôt mind throwing your money away this is a great app for you.
1,TleeMH,"As soon as I installed this app, I was notified of a pending charge to my bank account of $34.25.  I was under the impression this is a free app with the option to upgrade to remove ads (hence ‚Äúin game purchases‚Äù included in app description).  The pending charge better be released very soon since I have uninstalled the app.  I‚Äôm submitting a complaint to Apple.  This is the first time I‚Äôve had a bad experience with an app I downloaded from the store."
5,font maker review,I love this app.helps with everything it says and helps lots
1,lgv-0,"As the other 1 star reviews show, they allow the 3 day trial, but inside the app it pretends you never got it - and will ask you fork over the $7/week or $28.99/year.  So you start the trial, which tells you that you need to actually pay before you get to see things like tests. The trial is NOT a trial, and this is very clearly trying to abuse the Apple subscription system."
5,Vgsifecjwhasywjegs,10000/10
1,Michael Cornell,"if you are going to force me to pay for your ‚Äúbrain training app‚Äù why give me ads? also it said in one screen that the yearly membership is 39.99 yearly, and then when i opted for the free trial it gave me a temu lottery animation that gave me a (100% rigged) 92% discount which was 28.98 yearly???? clearly this app is just a money farm, and it tries to trick you into being addicted to it so you will hopefully keep using it and paying them more money!!! if you want to do better for yourself start by not looking at your phone and maybe take a walk"
1,Irt I,Numbers
1,Almostüòâ,"Every time you trying to take a test, the app won‚Äôt let you see the results unless you pay for it. When you try to do something else, it wants you to sign up for the subscription. The subscription doesn‚Äôt cover getting your results btw. That‚Äôs a separate charge. And while taking a test the app opened up my web browser several times and took me to a scam Amazon page trying to steal my information. Please don‚Äôt download this"
5,trevkv,Not bad
2,Thatonegirl113,"Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love all of the games they have on there. It really is a fun app! The only problem I have with this app is that it keeps on sending me to scam websites. I‚Äôm playing a game and all of a sudden I‚Äôm transported to some rip-off Amazon that says: ‚ÄúCongratulations! You are one of the ten lucky people who get the chance to win an iPad Pro! Just take this quiz and you‚Äôll have a chance to get it!‚Äù How do I get this to stop? It puts me outside of the app and into safari."
1,vsiskk kkdjisjk,"I subscribed for a free trial on November 2nd and they charged $28.99 on the same day even though the charge has to go through after the tree trial is done (which is a few days). For the reference, I cancelled free trial subscription 30 min after i downloaded it!!!!We called Apple the next day and they said it will take 30-60 days for their decision and only then if they approve we will get money back. The free trial supposedly to expire in the 5th but it expired on the same day not even 24 hours!!!! I am not going to forget about this and i‚Äôll make sure I follow up with this so I get my refund!"
2,Jashxaa,"I saw that many of the games are just games that you can download for free on the app store. Also for someone with anxiety, a lot of the questionnaires have a lot of questions that are irrelevant and you honestly do not need to know about yourself. By the way, no questionnaire can diagnose you with something, but give the most educated guess you can get."
1,AprylD29,Can‚Äôt even take the iq test without paying.  I‚Äôm a new Apple user and thinking I‚Äôll switch back to android.  Everything costs money and is sneaky and shady in this database for sure.  I‚Äôm pretty much over it.  I have been screwed over so many times I‚Äôm starting to lose track.  Thought Apple was more secure but I‚Äôve already dealt with a data breach and too many apps conning me into subscriptions then I can count.  Back to android I go lol.  Careful on having to pay.  Over at android we don‚Äôt have to pay for these types of apps.
5,Fortunate Father,I have played a lot of brain training games and this one is by far the best to date. Today is 10/28/23.
5,Linnyb66,Awesome!
5,DJPUCILLO,Fun and interesting. Always good to challenge yourself and keep your mind sharp. I would recommend this over watching a YouTube video or Instagram video to kill time.
5,bcfr buef bhrec,This was a very good game. When I had a Long day I‚Äôd come home and do these challenges. I love how you make them educational but fun at the same time. A lot of apps have educational stuff but not. This app I would totally recommend. That is why I give it five stars.THERE IS BARELY ANY ADDS!!
5,dgj24la,Absolute love the feeling of doing this consistently. I can feel these games declutter my brain. 10000/10
5,++Lisa 79++,I just got this game yesterday and I am having a lot of fun with it.Itd Great !!!
5,eitjtisqije,"I usually spend a lot of time scrolling through Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok watching mind numbing videos for hours and wasting time, but after installing impulse it feels like a great transition from scrolling. It‚Äôs nice to keep on doing better at games and seeing progress instead of not gaining anything after scrolling. Although I don‚Äôt spend as much time as I should should off my phone, impulse is a great distraction that feels beneficial."
1,okiehel,I downloaded the app and signed up for the 3-day trial with the understanding that I had 3 days to cancel. This was at 7:47pm on the 4th. I was charged $39.99 at 12:30am on the 6th. That‚Äôs ridiculous! I should have had the entire day of the 6th to cancel it. Instead I was charged after less than 28 hours. Jerks!
5,Sfahnisha,Such an engaging amazing program.  I expect amazing results.
1,Aunt Moore,"This company advertises 92% off for the App on a yearly billing cycle of under $25. When I was charged, the amount was much higher at $39.17‚Ä¶.watch out for the very, fine print."
1,TinaG423,"I signed up for the trial and was charged $43.44 on the same day. I‚Äôve tried disputing it with apple and they‚Äôve denied me. So, almost $50 spent on something I do not want.  UPDATE to their response: I signed up for the FREE TRIAL. On my account it shows Free Trial and on the same day $43.44 charge. I did not ok that charge. I‚Äôve emailed them several times and get no response. This app is a rip off."
1,screw xfinity 1999,Useless and stupid and expensive and not worth it
1,Jacobm2010,"I like the app and the games, but i join under a free 3 day trial which if i liked the app fully intended to pay for a lifetime subscription. I get through a session and take a ADHD quiz for 10 minutes and get paywalled for a yearly subscription.   What is this? I‚Äôm almost unreasonably disgusted but the camp and kitchiness of the ads and how they were presented as a dice game and you get wow 92% off of a yearly subscription which equals $28.99. In what world would you charge $350 for a yearly subscription when the standard lifetime subscription is $48. I just feel so sold to I‚Äôm like being super unreasonable but I‚Äôm mad. My night is ruined."

4,Jazzyalex,Need to support multiple profiles. That‚Äôs the major reason I won‚Äôt buy subscription (plus few minor). Also would be nice  to support kids below age 13 (7-13)
3,Gorrrrrda,Charges  3-Day Free Trail then $6.99 per week  $39.99 paid annually YEARLY $49.99 one time payment LIFETIME
4,G suits is best,Fun to play. Love to playing. Never thought it was good.enjoy it
1,False Advertising 4,I just purchased this because it said it was 28.99 yearly for a limited time and it charged me 47.99!! That‚Äôs wayyyyy off. Not happy because I don‚Äôt even play games on my phone hardly ever.
2,Toto441986,It was charging me 7.99 weekly when I agreed it was supposed to be monthly! Was beyond mad! Then offer my 14.99 for a year! What a rip off to bad it‚Äôs a good app that steals your money if you‚Äôre not looking!
1,jbell4,"While under free trial I was in the app for about 2 minutes and what appeared to be part of the game, three gift boxes pop up (what I later learned offering discounts on pricing). I clicked on the boxes thinking it was part of the game and then was ‚Äúgiven‚Äù the discount and charged for a year subscription and my free trial was cancelled. I didn‚Äôt even realize what had happened. I thought I was still under a free trial. I immediately tried to request a refund from Apple but was told I didn‚Äôt qualify. I was charged $28.99 for an app while I was suppose to be under a free trial."
1,Breeniesweeney,"When I first downloaded the app I was offered a discount of 28.99 per year. Instead I was charged 49. When I look at my subscriptions, it says 28.99, but that‚Äôs a lie. I tried to contact the support email, but no one has ever addressed my issue. All the Apple support shows is how to change your subscription. I really wish I had never opened this thing because it‚Äôs not worth $50 for a year. Fix your crappy customer service! I‚Äôm working on getting a charge back from my credit card for the scam."
5,Fabstergabster,"This game is so much fun. I have ADHD and can‚Äôt just ‚Äúgo to sleep‚Äù like most people when night comes around. I have to keep it active right up until sleep calls. This game is great for keeping it engaged without endangering my sleep (like something TikTok or YouTube or Netflix would do). Plus, I feel like my brain is able to work a bit better when I‚Äôm on the job. Ill be curious to see how it works in the long-term for me."
5,Maggiex0May1028,Great way to take your mind off B.S of re focus yourself for yourself !
5,kmoney‚ù§Ô∏èü§§üòòü§™,Don‚Äôt be shy explore your IQ
5,Hokoyai,"with this app, I feel like I‚Äôve been able to pay attention to things more. I have an issue with not being able to focus and this app helps a lot I would definitely recommend this to other individuals that suffer from the same issue.10 out of 10."
1,dontsayitsfreeifitsnot,I‚Äôm giving 1 star due to being mislead into think it was a free app. You may download for free and do tests but to garner your results you have to pay a subscription to the app.
1,Fuglberries,"At the very beginning, before you even do the ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù part, you are given a little survey of what you want to do with the app and stuff like that. At the very end, after you‚Äôve done everything, they give you a subscription service to use the app. After it was free to download and after you completed the questionnaire on your personalizations. There isn‚Äôt even a free version. Like, I‚Äôm sorry I wanted to download a free app that could train my brain to help focus and be better. It‚Äôs so utterly stupid that they don‚Äôt even have a free version. Think about Spotify and their Premium Subscription. That‚Äôs fine, but locking EVERYTHING behind a big ol‚Äô monthly paywall is absolutely ridiculous."
1,aywamguy,"For taking as much money as they want to per week, you would think some decent spelling and use of English grammar would be a priority. When I see 4th grade spelling and language mistakes it calls to seriously question the legitimacy of the ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind these tests. Speaking of tests, all the tests are very leading, encouraging you to self diagnose a condition. It seems the creators prey on ignorance, naivety, and gullibility.  Finally. The methods in which they grind payment out of you reminds me of scam and spam callers impersonating Amazon and the IRS. Ridiculous games touting discounts and ‚Äúwinnings‚Äù are cheap and belittle the professionalism expected from a mental health app.  It‚Äôs a poorly designed app and I would seriously question any legitimacy to mental health, emotional health or awareness input they ‚Äúprovide‚Äù. Stay away."

5,Gizouli,This app is like a gym for your mind.with different game and puzzle you'll target every neural in your brain
5,SweetLilBaker,Slayyy
1,MatthewMud,"A collection of free tests you can find anywhere else online put behind arbitrary paywalls.    You can get a 3 day free trial, but it only lets you take the tests/quizzes- the results are then behind yet another paywall.    So the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial didn‚Äôt offer anything other than a small waste of time.   I think this for really stupid people that don‚Äôt know what they are doing with their life.    Can‚Äôt express enough at how frustrating the trial experience was after being shown possibly interesting quizzes in the ad, signing  up for the free trial that is supposed to be the same as the $6.99 tier access for 3 days- and then getting promoted to subscribe for $28.99 after every click‚Ä¶.   Nah, deleted."
5,SANDrockzz,Love the app.from Simple to intricate games to sharpen your mind and skill is really important and I‚Äôm loving this app
2,netterbetter1,Not challenging
1,TellinDaTruth9,"$49.99 to buy, or $29.99/yr, or $6.99/wk‚Ä¶ no thanks"
4,ü¶ãü´•ü´¢üòéü§ìü•∏,It is a good app.just a few recommendations i personally think it should be free because it only lets you do three things a day. Witch brings me to my next recommendation I do not like at all how you can only do a few things a day I think you should not have to pay for that I understand buying it in the App Store but paying to use it I just hate I also hate that with all apps it really disappointed me when I saw I had to pay to use it so I picked the free three day trial I will not be keeping the app so please I do not recommend it please don‚Äôt wast your money on this app also this is just my option you don‚Äôt have to agree with it but this is also recommending things to the creator and it also has a ton off adds really annoying adds I hate adds so if you agree just get a game with better reviews.
5,Sammers1971,I‚Äôm addicted to kick my own butt.  Lol.  I recommend.
4,Chicago melissa,"First game finding pairs not interesting The matching was 3rd grade level. I may be old , but not stupid.interesting  matching with world landmarks and more items to select from would make it better."
1,LeviticusIII,"After my first set of 3 games, I was offered a random choice of 3 prize boxes with varying discount percentages. Luck would have it, I selected the best discount at 92% off the subscription cost. On the following acceptance screen, I was given the choice to upgrade to the non-discounted yearly plan for $29.99 a year (I‚Äôm currently on 3-day free trial, followed by $6.99 weekly thereafter). The discounted price I had ‚Äúwon‚Äù was only reflected in the weekly price of $0.58/week (originally $6.99/week). When I clicked accept, there was no option to select the weekly discounted price. I could only proceed at the original, full price on the annual subscription. At a 92% discount, I should have been able to buy the lifetime subscription for only $4.59 since there were no stipulations or limitations to the discount on the prize screen.  This is false advertising just to get people to click so they can make $30. I guess they‚Äôre putting too much weight on the fact that we haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúbrain-trained‚Äù by their app yet, but this is basic math‚Ä¶ smh. I have screenshots to prove the false ad."
5,Gemma may Beaty,Best game I have ever played.amazing graphics and great for getting over stress.And NO ADSü•≥üíØpercent recommended.
1,Dannyhanboury,Misleading commercial to download this game
5,lolalyd,I‚Äôve just have downloaded this app and I‚Äôm already in love with this app get it for free and you can do it 5 mins a day 10 mins a day or 20!
3,MindfulMother,"I opted for the three day trial and ended subscription on day two, very early day two actually. Barely finishing day one, that‚Äôs how early. I canceled free trial before the time was up and low and behold- I was charged for a week anyway. Not cool! I was NOT  ready to commit to any subscription at the time and still am not. If you, the developer, says you are allowing a free trial and one cancels before said time, then your word is everything. Your promise of a free trial should be granted. Trust broken. It‚Äôs not right.  The subscription now says it ends on 6/12/23- we shall see. I would really appreciate my money back. I will be deleting the application and will not be getting at subscription in the future like I had planned to do."
4,Riley_246810@letsgo,"This is game super fun and challenging. My goal was to get this app and keep my brain sharp, learn more, and get faster of doing different challenges.It worked I have been playing for only a couple days and it‚Äôs awesome.I would recommend it to anyone who is bored or wants a challenge every now and than.There is many different games  and tests you may do.Get Impulse the best game in the universe a 5 star game for anyone and everyone."

1,consuela88,"It has games on it that are already free in other apps(wordle, sorting games, memory etc) If you enjoy those and want to pay $7 a week to play them, then this is the app for you‚Ä¶Also.. the free trial isnt a free trial. I wasted 20 minutes on an IQ test only to find out I had to pay $5 or $28.99 to see results‚Ä¶..I  don‚Äôt mind paying for apps that I know Ill use, because I understand everything can‚Äôt be free. However,  if you're going to offer a free trial, then it needs to be free. I‚Äôm not spending $28.99 on an App without trying it first."
5,Warren Speaks Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆ255,"Hey! I have Combined ADHD, the worst kind, and this really helped. I could feel it working within the first, like, 10 minutes. And it‚Äôs not one of THOSE games, either, like the ones where you have to pay, like 15$ (12.11¬£) for 5 games but it‚Äôs mainly free. You can also tell this isn‚Äôt just to make money. They actually put effort into this to help people with ADHD and Anxiety. This is a great game! Thank you so much!!"
5,üôÑCharlieüôÑ,"I only have one bad reason about this,but I love this game.Love the daily games.Love the games that it has.But there‚Äôs only some games to play,that doesn‚Äôt make me mad,but all the other games needs to be unlocked to be played.I wish there‚Äôs more games that are free.But overall this game is good."
1,Whdihfbd,"Only way for me to take a test I downloaded the app for was to get a $6.99 subscription so I did it then took the test and the only way to see the results were for a premium subscription which was $29.99! I cancel my subscription and I‚Äôm still charged the $29.99 and the $6.99, I only had the app downloaded for maybe 5 minutes and immediately deleted it, how am I spending $37. Maybe I‚Äôm at fault but it said I wouldn‚Äôt be charged until the end which wasn‚Äôt true."
1,Emersonandsophie,"Loved the idea of this app and most of the games despite the ads.  BUT when you throw completely inappropriate ads in that are insinuating pedophilia, it‚Äôs time to say good bye. Beware of the ads especially if you‚Äôre allowing your kids to play this app."
3,Mamasweeta,"i have the free trial, which by the way, three days is nothing when you want people to pay $7 EACH week. but for your three day period, you don‚Äôt even get full access to all of the premium offers which is literally what the trial is for. the games are fun i guess but very laggy, takes a few tries to do whatever move you want to make. it‚Äôs nice how you can skip the ads quicker than other apps but again, i‚Äôm not going to pay for something weekly just for an app i don‚Äôt even know if i like. if it was charged monthly or $2-$3 a week. i can work for 8 hours for $11.50 and only get paid $27 with taxes and i‚Äôm not going to waste 7/27 dollars.. so all in all, free trial isn‚Äôt worth it, the app can really get on your nerves all too easily. i have nothing to do in this life but this app gave me an excuse to be extra ig so thanks"

Then they tell you to cancel subscription 24 hours before the free trial is over by canceling via Apple ID account settings.   However, the app doesn‚Äôt appear till it starts charging you, so you CAN‚ÄôT cancel the free trial.   Their customer support page is bogus, you can write a message, but you can‚Äôt send it.

3,dearwandering,"As far as brain training goes, this is fine; but it‚Äôs not going to wow you. I ended up trying it because I got coupon code for 90% off a year; but I‚Äôm pretty sure I won‚Äôt finish a year. Why? It‚Äôs in the little things. There are graphics make games hard to comprehend and English wording in English learning apps that is either over precise or incredibly vague and repetitive.  It lacks a wholesome, finished, creative, and bright approach. The IQ tests are not broached properly for people with neurodiversity. The personality tests just fail in a lack to explain where they come from, what they mean, and why they matter. Over all, it just fails impress. For someone who actually is looking to gain minimal logic skills and isn‚Äôt at a 95% fluency rate in English‚Ä¶maybe it will help. But for me, it just falls short."

1,BrainTeaser696789042/345))45,Saw the app on instagram and thought id try it. They get you through the data collection process and then they need a credit card! Why not just charge a flat rate to download the game? Why so deceptive about Download for free and then in app purchases. I would have been happy with ads in order to play the game just to try before i buy too.   3 Thumbs down for this scam!

1,Kovudhino,"I feel swindled. I played the first few games and then had the opportunity to pick a box with varrying discounts for the annual subscription. I ended up choosing the box that was 92% off. This changed the price from 6.99/month to .56/month (as advertised) They said they would charge the year up front, which is fine because it was a good deal. I was expecting a charge of $6.72 total. This would be .56 a month, multiplied by 12 months. Imagine my surprise when they charged me $28.99. Displeased..."
1,WickedRaptor,"Yeah I‚Äôm deleting this after not even an hour having it. The amount of times that they shoved their subscription service in my face was enough to piss me off and realize their greed, so I‚Äôm deleting it!   Maybe don‚Äôt be so greedy and about money and people might actually be willing to pay a little bit for what could be a fun experience if it wasn‚Äôt shoved in their face the minute you get in and try to test it out. Bye bye! You‚Äôre just like every fake liar pay to win app in the App Store! Hope people get wise and shut you down!"

5,therealNotKim,"The price tag is a little steep unless you do a yearly (free trial>play a few games>get an offer code; abt $29 for a year) I enjoy the games, even though most are the ones you probably already have on your phone. Difference it‚Äôs in one place and you get analysis scores to see how you do against others.  My favorite part though is the IQ, personality, emotional maturity etc, quizzes they offer. Detailed reports and comparisons you usually have to subscribe for or go through a ton of ads and spam emails to read through.  Pretty fun and interesting; I think it‚Äôs worth checking out!"

5,Mizu787,"This is my favorite brain training app! It has so many different games that increase in difficulty as you play, and it has daily goals to complete. It‚Äôs easy to use and understand, and it gives my brain decent workout :)  I just wish I could share it with my mom, but she used an android and this app is not (hopefully *yet*) available for Android."
1,Womaninred80,"I enjoy the games so much that I decided to upgrade to PRO account, but instead of being charged $6.99 once every two weeks or $13.98 per month, they have thrown in an extra $6.99 charge. Since September, I have been charged $6.99 TWICE and two weeks later, charged the regular $6.99. This month - November - he fee increased to $7.41 and I was billed twice. This practice is very deceptive, and I am requesting a refund for every extra payment charged to my account, which totals $21.49. Thank you in advance."
1,WASTEOFMONEYDONTBUY,"I didn‚Äôt even make an account but I downloaded the app and it asked me questions about age, gender, intention etc but never an email, or phone number, or name, or even a username / passwords. It then asked me if I wanted to pay for it or do a free trial. I selected ‚Äúfree trail‚Äù and when I verified my selection I was charged $50. I suppose that‚Äôs what I get for linking my card to my phone. I don‚Äôt know how I will tell them to refund me bc there was no account or subscription made when I paid so I don‚Äôt know how to prove my payment. I didn‚Äôt even get a receipt or proof of purchase. There‚Äôs no number or online to support to reach out to so hopefully I can find some way to contact them and show them my bank statement."
3,Robert Estyd,It‚Äôs a really good brain app but I feel they‚Äôre really milking the cost too much (like a lot). $6 plus per week is too much that‚Äôs like $288 per year which is insane for an app you could train your brain skills ability on YouTube and other apps for free sure it won‚Äôt be as good but still better than spending that much for  most average people. this should be like at most $10 per month.

I use it daily, often multiple times."

1,MushyMushr00m,"I downloaded, used, and deleted the app within 5-10 minutes. It is simply a composition of games that you can find online for free or even in other apps that do not bombard you with constant ads. The moment you reach the connect the dots game you are being shown an add every time you complete one. So in only 10 dot games I was at least shown 8 ads. I do not know the real use of the app in the long term, but if you are looking forward to paying 4.99 to remove the adds (apart from the yearly subscription which you can pay as low as 24.98$) then this is your app! I give it a 1 stars because I couldn‚Äôt even notice any change so it didn‚Äôt convince me to even pay to take out the ads. I could compare this to those badly designed games that are featured everywhere because of how much money they make in ads and on the low paying transactions to help the user but we all know they are trash."
1,38372!:&,"This app is easily replaceable with any dollar store brain training game, or functional maths text book.

5,daidai0024,I never post reviews I might have posted like two or three in the last 15 years of using any kind of application on here but this one‚Äôs pretty cool only thing is you have to play to make certain things to make others free even though you might want to jump to them but it‚Äôs a good idea that you don‚Äôt jump to them because the other games you‚Äôre going to play are going to make those games worth playing. Also if you‚Äôre trying to play this game while drinking it is so much more fun.Probably not the greatest review but it‚Äôs definitely an honest one and I would recommend this to anyone.
2,nippypaws4,I got the app because I saw adds on TikTok saying to take free test to test my mental health but when I tried to get the results it wanted me to pay 12.99 per month absolutely ridiculous.

Unless your 100% certain then don‚Äôt purchase because apparently the 3 day free trial really isn‚Äôt free!

5,MamaG222,"It‚Äôs fun and challenging. It is exactly what I was looking for. I did purchase the lifetime for $39.99 one time fee, but you have to pay for quality stuff.

4,Applevier,"It seems to be good when developers update their creation to keep it at its best but too much is not good. Getting updates every other week takes the fun out of using the app, especially when we don‚Äôt see the real performance improvements. For example, some games require input. I‚Äôve lost precious time because there was no keypad to input my responses. The app was timing me but I could not respond. Those issues are not being addressed in the updates.now you have something to work with. I have the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù subscription."

1,Gigi_mama16,The app said 92% off of a lifetime amount (never to pay again) that original amount was $49.99. $44.07 is NOT 92% off. I would like my money back from them. That is bad business. Backstory after reading reviews and how eager this app company attempted to make it right I decided to give it a try. Loved it! I was doing the 3 day free trial. Then the free trial went to a screen with different prices (during the free trial) after remembering the reviews how it has helped them AND the app offered a one time 92% off of $49.99. This morning I looked at my transactions I was bambozzled. I‚Äôm guessing it was $39 or $40 THAT is NOT 92% off. Please do NOT get tricked like I did. I would like my money back!!!!!  To add‚Ä¶ The app had me cancel my free trial since I paid for the 92% off lifetime fee!
5,Jenntouchette,A better choice than my usual habits that lead to brain deading myself with Facebook and tik too and certainly far more beneficial to me than shopping on Amazon because they left me stuff on my aforementioned Facebook‚Ä¶ the endless loop!!  so yes! Well worth it and I‚Äôm spending much less money now ‚Ä¶ but the good news is that I have people that check on me‚Ä¶ like the Amazon man got worried he had less packages ‚Ä¶ so yeah. Endless benefits and it‚Äôs fun üòÄ

1,Strong girl number 1,Ads are horrific way to many ads game was designed for ads not to play after every game there‚Äôs a ad it‚Äôs ridiculous and there not short either 30 sec at the least the game takes less time to play.

1,gummypuke,"For the lack of original content, the literal annual $30 fee is astronomical. But, if you don‚Äôt pay the fee this app is completely useless. You are watching 15-20 second ads after every single problem or 2-3 second game, sometimes with 4-5 15-20 second ads back to back. It does not give you any features about your progress and the work behind problems unless you pay. Not worth the time, or the money."
5,!!...vRa...!!,I don‚Äôt pay for any part over it (although many benefits do come with paying) and I still have a good experience with the app. I find all of the games really fun and it‚Äôs perfect for anyone ages 13+. 100% recommend this app because my memory has got 10 times better!

5,The Local 1,"I would absolutely recommend this application to those desiring healthy mental growth. It combines active problem solving with rational and intuitive troubleshooting. It also generously includes mindfulness and teaches patience, while fastening in a plethora of creativity, all while progressively, yet subtly, strengthening your memorization, focus, and even enhancing your quick response cognitive thinking and practicality. Ironically, you may even *forget* that your effortlessly sharpening your receptors, while gently re-wiring your pre-frontal cortex, cerebrum, cerebellum, and many other parts of the always analyzing,  complex, and powerful organ we call, our Brain.üß† Impulse is extremely interesting yet simple enough to want to practice daily. I like that it not only grabs, but it keeps your attention very well throughout each lesson. Also a plus, I enjoy how the training is fun as well as challenging.ü§ù Entertaining even.üëåüèº A peaceful, productive, and practical way to improve or enhance your short and long term memory. On a scale of 1-10, I‚Äôd give it a solid 23.14159."

1,Billybob1238796,I was given the option to sign up for a (lifetime) membership for 39.99 which I was billed for. Then on top of that they started billing me 6.99 per week for a premium subscription! I already paid for a lifetime membership! Then I go to the App Store to check my subscription and there is no option for a lifetime at all and I‚Äôm signed up for 6.99 per week. They stole 40 dollars from me.
1,Bcart01v,"At the time of this review, the full version of this app is 6.99 PER WEEK. That‚Äôs almost $30 per week, which you could use for HBO Max, or Netflix, or Hulu. You cold even get a cable provider like Philo for the cost of this.    Even World of Warcraft, which probably takes a lot more manpower to develop and maintain is cheaper than this, and people trough fits about their pricing on release. This is simply way overpriced."
2,Avery McClellars,"I thought this app was so fun I paid 39.99 for a lifetime subscription.   However, even after doing this, I continued to be charged 6.99 a week!!!!!   I had to completely unsubscribe (forgoing my lifetime membership I paid for) just to get the charges to stop.   I‚Äôve got a refund request pending with Apple, but still a hassle."

1,Claireh703,"I downloaded this and signed up for the free 3-day trial and was able to cancel it in time to not be charged (unlike other people who have written reviews although some sound like user error). The activities are fine albeit some are very similar to each other. When the free trial ended, you can continue with the challenges but with an advert between each one - as the activities are very short, I‚Äôd guess that 50% of your time is adverts and not worth it.   My issue came when, after really enjoying a game called Towers of Hanoi and getting to a certain level, it said I needed to have a subscription to unlock further levels and offered a 3-day free trial. So I clicked on it presuming it was a separate trial but it charged me immediately ($10.79) when it should have either not offered the trial or had informed me that I wasn‚Äôt eligible and let me decide. I believe they purposely mislead to charge you. I‚Äôve asked for a refund (no response but early days) but wanted to also make sure no one else falls for it and gets wrongly charged.  The brain challenge is fine, the towers of Hanoi game is good but I imagine there are similar apps that are at least as good if not better but are more trustworthy.  In response to their generic response... As explained, I understand the subscription and how it works. My issue is that they are untrustworthy and purposefully mislead. And providing an email to send feedback is a PR stunt as I emailed that address with no response prior to leaving this review"

Sometimes it‚Äôs really annoying but I‚Äôm gonna stop typing about that game because I already wrote something about them. Anyways, if you are paying $6.99 a month, which btw is almost $84.00 per year. That‚Äôs a waste of money. Also it‚Äôs a scam."
