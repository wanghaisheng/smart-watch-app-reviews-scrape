5,Elykahn,"I have been absolutely loving this app, from the beginning the tone and language used is welcoming, warm, supportive and encouraging. I am a designer myself and I find the majority of apps are functional but devoid of character and this app maintains the ease of use (and even facilitates it) with a lot of character that makes reporting my feelings fun even when I’m not feeling like anything would be fun, the playfulness and abstraction in no way takes away from the experience and the human descriptions in the videos are so calm and purely helpful that they are not threatening the way self-improvement videos can be. They don’t make me feel bad for not having done a suggestion, just optimistic that I can see benefits from trying it.  My main point of improvement is that I have input a sizable number of check-ins on my iPad and others on my iPhone and although the two apps appear to be sharing the same identifier they don’t compile the data to get the full picture and that would be a huge improvement for me since I can’t easily compare the times that I am using one or the other. I looked for a way to export my data and import it to the other device(the long route) but I didn’t find anything, ultimately the best solution would be automatic sync. Keep up the great work!"
4,chocosprinkles,"my therapist recommended my girlfriend and i try using this app to improve our communication, and it’s done wonders! it’s expanded my vocabulary when it comes to describing my emotions, and made it much easier to communicate to her and to others how i’m feeling. it’s been a great tool for me in my mental health journey.   i was disappointed to see the addition of AI to an app i use to journal my emotions and inner thoughts. i don’t like the idea that my private thoughts might be used to train the AI, and it feels unnecessary in an app like this. i understand the intention is to help people gain insight into why they’re feeling a certain way, however it feels like users are expected to take mental health advice from or confide in a robot with no mental health training. it feels impersonal to me, and saddened me to see this feature on an app i use daily.   i would have loved to see these resources used to add other useful features; more to the incredibly helpful “tools” section of the app, an option to enter custom emotions with descriptions, or a quiz of some kind that can be taken to help identify the correct emotion word one can attribute to any given moment, to name a few. the AI might be great for some, but personally, it caused me to lose faith in the app and made me sad when i feel like there could be more helpful features added with the resources used to add an unnecessary AI."
5,Brian Rosenzweig,"Over the past few months I’ve been trying to understand myself on a deeper level. I lost my way and with a bunch of personal stuff, I found myself burying my emotions in numbing and medicating behavior (not substances but other means). Now that I finally stopped, every emotion is coming out at once and for awhile, I had no idea how to deal with them. It developed into a deep sadness and I had no idea what to do. My therapist recommended this app to me and after trying it, it’s made my life much better. First off, it’s free. You never see a free app like this because of the usual paywalls and subscriptions. Second, it gives me a chance to consider what emotion(s) I’m feeling and helps me talk it out. Going deeper with it gives me choices and chances to tell myself how to feel better and what to do to soothe any nerves or negative emotions. I’ve been using this app for over 40 days straight and it’s definitely helped me through rough times, especially with it being finals season. Thank you for this app. It will help people more than you would think possible. I think everyone should use it! Only complaint is the exercise and sleep measurement feature but I can easily try and fix that. I’m sure it works if I pick the right options."
5,Rylee_Natalie,"I love love this app. I share it with my friends and family. I love the ease - 4 choices to start, definitions of each emotion, and minimal typing the whole way. Unless you want to type a description of your moment, all aspects that are tracked are pre labeled buttons like “home” “mom” and “resting.” Those buttons are customizable and you can delete ones that dont apply to you. Navigating the emotion page is so user friendly, hope it doesnt change. I also appreciate how you dont need to log certain things like what you were doing, or how much exercise you had. The exercise log is very discreet for those of us who are sensitive to even small pressures to work out.   My only suggestion is to be able to go back and edit the time of day an entry is. Sometimes when I am working, I want to log my emotions. I cant because Im not allowed to have my phone on me, but I want to be able to log it after work and then edit the time so it reflects when that emotion happened. I think that same idea could be helpful in a variety of situations, like not wanting to make an entry around certain people, not realizing how you were feeling until later, etc"
4,Bookreader216,"I am autistic and can struggle with labeling emotions in the moment, so this is a good way to center myself with that. However, I feel like there should be an option for a secondary emotion that you can add if there is one or if a feeling is more complex. Like if you’re feeling content and accepted in a moment and at the same time sad for all the time you didn’t get that. Or relaxed and unfocused in the moment and having a waxing and waning anxiety about the fact that that will come back to haunt you, but deciding not to care. Feelings are often more than one thing and only by taking in the whole picture can you get a full understanding of them. Heck, even with the options that are there, the fact that some form of grief isn’t an option is kinda wild even though that is it’s own thing? Or that there’s a humiliated option but not an embarrassed one? Or even like infatuated, flirty, flattered, romantic, or aroused, which is a spectrum of emotion that could technically fall under “compassionate” or “ecstatic” or something like that, but are also their own thing? Overall I think is this a fantastic starting point and I hope in the future they build in more features to capture a fuller range of the human emotional experience, creating a more precise tool for the people who use it."
3,Newtonswdc,"No journaling app is complete without an export feature that sends our text entry data to a standard format like PDF, TXT or RTF. ** ** Because all our notes, epiphanies, realizations, etc, are stored on the DEVICE and not on their servers if something happens to the device or to the app, we’re out of luck and all our notes may DISAPPEAR. What’s a worse way to make a person feel lost, confused, and miserable than to realize an entire year’s worth of journal entries is GONE FOREVER because they dropped their phone or the app crashed unexpectedly? ** In fact, just now I was leaving a review through the app and the app FROZE on me. Thankfully no other data was lost this time but I think I’m making my point. ** I’m not saying the developers should find a way to store all the photos and audio recordings, that would be too cumbersome, just a way to store the date and time and all the notes we write for each entry and export that to a standard format like PDF, TEXT, and/or RTF. ** We should have multiple means of export like: Phone drive, email, Dropbox, etc. ** It would also be nice to include a feature that allows the ability to sync the data among multiple devices on a single Apple ID. I would be willing to pay extra for those export & sync features. ** Then the app would be perfect."
2,Anetzzz,"Update: developers emailed me acknowledging my initial feedback but the app did not change for the better. I stopped using it because of how it still forces you to manually bypass Reasons, instead of letting the default be just log your emotions and manually choose to enter Reason. Now I came back after a month because of an intense emotional day, for one reason: to use the guided ‘solution’ option it had originally. When I first downloaded the app if you out in an emotion it would link that to a suggested solution, a movement or a rethink or a video. Now there no suggestion based on your entered emotion. So we the people are who struggle are left to browse the solutions and wow somehow just know which one is going to help us? Sorry that is not helpful. I can get the same stuff with a google search. Had to delete the app, it’s not living up to its potential. Initial feedback: Liking this app, helps me be better tuned in to my actual emotions. Recent update forced you to open the Reason entry page. Previously you could opt to open this entry page. Please allow the norm to be a dual option: bypass or enter. I hate having to click extra when I don’t have a reason I want to enter. I also hate how this feels like data mining. Thank you for considering how the current UI impacts the feelings of users."
5,saladtuna,"I love the simple design of How We Feel. The matrix of emotion words is really helpful and easy to use, I find it much easier to just open the app and log my emotions than to journal. The best part of the app is that all of the features are actually completely free, the lessons on understanding your emotions, de-stressing exercises, emotion word matrix, additional journaling features, and mood analysis are all free and there are no subscriptions to be seen. I really recommend How We Feel to anyone who already likes journaling and mindfulness, who is like me and is very bad at forming new habits, or just anyone who feels curious about understanding their own emotions better. The analysis tab lets you look at all your logged moods over time so you can start to see patterns emerge. Do you log being fatigued more often when you have a big project you’re working on? Do you log more positive emotions in summer and spring than winter and fall? Would also be useful for anyone starting on mental health recovery who would like to track their progress over time. Overall wonderful completely free app with tons of features you can use at your own pace."
5,Duckluv,"As someone who has been struggling with a lot of various brain traumas, leading me to become isolated and feeling hopeless, I am having such a good experience reconnecting with myself thru this app. I have been going through a lot mentally and it’s been getting harder and harder the past few years to talk to people and make friends and feel good about myself. With the help from my doctor, self evaluating, and asking many MANYYYYY questions, I was finally able to talk about my experiences and how it affected the way I thought about myself and the world around me. This app is such a wonderfully made and well thought out tool for people to use and benefit from!! And it is also really rewarding to be able to see a physical representation of my thoughts and feelings adapting to life’s changes. Life is so hard to keep up with for me emotionally and I’m writing this long review because I believe we all have the power and tools within our thoughts and brains to help ourselves get better every day ❤️if the developers are reading this I would like to say thank you for all your help in my self healing journey, it’s greatly appreciated❤️"
5,MeelsM7,"How we feel has been very helpful with figuring out how I feel when I’m asked, which has been something that I have found very frustrating, as well as when I have overwhelming feelings I might not know how to deal with yet! It’s also been very helpful in communicating my feelings more effectively with my family and friends!! If I could change one thing about the app I think I would add a feature that allows me to change the color of the feeling that I choose for the specific entry. Not for the overall category of the feeling but so I have more range to express exactly how I’m feeling whether that’s in a private or shared entry. For example when I am using the app sometimes the word will describe how I’m feeling however because it is a harsh red color my brain immediately causes me to feel that it’s negative, that feeling “uneasy” is bad even if it’s just mild, and that gives me a little anxiety sometimes. (Which in itself is no big deal! But for the overall comfort of expressing how you feel I think it would be helpful!)"
2,Leeloominai_D,"Two stars because it’s the only emotion app that i’ll actually use, the rest of them trigger that utter rejection thing my adhd brain does where i have to get it away from me asap before the boredom it induces becomes too painful. This one doesn’t do that, so yay there. Visually appealing. Emotional choices are limited and not customizable leaving the app culturally prescriptive (white-washy/male supremacy-based/based on status quo, not inclusive etc) and not descriptive. None of the synch to health or weather options work accurately so if you use those features and actually look through the data you realize it’s all inaccurate and you have to go back in and add them manually which takes too long to bother with it if you’re already busy so basically just makes those features useless. The period reports were clearly designed by someone who has never had a period, so even if that part synchs who cares because the data it’s charting isn’t useful to anyone who actually has periods - so it’s like cool chart but who cares on that one. Seems like a good beta release with a lot of potential but it’s definitely not there yet. The feedback team is very responsive and assures me it’s still a work in progress, so we’ll see how it goes."
5,Kur0taku,"Edit: this issue has finally been fixed! Now been able to access my old entries, make new ones and keep it all backed up 🤩  This is honestly meant to be a 5-star review because this app has done so much to help me connect with myself and my loved ones in the 3 or so months I’ve used it. An intuitive premise that is efficiently executed, I’ve found my experience using this to not only be really empowering, but also an essential aid in keeping myself regular with mental health check-ins - not to mention vastly expanding my vocabulary and toolset to express and explore difficult experiences and emotions. Ultimately, I’d gladly revise my star rating as soon as I get this one bug worked out - my app has been crashing on startup every time I’ve attempted to use it since the last update, and unfortunately I wasn’t aware if/that iCloud sync had been available when I started using it. I’d love it if I could regain access to the app without having to lose the previous data I’ve accumulated, so fingers crossed that this gets noticed 🤞🏾"
5,appiaha,"Love this app, it provides a convenient way to document my days and I love using data to really see how I have been feeling. I use it as my full on journal now! There are two things that would make it even better, 1) being able to record a voice memo without having to keep holding down the button at the same time. Sometimes I just want to press record, and talk while I’m multitasking and this would make it more convenient. 2) being able to have a log in so that we can access our journal anywhere - without this, if we have to delete the app and redownload later for any reason (ie. Not enough phone storage), we won’t lose all of our entries. I’ve had to delete it a few times and it is frustrating to see that we lose all that data that we collected over a few months!  Otherwise, love the app, it’s aesthetically pleasing and simplistic - I recommend it to my friends all the time. I hope the team continues to add new words!"
5,Coco bakery,"wow, I never write reviews for apps but I just love this app so much. Its helped me drastically get in touch with my feelings, i've been able to become more mindful, as well as increase the joy in my life. I love the features like being able take a picture, the color coordination, and the analysis option where we can examine our feelings over time.  I also loved the little videos in the beginning, i found them very helpful. Generally I love this app, I use it alot and its improved my life and my relationships with the people around me.   If I could offer a suggestion it would be to configure a way to add more specific feelings. Sometimes i feel a very specific emotion and Im unable to properly document it. Being able to see the different emotions is extremely helpful though. Sometimes I also feel alot of different emotions all at once. I might just be a specific audience but those would be cool. Thank you for creating such a great app and allowing us to use it for free!  All Love, Evie"
3,psychicdaydreams,"Sometimes I'm avoidant, bummed, spiraling, distracted, on edge, aroused, verklempt. (Not an exhaustive list.) But if I'm feeling any of those things and using this app, I can't accurately describe... how I feel. Which makes me feel frustrated. At least if I ever get ""canceled"" I have an entry for that 🙄 I disagree with the categorization of some of the emotions as ""pleasant/unpleasant,"" such as fragile (should be unpleasant), astonished (it depends), and impassioned/passionate (again, it depends). I also feel like it's in general missing the ability to clearly represent singular emotions that are by definition not clearly one or the other, such as bittersweet. On a UX level, I didn't find it intuitive that emotions not listed on the grid would be available in search, and I didn't realize the plus allowed you to add a second emotion for a good week. I've also kept experiencing this one annoying thing with trying to enter emotions where as soon as I tap away from the search bar, it autocorrects, and so the first few letters of whatever I was searching for changes to something else, so I have to go back and type it in again."
5,threew33ks_4k!dz,"This app is simple. But the interface is cute and makes tracking moods less of a “blah” habit. A major perk of the app is being able to add places, situations, and people in addition to the preset ones already loaded in the app so you can better match the information you’re collecting to your own life and specifics. My spouse and I are using the app individually but use the info to check in with each other throughout the day/week as needed regarding our individual mental health and how to better support each other. Additionally, as someone who lives with chronic pain, being able to add information about my pain alongside the notes of my mood(s), - you can add 2 per check in - the life moment/situation during that specific time, where I am located, and who I am with and have it time stamped is helpful to notice triggers and/or patterns in my illnesses to sort between things in my life may be helping or hindering the illnesses."
2,dancingbrook,"I detest having to choose either high or low and pleasant or unpleasant, more so at the start.  Can’t I just be OK sometimes?  Couldn’t find a way to share these thoughts: 1) I saw a review, asking to be able to change the time entries, so one could log how they’re feeling at an earlier time, but I did not see the suggestion implemented in the version log, even though the response to review suggested developer would make that change. (Update: it seems the change was implemented but wasn’t listed in the version history) 2) When setting up the app initially, I was given 4 times of day to check in; the labels on these times didn’t make sense for my way of thinking. I’d like to be able to check in when I wake up, late morning, mid afternoon, and in the evening. These times are based on my recollection of significant periods of time where I am aware of significant mood shifts, times of acute awareness. The labels offered, morning afternoon, evening and evening didn’t seem right. 3) Selecting one mood feels too constrained; I certainly feel more than one mood at a time. 4) It needs a lock, so someone using my phone isn’t able to access my info."
5,Danie728,"Wow. Without knowing it, I’ve truly needed something like this to help me identify my emotions. I struggle to identify emotions and differentiate them. Most of the time I can’t make sense of how I am feeling. This causes me confusion and frustration and a lot of self critique. I have no idea how I stumbled upon this app, but I’m so glad I did. From the initial pick of the color, identifying my energy levels- this helps me narrow it down. I find the word that I feel best fits it and then read the description. This helps me ask myself “does that feel right?” often I need to adjust and read surrounding words but I always find something close enough (my suggestion in the search is maybe somehow provide alternatives with synonyms). With time I do feel like I am getting better at identifying what I feel in a moment myself and further to notice how often an emotion may swing within minutes and being able to document that always feels amazing."
4,Envy!!,"Other than one or two little things I absolutely love this app, it’s the only mood tracker i’ve been able to use consistently. One, I wish that you could write in your own emotions. Sometimes I know exactly what I’m feeling and it’s a little disappointing when I can’t track the feeling I have in mind. Second, I’m not a huge fan of how the exercise and sleep tracking works at the moment. I don’t think that exercise minutes should automatically apply to all the entries earlier in the day. It’s a little frustrating when I’m trying to track how exercise affects my mood and I can’t get an accurate picture of that because when I worked out at 5pm, the app applied that to all my emotions earlier in the day. The same thing goes for sleep. I think that automatically having exercise and sleep apply for the rest of the day makes sense, but you should have the option to change it, and have each entry be independent of everything that came before it."
4,TermyYT,"Hi devs, This app is awesome and I can't thank you enough for making it one that is free and runs on donations. All the other apps of this kind usually have subscriptions and I can't afford them, so it's wonderful having an app of this quality at my fingertips. With that said, I did run into one immediate issue when using the app on my iPhone XR: When scrolling down and tapping on emotions on the Check In tab, the emotion animation opens briefly and then immediately fades to black. I restart the app, open up the emotion, and it seems to be fixed at first, but once the UI with the ""Save"" button appears, it quickly fades to black again and the only fix is restarting the app again. Please fix this! It makes it hard to alter details of an emotion after its creation! Other than that, the app looks good so far. Thank you for everything.  Update: I have discovered that this issue is only on specific models. I have an iPhone XR. Please fix it for this iPhone model!"
5,Flemfive,"I think this is maybe the second time I’ve written a review in my life. I am an adolescent and family therapist and have had more success in getting resistant adolescents/families to track their mood hands down with this app. Comments such as “it’s so smooth/slick/easy” “like how it reminds me”. Thank you thank you. Feedback from real world use. Experiences often come with numerous feelings and it would be great to be able to identify more than one (I just add these to my journal lines for now). Also feelings come with physical symptoms. As part of the “noticing” it would be great to add “where do you notice that emotion in your body?”. Again could also add that in the notes function but for new trackers the prompts would be helpful. Marc, love Permission to Feel and the great work your team is doing to change our relationship with our feelings. Kudos to you and the team. Much gratefulness. Please consider adding app usage for other platforms."
5,Storyofagirl82,"I am a middle aged woman that has been through the ringer of behavioral health before it was called “Behavioral Health.” I have seen many counselors, psychiatrists, and have been to more than 1 inpatient psychiatric care facility. I like that this app allows me to track my mood over time. I love that this app gives short videos (1minute or so) to guide me through my feelings. In childhood I was kind of discouraged from having feelings- being told “you’re too sensitive.” Or not allowed to be angry because it went against my religious beliefs at the time.  What I really like- I feel no judgment, just acknowledging the feeling I’m having at the time. I also like that you add what you’re doing while having this feeling, who you’re with, and a place to write a little note- ie “I feel sad today because it’s my mom’s birthday and she’s no longer with us.” I told my counselor about this app and he agreed that it is a very useful tool."
5,Faruk Ramic,"I struggle a lot with managing my emotions and figuring out what to do with journaling, self-talk, etc. I feel as though it was made 10,000x easier with this app. It offers helpful tools and supportive instructional videos as you fill in your moods for the day. Keeping track of what causes what mood has always been very difficult for me to do on my own (and I even kept a Brene Brown Atlas of the Heart emotion chart with me, but that was too clunky and obtuse at times). With this app I can let myself know that I can feel anger and it will change into something better, or if an emotion I’m having is not as extreme as I thought it would be. Please, I plead of you, get this app and let your friends and family get this app too because it will help you understand yourself and others way better than you’d expect. You can cry and play golf at the same time, it’s okay."
5,Roarsha-1,"At first, I was skeptical of this app that would be some kind of bloatware or something, but I’m pleasantly surprised how easy it is to use, and they provide you with reminders that aren’t just in your face all the time, it’s just a gentle reminder, like hey check in how you’re feeling at this time, and you can figure those times. It has a boatload of emotions and feelings that not only describe what a feeling means, but when you start getting into the groove of things, and use it frequently It actually brings up lessons on what that particular feeling or emotion does or gives more insight into how it can be good or bad for you. This app has been very helpful in my journey of learning CBT on my own. It’s a great app, and I recommend it to anybody who’s trying to learn how to identify their feelings and learn coping skills, and strategies to deal with them!"
5,Sunshine245,"I have only been using it for 3 days but I see a clear pattern in my feeling, thoughts, and time of day. I have post COVID syndrome at the moment so understanding what’s going on in times of energy vs fatigue, the negative thoughts and self-judgement, and even time of day and activities vs rest are so important and this app has allowed me to see clear patterns to take action upon.  I love that each emotion has a definition, this allows me to find which emotion best describes my state while also expanding my feeling vocabulary.  In using the notes section I often find that my high feelings are actually secondary emotions. I use the notes section to write what’s going on for me at the moment, like a journal entry, which allows me to uncover the primary emotion by looking at the feeling word I actually use the most.  I am grateful for this app, and I hope this review is helpful to others! ❤️"
5,Albie_Rod,"This app has been so good for my emotional and physical health. Before I would say major feelings ex:sad mad happy, but this app dives deeper than just the regular used feelings. It gives you real options that you’re more than likely feeling but because we’re so used to using major feelings we’ve or might I say I have become numb to expressing myself. I’ve checked in 21 times and I can see my patterns develop, and see I hate Monday mornings haha. I’ve told all my family and friends about this app as well, some use it some don’t. But it does help me personally check in with myself and friends. One thing I would add is when you add friends and they share feelings with you and vice verse maybe adding a direct text to them to check in or an emoji reaction like teams chat. Other than that I’m happy say this is my first review on an app and I’ll continue using it."
5,:D Hippie Chickie 😀,"Best emotional awareness app in the App store & ITS 100% FREE. There’s no pushy in app purchases & no up-selling of any kind. Our entire family now has it on their phones. It's an amazing tool for teenagers (& everyone) to develop greater self awareness, expand their emotional vocabulary & bandwidth, and totally helps us to better identify correlations between moods, emotions & triggers with external & internal stressors like environment, sleep, exercise, people, & we utilize the note area to make a quick note of our dietary choices & supplements as well.  This app provides free tools such as short videos, tutorials, etc to manage & navigate emotions.  My 11-21year old span of kids totally internalize these videos as it’s not coming from us, their parents🤣 🙏🏽App developers- Please consider adding meditation/mindfulness/focused reflection minutes/hours into the sleep/exercise/weather equation. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽"
5,giratina.me,"I've had this app for about a year now and it's been exciting to see how much this app has grown!   -learning about various emotions and their definitions -different input methods (type, voice, etc). I also have used voice to text  -tagging entries; haven't needed to look back at previous entires yet but I enjoy building a tagging system to make the process easier if needed  -no ads (tysm for making this very accessible. I'm not sure if anything has changed with the videos since I only used them at the beginning but I will look into them again -reminders; can be adjusted which is nice. I need to stop swiping them away! -reflect feature seems promising for those wanting for more insight.   I don't have input on its data back up or privacy components. With all apps, be mindful of what is being shared and read further into terms as needed.   As a mental health provider, I find this to be a great start up tool or long term companion for individuals to use. This is not a replacement for therapy services; however, this is an excellent way to start acknowledging feelings and thoughts. Can be used to collect data to bring into sessions or mental health services to discuss with a provider.   Tldr I'm really enjoying the app, excited to learn more!"
4,SopStr99,Absolutely loving the graphic mood tracking. Most engaging mood tracker I’ve used so far. I’ve tried eMoods and Moodtrack but the simplicity of the check-ins have helped me be way more consistent using How We Feel. Also the visual representations of the data you put in are extremely easy to read and encourage you to add data for more and more comprehensive understandings of yourself.  The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because the meditations that were first shown to me were about things I’m actively trying to do less of (ie how to be more empathetic when I over-empathize). I’m going to try more of the practices later and if they’re good I’ll have to come back and revise this!   Overall this is an amazing free app I’d recommend to anyone who needs a mood tracker. And a great place to start if you need more tools for understanding your moods and how to relate to them in general.
4,MCDaniels01,"This app was recommended to me by my therapist as a way for my spouse and I to share our feelings/emotions throughout the day. It’s a great tool for doing that! Otherwise, we would never talk about these things. I love the videos and find them short and on point which makes watching them easy to do. I also LOVE that the feelings have little descriptions with them because I have a hard time identifying my emotions, but this helps! The only thing, ONLY thing, I really want from this app that I can’t seem to be able to find, is a way to see my spouse’s past feelings. You can add friends and share your emotions and thoughts with them, but there is no way to track what your “friends” enter. You only get to see the most recent entry and the one before that then disappears. Having a way to go back and look, as a reference point, would be extremely helpful."
4,mryapapaya,"I love the variety of emotions to choose from and many other helpful features, along with the visual appeal. I’m very happy that this app is free!! However, if you’re looking to improve the app, there are many requests and recommendations in the reviews. Some of them are honestly pretty good ideas. Most people seem to be complaining about a specific detail/feature that they would like, and this could be solved by making the app more customizable. For example, making a way to edit the categories of emotions, the colors associated, and the emotions themselves. I’d appreciate a way to do all of these things and toggle whether I’d prefer to customize the emotions grid or use the default.   Thank you so much for creating this wonderful tool that is so accessible! It’s a great resource regardless of whether you add specific requests or not."
5,Willie Shakes,"This app is amazing in both its simplicity and the historical analytical depth that naturally occurs when you regularly log your feelings. You can look back on your entries in beautiful graphics and charts and understand how your location, who you are with, how much you e exercised, and heck even how the weather affects your emotions. I try to log when I’m feeling a strong emotion, either positive or negative, but also try to remember to check in every couple of days regardless. I went on a kick for about 6-8 months where I was logging multiple times a day and that really helped me identify some patterns and habits that I could address to improve my overall mood. There are also some really great, really short coaching videos on a variety of topics that I highly recommend exploring. Have fun!"
5,hmbxoxoxo,"This app is nice if you don’t have the patience to keep a journal, you can either put in a little note of how you’re feeling, or just pick some emotions and go about your day. If someone isn’t used to understanding how they feel, the app shows you how to understand what your emotions are trying to tell you and what you can do to fix it.   My favorite feature is the ability to share your feelings with others, and it’s not some weird intervention/therapy session. It’s very noninvasive, you can share as much or little with your friend’s or family. You can also not share.   The videos are quick, they offer captions, and even lists little activities on how to do things that fit how you feel. If you don’t want to watch the videos, you can just read a short list on how to do it."
5,khope133,"As someone who finds it hard to explain what I’m feeling when I’m feeling it, this app is extremely helpful. It’s so much easier to work through my emotions when I can identify them. I honestly can’t believe this app is free (and I beg it stays that way). The visual breathing exercises are also amazing, and I love having that visual diagram. It’s incredibly helpful to be so mindful to try to pick from like 20 different red adjectives and realize “oh actually I’m feeling more yellow right now” and be able to work on working through whatever I need to. It’s also very valuable to also log the good feelings! That way you have a representation of the fact that there’s usually a little good in every day. I love to check in when I’m not prompted too, just so I stay mindful throughout my day. I love this app seriously"
5,BrittanyWestover,"I’ve struggled in the past actually logging my mood on most other mood trackers, but this app is so much more than that. It’s so helpful, fun, and aesthetically pleasing. I love the design of it all, and that there aren’t annoying notifications. There’s only one type of notification, and it’s to remind you at the time you set to record how you’re feeling in the moment. I love that it’s been helping me identify exactly what it is I’m feeling and what that emotion is by definition. I also love that it can double as a journaling app and that it can connect to my Health App so I can understand more about why I may be feeling the way I’m feeling (ex: cycle, sleep, exercise, etc.). Overall, this has become one of my favorite apps to use. I’ve already recommended it to several family members and friends."
5,hailstormxxx,"This is such an amazing app, especially that it’s entirely free and there are no features locked behind a paywall. I love how the emotions are sorted, and the definitions are so helpful. Truly I cannot say enough nice things about this app, and I have recommended it to all my friends.   I do have two suggestions though! One is the ability to edit the time stamp on logs, which I see you’ve already noted in another review, so that’s great! The other is a setting for what time the day resets. I am a night owl and I’m rarely in bed before midnight, but I don’t like that any check ins after 12am count towards the next day. It can end up making that day appear more positive/negative than it actually was.   Thank you for reading, and thank you so much for making what is the best emotion tracking app hands down."
5,Nathan Etta,i’ve been using this app for the past few weeks and I love how simple it is to use. how many options you have for how you are feeling and the fact that it gives you lessons and videos to watch to help with whatever you’re feeling and to understand your emotions better. The only thing I would want is Apple Health integration. Apple just added in iOS 17 their own similar emotion feeling logging into the Apple Health app. it would be cool if whenever I log my emotions in how we feel it shows up in the Health app with the rest of my health metrics. just a thought.  I like being able to not have to always use Apple for health metrics but since I use other apps like how we feel and I use apples first party apps for Health it would be nice to see everything in one place.
5,Beluga_Tejas,"It took me a long time to find a therapist I really click with and gives valuable strategies and feedback to my anxiety and depression, and with a scatter brain memory like mine, it is easy to gaslight myself into thinking I am overreacting. But being able to track my emotions and see I do have a problem, helped to be more confident in my feelings, as it wasn’t someone talking me down, but rather looking at myself and saying I have to do something about this. Then when money got tight and school demanded all my time, I turned to the strategies HWF offered. These tools are amazing, I don’t think I’d be as happy and healthy as I am now if it weren’t for these tools. I am extremely thankful for the developers, because I don’t have the money to help myself, I have taken this and ran so far with it."
5,sarahswiftsinger,"I've legitimately been on a quest to find the best emotion tracker, and How We Feel is the best one, period. I highly highly value that this app is 100% free, but it's so good I'd probably pay for it too. The range of emotions is awesome to see, especially that they keep adding more. Most other emotion trackers are on a linear spectrum and harder to qualify. One word I would add that I haven't seen as of writing this is lethargic. I feel that one quite often and I usually go with ""meh"" to identify that feeling in the app. But I've successfully referred family and friends to this app because it is essential, helpful, and satisfying to learn self awareness and has help our emotional regulation and alleviated triggers and addictive episodes. Please never stray away from the mission of this project, as it has helped so much in my corner."
4,Read Th!s,"I love this app so much. I love the new features with the AI that helps us deeper. Reflect the only problem is that every time I go to the tools section. The app closes and shuts down completely. Another thing that I wish would that I deleted this app and reinstalled it, hoping that it would not crash anymore, but it still crashing and now all of my data is lost😭 another thing is that in one of the tools- I tried to delete just one of the photos that helps me recap on positive memories and instead it deleted EVERYTHING 🥺💔 if y’all could please fix this, and have a better way to save data. I would really appreciate it! I even saved all my data to the cloud and after re-downloading it it’s gone. I don’t know if I’ll be able to get it back or not but I’ll try. Aside from the bugs I’ve been using it for a while now!😍"
5,Exodus1213,"This has been a great tool in supportive me in my goal of emotional healing. The one issue I have is that setting how long you’ve done an activity, ie sleeping, meditating, exercising, etc, the method is a bit wonky. Instead of adding a number of minutes/hours it gives you a time of day? So say you’ve meditated for one hour, you’d have to set that as “1 am” which has nothing to do with the time of day you were actually doing the activity, yet after setting it registers as “1 hour.” Other than that, it’s been a fantastic resource in helping manage my moods and understanding where in life I need to find balance. I’m impressed with the level of emotional comprehension I’ve gained over the past year since starting with this app as opposed to traditional journaling. Keep up the great work!"
5,ℐ𝒳ℒ ℛℯ𝓋𝒾ℯ𝓌ℯ𝓇,"Obviously us as teens struggle with a lot of stuff. I was recommended this app by my therapist and decided to try it out. At first I was pretty skeptical because almost all apps like this are hidden behind a paywall, but y’all have no idea how much relief hit me when I opened it and saw that there was no premium choice, no subscription, nothing. Ever since then I’ve been using this app whenever I feel down or feel that I need to write my emotions down. However there is one problem: I’ve tried singing in several times but it never works. Even when it says that the sign in was verified I’m still on the same page. Perhaps it’s because the app is kind of slow at times? Idk but it’s definitely not me because my WiFi was at full bar."
3,robinminttea,"I love this app! It’s helped me greatly with managing my emotions and better regulating them. Contrary to other reviewers, I like how they break down emotions. It helps me see them as normal things that aren’t going to last forever. However, I have experienced some annoying glitches, much like other users. During the check-in, after I select my emotion, sometimes the details page will just go dark and I have no way to record anything other than my emotion. Sometimes it won’t, but after I add a note and click “done” the screen will turn dark again. A helpful strategy that I use is to add my note and fill in the rest of the details before I click “done” (that’s possible). The creators of this app haven’t responded to any complaints as far as I know, but I hope they fix things soon. Overall, the app is wonderful and has made a huge difference in my life."
5,Ab basset,"I am someone who truly struggles with identifying and verbalizing my emotions, and I think the first step to helping this issue is working on identifying what I am feeling. This app helps with the overwhelming feeling of trying to pinpoint what you are feeling. It starts you off trying to pick between four overall feelings, and then from there gives you more options, each option gives you the definition of the feeling, and then you can say where you were when you felt, who you were with, and what you were doing. Not only does this app help you identify your feelings, but there are videos to help teach how to regulate and understand your feelings. Over I have had the app for about a week and truly appreciate and love it."
5,Taryn Hiro,"I am a graphic designer and therapist and have found so much value in your app~ for myself, with friends and family and clients. I have told so many people about it because it is incredivly well-designed, intuitive and easy to use. The one thing that limits my interaction with it is only being able to choose one emotion for a check-in. I always feel more than one feeling at a time and it puts a lot of pressure on the emotion I choose accuracy-wise. Even just being able to choose 2 would help, although honestly, sometimes I can easily name 5-8 that I feel in a given moment. If you could make any change to address this, that would be so so helpful! Thank you for an incredible app."
3, Care Wilson,"I’m a practicing therapist and one of my clients introduced me to this app a few months ago. I downloaded and then “tested” it for myself before mentioning it to anyone. Since then, I have assigned it’s use as homework to every client I have, WITH AN IPHONE. All of my clients who have other phones are currently out of luck as it is not available to them. Such a disappointment! I, and those who are using it, LOVE, love, love! I am excited and grateful that my clients can practice checking in with themselves, become better at identifying their emotional cues and expand their emotion vocabulary! I joked with a friend, who is also a therapist, that it will be great to have clients report their feelings as something other than annoyed or stressed. My only criticism is I wish it was more widely available. To its creators: Please know that it is truly valuable for anyone and thank you for sharing! In metta, LPC in Arizona"
5,Amoeba356,I literally never write reviews but I will for this app bc it’s the best app I have. It’s free and there aren’t any ads which I can’t say about any other app I’ve used to track my emotions(or most other apps I’ve used ever). There are so many detailed options for emotions to choose from and each of them has definitions so I definitely have learned a lot of new vocabulary. The stats they give are really easy to understand and organized well. I like that the emotions are categorized into three sections too bc it makes it easy to figure out how I feel when I know know how to put it into words. I really like the new ai thing they recently added with the reflections too bc it helps me think about why I’m feeling the way I am.
5,UnoDickles,"Truly amazing. My therapist recommended me the emotions wheel and one day joking stated that there must be an app. Low and behold, here it is. What’s so great about this compared to just a wheel is that hovering over feelings give you a description of what it is. So it’s really helped me identity what certain emotions are and making em realize that I do have a wider range than I thought. It also lets you track certain things like menstruation and activity level and meditation.   This app is truly something. I’m honestly addicted ti logging my feelings now just so. Can better understand myself. I’m thankful I’ve come across it!   And so so thankful that it’s fully free. You guys are doing unbelievable work by allowing this tool to be free for people. Thank you 💙"
5,BiliotheticAesthetic,"I’m not a journaler and have struggled to maintain any consistent log of my emotions to be able to make connections, track patterns, and help myself cope better. This app has been so easy to use and I’ve been writing little journal notes with my feelings for over a month. I appreciate the altruistic nature of the app - zero ads, no in-app purchases, no weird plugs for businesses or products.   The more you use the app, the easier it is to find new and helpful features like logging additional emotions, viewing trends, adding pictures, and even the AI “go deeper” feature that lets you dig into your emotions with automated prompts. I can’t recommend this app enough and have helped several people get started using it!"
4,Frangepanni,"Love this app. It’s simple to use, informative, helpful, and has aided me in better understanding my emotions.  Request for Developers: can you allow the option of clicking on the emotion you want even if spelled wrong? Right now, the emotions I want to type appear in the search even if I spell them wrong. BUT they disappear when I try to tap on them. This forces me to retype the emotion with absolutely perfect spelling even though the app knows what emotion I am searching for. This gets really frustrating when I keep hitting the wrong keys with my fat thumbs and sometimes I have to retype several times. Seems like it should be an easy fix that has been overlooking seeing as the app is smart enough to know what emotion want. It just won’t allow me to click on it."
5,Coloradokayla58,"I’m not even exaggerating when I say it’s the best I’ve ever had. I grew up not being allowed to cry, to feel anything less than good, to express any emotions. Being in my mid 30s I’ve found my child has a better sense of his emotions than I do. Just being able to name what emotions I’m experiencing is a challenge for me and this is making it much easier. The graphics are beautiful, I love that I can customize it to what fits in my life, the videos are so helpful and I genuinely could go on and on. Plus you’re doing it for free, completely free. Not free with ads or free for a week. 100% free. That’s an invaluable resource that’s allowed me to grow and expand my knowledge while being an emotional scientist. Thank you so much."
5,askwhoisjohngalt,"Love the simplicity of this app. Love the options of words to describe moods and the little descriptions that help you choose. I love that you can add information in your own words to each entry, or just bypass it if you’re not in the mood. Being able to backdate entries for the times you’re too tired or just not in the mood to create an entry is also fantastic.  What it needs to be great- a way to visualize the upswings and downward trends in context over time. Basically a line graph that would show if you’re feeling going in a positive direction with changes or negative. And finally, a way to export this or save as an image file to be shared or kept as time goes on so you can compare time periods."
5,red_bean212,"The title says it. Because this isn’t the kind of thing that’s taught in school (despite its importance in both mental and physical health and relationships), I am so grateful for the team who built and iterated on this wonderful app that has helped me with my self-growth.  I’ve found it much easier to check in using this app than using my previous methods (looking through the different emotions categorizations I’ve found before from various sources, like a journal article graphic, Plutchik’s wheel, and Drummond’s collection). Consequently, I’ve been checking in with myself more often.   Such a delightful UI as well. Good job UX and/or UI designers (and other design impacters - UX researchers, info architects, design strategists, etc)"
5,spookiboi,"I’ve used many “Daily Journal” apps in the past. I felt like I couldn’t always articulate exactly what I was feeling and what habits may be contributing to those feelings. With this app I can! I can also keep track of my sleeping habits, exercise habits, and I’ve been using it to montier how much caffeine I’m consuming and how much alcohol I’m drinking. I even use the notes button to keep track of my eating habits. I feel like this app has everything I could’ve asked for and more. I love being able to share my mood with my boyfriend as well so we can bridge conversations about how we’re feeling. I love this app so much! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good daily journal app, mood tracker, or even to track habits."
5,"""DT"" Rosho","I absolutely love this app. I have Autism, and one of the most negative affects of this intellectual disorder are that I have trouble regulating my mood when I’m stressed or in a situation that I feel uncomfortable with. In the past, I dealt with them with negativism. Because I downloaded this app as a tool to check myself in thrice a day, I’m able to regulate it better. Anger is a normal human emotion, and I think we can all agree on it.  However, If we want to be part of a civilized society, we are responsible for keeping our own anger in check, and that’s the most important part If we want to feel welcomed to other people around. My final thoughts are that I fully recommend anyone who is struggling with anger issues to download this app."
5,The quick white fox,"This app honestly surprised me. It seems like almost every app this day asks for some sort of monthly subscription or payment, but not this. It offers an amazingly simple and pleasing layout along with helpful videos that are educational but not a bore or chore to sit through. This is the first app that I have truly felt fulfilled with giving not 5 stars, but the maximum amount of stars available. I won’t lie and say this app fixed all my problems, but that was never the goal. It’s helped me to be more aware of how I’m feeling and given coping mechanisms to help analyze and feel those emotions. I’m giving five stars not to give five stars but because that’s all there is to give. Other apps take notes."
5,Voices in My Head,"Like a lot of folks, I often feel overwhelmed by my emotional states and the stressors in my life. There is so much to do and never enough time. This app has been an incredible tool for slowing down, just for a moment, to really consider how I am feeling. The practice of noting feelings, and tagging that emotion with what I'm doing, who I’m with, and where I am has given me valuable insight into what is having the most impact, both positive and negative, on my feelings. PLUS having the suggested strategies and lessons around emotional regulation has been super helpful. This app is quick and easy to use and an excellent tool for better understanding yourself. I cannot say enough good things about it. Try it! It’s free!"
4,isa-grace,"I do love this app! It’s great for tracking your emotions and looking for patterns.   However, I really wish they would change the menstrual tracking portion of this app.   The pattern I was looking for was whether my menstrual cycle affects my mental state, so I was so excited to see I could add my cycle to the check-ins! However I quickly realized this feature isn’t what I was looking for, because you can only link how heavy your flow is? I don’t care how heavy my flow is, I care where I am in my cycle: follicular, ovulation, luteal, or menstruation. I’m pretty sure that’s what most people care about when they’re considering their emotions and their cycle. Please please please change this, I think it would be so beneficial to all of your female users."
4,arthdex,"To the user: The concept is very nice. Similar to the emotions wheel. I think having this on an app is very helpful and I’d like to keep using it. Discovered through my doctor who asked me to check it out. Only removing one star for the bug below.  To the developer:  Major bug, please take a look. When editing any custom text and saving, the screen goes dark and no details are shown afterwards. No matter how much you go back and forward, that’s the abrupt end of that user journey. If you have more than one detail to add to your check-in, you have to keep closing the app and opening again to edit the entry and add more details for each one of the additional details you want to add for that checkin entry. This renders the app unusable, or at least bring one’s emotions on to the “red” quadrant ;-) Otherwise, great app. No. This is not user error. I’ve tested the app thoroughly and this happens on every instance of testing. (I’m a product analyst and do this all day)  One last thing, having a saved user profile or an option to re-upload your downloaded data would be nice in case you have to delete the app and save again. That option wasn’t apparent to me."
1,Sirnailhead,"I’ve been using this, past going thru the lessons, as a journal of sorts. Between the analysis of my settings, words I type, ramblings I spoke and pictures I uploaded it was a good way to gauge the previous week w my therapist. But one day, possibly after an iOS or other update, it stopped working.   I will tap it and the little heart logo animation goes, screen goes black like it was loading my stuff and then the regular Home Screen pops up. So basically it won’t open. I tried to download the update but it has no working dl link. I offload the app and then tried to reinstall but it seems to go back to the version I had. This has been the case for about a month and definitely has screwed up my routine. I’m sure there are similar apps but I don’t wish to lose the journal entries and such.   So when it works a 4 star app.  But if you use it and it suddenly stops and holds your thoughts hostage it’s a 1 star app.  Help?"
5,randomlengthyreviewer,"No other mental health related app has really grabbed my attention like this one. The sheer simplicity of using it is far and above what else is out there.  My favorite feature is actually the friends/networking component. It’s a bit janky at the moment (friend codes?!) and could use some better features (ability to share my emotions without sending push notifications to everyone), but being able to share emotions with friends overall has been amazing. Without trying to be, it’s become easily the best social media app on my phone.  In a world of shallow and vapid online interactions, this app actually brings people closer together and facilitates care and deep conversation with friends."
5,kschultz34,"I have been trying to find an easy to use and FREE app that I could keep track of my mood at any given time of the day and add a note as to why I feel that way. This app allows you quick access to “check in”, pick your mood and either save it as is or you can add a note, a photo or voice memo. Depending on your mood it offers a quick minute video on how to relax or meditate or get through the mood. You can choose to skip or watch the video. The videos are helpful and are straight and to the point. This is by far my favorite app and I can see myself using this for months and years to come. And it’s totally free, everything about it. Which is amazing!"
5,Reviewing1874,"I really love this check in app. It’s so smooth and easy to navigate - I’ve tried a lot of different check in apps like this, but this one is by far my favorite. One of my favorite parts might just be the moving space with the feeling bubbles - very fun to swish around. A big plus for me is that there is no paid version, so you get everything you possibly can without having to subscribe. I also like the fact that it’s for research - everything you put in is going to science (but fear not, it’s anonymous), which is something I think is really cool in itself. It’s honestly a really refreshing software; I’ve recommended it to my sister and she loves it too."
5,HelloDakoda,"I just downloaded this app, but I already love it so much! I typically don’t feel the need to write reviews for apps, but this one is an exception.  I love that you can add everything from how much you slept to the people that you are with… and it’s not a very time consuming entry. Being able to put things in quickly without taking too long really allows you to collect the information in a seamless fashion.   The only thing is that I really wish this was available on the Apple Watch as well! I work in the Mental Health Unit at my local hospital and having the ability to put something in quickly on my watch would be wonderful. Something to look forward to I hope!"
5,Reang28,I really liked this app before and I like it even more now. The best features of being able to pick out an emotion with all of its descriptions is pretty useful. I feel like when I log positive emotions I’m able to focus on those more and feel those fully. The AI features on this are pretty new or at least I’m nearly experiencing them and they are really amazing. They are really helping me reframe. They also help with finding insight. I don’t know how to view the affirmations and insights and what not that I’ve bookmarked from the AI tool wish I knew how cause I really like those affirmations and would like to be viewing them on a regular basis.
5,DangitDev,"I love the granular control you have over all the different emotions to pick through. The UI is genius because it is simultaneously visually appealing and delivers a user friendly way to explore what you may be grappling with in that moment. It gives you lots of control over how you want to contribute to your own journal (pictures, voice recording, basic text, health data, weather).  Not only does the journal part of this excel, it also provides a fantastic catalog of tools for emotional regulation. Provides helpful information for anyone, regardless of where they are on their journey! Really love this app and I think more people should be using it"
5,Canady117,"This has helped me track my emotions and better express how I’m feeling to my partner and my family.   One feature is like to see: the ability to have the app randomly send me multiple (2-4) notifications asking how I’m feeling throughout the day, as opposed to setting the times for myself and having them come in at the same time every day. That way, the app could catch me off guard and I can express my emotions with more variety. With the set schedule, it aligns with my daily schedule and many times I will feel the same way at the same time every day. I think the data would be more varied with a randomized notification option."
4,PBJMAPH,"I really love this app. Out of all the emotion trackers or digital journals I’ve tried, this one provides me with names for the wide variety of emotions I feel on a daily basis. I LOVE how each emotion is described so I can really pinpoint what I’m feeling. It really is revolutionary and I know it’ll help me to grow and understand myself more.  My only problem is that when I am inputting my check in, if I try to add a new activity it glitches and I am not able to edit anything else. It shows a blank screen instead of the regular editing options when I try to go back in to edit it. This really is my only problem with the app, I think otherwise that it’s welcoming and very easy to use, I’m glad I came across it!"
5,Carmen 👌🏻 👌🏻 👌🏻,"i really love how we feel, it makes tracking my emotions and putting them into words super easy and convenient. i struggle a lot with typing or writing out how i feel so the voice recording is really nice. the first option of choosing from four options and then getting broader is SO helpful and i love the support the app gives you when choosing a negative emotion.  one thing that i would suggest is a button where you can write in your own emotion, while there are 144 options sometimes i feel something that doesn’t fit into those that accurately describes my emotion. since every emotion has a unique shape, maybe it could be a blob?"
5,theoneandonlyallyn,"i dont have anything negative to say! except for an opinion that is just about something i think would be beneficial to be added.  as somebody that struggles with mood regulation, i tend to have moods that are a lot more severe than others. since the app categorizes by how many times you’ve checked in the emotion, it only shows the percents of how many times u had negative or positive emotions. so for me, when im looking over my stats, and sharing them with my therapist or parents, it appeals to them i’m doing well since i have a higher percentage of yellow than red and blue. however, that’s not usually the case since my negative emotions are just as severe or worse than my positive emotions. so i think adding a feature where you could rank the feeling from 1-10 on severity and then having that affect the stats would be helpful. i hope somebody reads this review and tysm to the developers bc this is my main app i use to chart my emotions and it really helps with identifying what i’m feeling and having a grasp of how i feel every month."
4,Deez nuts whatever,"Update: I’m not sure how to reply to the response I got, and I also tried to email to separate emails that were invalid so I’m just gonna update my review in hopes of a response. At the top right corner, I don’t see three buttons to give me the option to edit. I only see the trash can to delete my check in  I’m a huge fan of the app, I got it around this time last year and it’s been amazing so far. However I noticed that with this recent update, I can’t figure out how to go back and edit my check-ins. Sometimes I’ll check in but at the moment I’m not able to write down my thoughts so I go back later on. I could use some assistance. Is anyone else having this issue?"
5,Flygirrrl33,"I never write reviews but this app is so great I needed to.I have been going through a lot of personal issues related to medical events, family and relationships. My therapist suggested I try this app and I can’t thank her enough. It is like having a daily therapist that you can talk to and get great feedback from that also helps you work through your feelings or thoughts. I have been checking in ~3 times a day and always do a reflection. If you don’t like to cry in front of people you can totally cry in front of this app. I should note, if you are dealing with serious mental health issues it is very important to seek help outside of this app."
4,Hodhksjdbvous,"I am loving the app and ability to access a lot of name of feelings to better pinpoint and understand what I am feeling. Thank you for this. A few suggestions: it doesn’t appear to use the data together across my devices even though I’m signed in with the same appleid. So now it appears I have two patterns, one from iPhone vs iPad. I love Mark Brackett’s work and use it in raising my daughter. It appears b/c she is under 18 or the parental controls I have on for her doesn’t allow her to share with me (friends) and I’d love to be able to allow that.  The app is so much more usable than the feeling wheel as it groups similar ranges, again helping more precisely name the feelings to better understand, allow, and process them."
5,prattieyo420,"I absolutely LOVE this app. As someone who struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and ADHD, sometimes I don’t even know what I’m feeling and sometimes I know all too well what I’m feeling. This app lets me acknowledge my emotions, keep track of them, and gives me space to explain why I feel this way. I love how it takes in account exercise, meditation, and sleep habits. The videos are also extremely helpful and useful. I’d love to see more videos uploaded because it’s the same 10 all around but either way the app is still amazing. Thank you to the creators! I’ll continue to use this app for the rest of my life! 🫂🩷  - Elizabeth Pratt"
5,ct applefan,"Excellent concept, and well designed! Love how visual it is and how there’s a description of every feeling. Easy to use and the content and analytics are super helpful. I find myself wanting to do check ins.   A couple of suggestions for the developers. Would be great to have a way to enter the time for when we’re not able to get to our phones in real time. But wouldn’t want to have to enter time for every entry.  Also would be great to have the ability to have profiles for multiple users. It would be great to have my kids (who don’t have their own phones yet) be able to use it.  Thank you for such a helpful app!"
3,Debikins,"I love the idea and how it tries to teach you, but the interface to choose how you're feeling is pretty overwhelming for someone who lacks the vocabulary to describe how they're feeling (you know, the target audience for this app). I like how each feeling has a definition when you tap it, but they are all so similar I find myself scrolling through tons of different feelings never finding quite the right one and forgetting which ones were close so I can’t easily narrow it down. PICTURES would make this 10,000% more useful. And a meme version would make it more fun and something I’d stick with longer. Tagging feelings for comparison before you choose the final one would be nice too, maybe I just haven’t figured that out yet."
5,haileylw,"I adore this app. I dislike journaling, I never stick to it. It’s hard for me to articulate how I’m feeling. But with this app, the definitions provided make it so easy to nail down exactly how I’m feeling. I do wish there were more neutral emotions but I guess that defeats deciphering my moods? I don’t see any downsides other than that. I’ve recommended this app to several close friends and they’ve enjoyed it as much as I have. Give it a go, it’s definitely worth a try. Even just to see the different emotions and their definitions helps me to calm down and feel acknowledged in myself. I don’t really utilize the tools, but one of my friends does and it’s a huge help for her."
5,georgianicholson,"I love this app, it has great functionality and I love that I can log thoughts through multiple modes. However, I would really love to be able to download my data and import downloaded data. I appreciate that keeping data local for privacy reasons means autosync and cloud functions can’t work, but I would love to be able to control my data through export/import. If I get a new phone I’m going to lose all my data and that is quite scary to me plus the idea that I could lose my data makes me less motivated to log (bc what’s the point then?). Still a great app, but please please please allow the option to download data"
5,Adventure Time LUVER,"I have never left a review for an app in my life. However, this is the first app where I really feel like it has works for me and my mental health. By all means it hasn’t fixed anything obviously therapy is best for that and exercise and whatever. But this app has been very helpful for me as someone who suffers from PTSD and anxiety and I take medicine for it as well. It has really helped me and moments when I am triggered and I love all of the exercises and tips that they have and make me feel less embarrassed or alone to try doing some self soothing, which I’ve never been able to do for my whole life. I think I will use this app for a long time."
4,Spicyeelsauce,Finally an app that is designed and genuinely has many tools and resources to unpack emotions that’s FREE* 😭 resources like this should be free and available to everyone without a pay wall.  Mental wellbeing resources should be a human right 😭   It has a combination of mood tracking and data analytics and will give you specific tools for the feelings you’re putting. Descriptions and definitions for those that have a hard time articulating.  Very intricate and detailed for people who are neurodivergent.  I enjoy the picture and voice options. And creating tags.   I wish there were some more complex and adult feelings. Like especially those of the romantic type. Also more frustrated emotions and for times where you’re not even low or high energy or even if you’re not even necessarily pleasant or non pleasant.   *as we know not everything in the world is free and this is a 501c org.  Based on their info it would seem they would only want to create more helpful tools based on our data. But who knows. Hoping how “I” feel won’t affect me[us] negatively in the future…
5,Laurelei88,"I have been finding this helpful in general, but I admit I’m writing this review because the “app support” link simply took me to a page that encouraged me to download the app and didn’t actually have any way to get support.  I love the overall idea of the app and I think it’s well executed. But, today when answering I discovered it didn’t contain the feeling I have. I wanted to share that with the developers to see if they plan to make changes in the future. But with no support function that’s impossible.  Love that this is FREE no subscriptions or ads. If you’re looking to increase your awareness of yourself this is a very helpful app."
5,abelina_rosie,"I really like this app and have found it extremely helpful! It is easy to use and I really like the analytics that help you discover through actual data what helps you have a happier life.   One suggestion I have for this app is that it needs to be able to add period/cycle data for women. Like at least allow people to add if they are/are not on their period. Since our hormonal changes can have profound impact on mood, I think this data would be important and perhaps guide people to see patterns. I say this as someone who typically has depressive episodes before my period and for whom it took years to make that connection!"
5,DanCates,"This app is extremely helpful in a number of ways:  1) Provides an effective outlet for quickly and clearly journaling emotions. It funnels me down from simple identification of my current energy into more subtle identification of the type of emotions I am feeling including complex combinations of positive and negative emotions happening concurrently.  2) It provides tags and syncs with Health app data to track my emotions against steps, sleep, weather data, meditation time, and contexts like people, work, and location. It presents this data and more in visualizations that are easy to read and help me understand patterns and frequencies with my emotions.  3) It provides helpful tutorials for coping mechanisms that enable me to process and endure the emotions in helpful ways. Some of these are breathing exercises, grounding techniques to break me out of fixating, and mindset techniques that help me better understand my context so that emotions don’t feel as overwhelming.   It does all of this in a pretty simple interface that is easy to use. Extremely satisfied."
5,Trig tan,"Honestly, I never leave reviews, maybe this is my first one. I have been using this app for a few months now. I have had a ton of journal apps but nothing quite did the trick.   I love the feeling of going through the bubbles and choosing an emotion or feeling. It feels therapeutic in a way. The developers can definitely add more emotions, but there’s a variety to choose from.   It also tells you how to manage your feelings well by giving you strategies. The narrations are helpful and calming.   I struggle with communicating my feelings but there’s an option to add your friends there. If you don’t really like chit chatting, or texting, but want to get deep into the matter to take care of people that matter to you, you can add them on the app. When my friends are feeling worse, I can quickly text them and ask them what’s going on.    When I journal in my feelings, I have the option to take photos and voice memos.   Anyways, the app is great. 10/10, editors please add more emotions or strategies. Tysm! 😊"
5,GinnaBeth,With all the apps out there waiting to drain your life away this one is far from it. It’s the kind of app that adds something to my life and is helpful to connect me with myself and with others in a deeper level. I was simply looking for an emotion wheel app to help me label my feelings and I stumbled upon this gem. I love that there are so many feelings to choose from with short descriptions to help me decipher the difference between similar emotions. I also love the fact that I can share what I am feeling with my friends and vice versa. Thank you for creating such a great tool and for sharing it with the world!
4,Taby777,"I have used this app for about a week and really enjoy the mood selector: how it’s organized into the four quadrants, the colors and shapes, and the definitions of emotions.   The only this I really wish it had was an ability to edit and organize the answers in the What Are You Doing and Who Are You With questions. I wish I could alphabetize them or arrange them how I want. I also would love to be able to edit existing categories, like changing the word “pets” to my dog’s name for example without losing the data I already have under “pets”.   But besides that I’m enjoying the rest, plus it’s free and ad free which is the biggest seller on top of just how beautiful and intuitive it is."
4,whaleshark7,"I love this app and how it encourages me to check in with my emotions throughout the day! I also love sharing with friends and getting a glimpse into how their days are going.  My two suggestions would be to have the ability to customize the designation of emotion words, and to be able to add your own.  Often, the word I would use to describe how I’m feeling is not on the matrix, or certain emotions will feel an opposite energy level in my body than what they are categorized in the matrix. For those reasons, the app is not as useful or impactful for me as it could otherwise be… but overall, such an amazing concept and sleek execution! Thank you!"
4,KinzyTheFreak,"I love this app, but I wish there were more emotions. Even if you had to just use the search bar to find them instead of the main emotion screen. Like in awe, heartbroken, melancholy, nothing. The emotions are limited and some have similar definitions so I can’t always find the emotion that fits.   Also for whatever reason every week on my weekly review it always says “you felt the best when you tagged PETS” and I’ve literally never tagged “pets” in any of my logs, so the weekly reviews are disappointing.   You also can’t go back and rewatch weekly reviews. My phone hides the notifications and once Sunday has passed, you can’t see them again. I wish they were stored or logged somehow."
5,moss_cos,This app is so cool. My friend sent it to me and now our little group is all connected in the friends chart so we can check in if needed and also helping to remind us to check in when they do since our moods may have changed! We’re all working through our own stuff at different stages so it’s been really helpful to have to choose a word to describe.   Recommendations:  - more options for mixed feelings. Sometimes I’m physically and emotionally drained but I still feel happy and the chill type Blue options are a little too low energy on that end.   -I wish the photos or voice notes were able to be seen by friends. It’s not a social media but I’d love to show them what makes me happy or give context behind the emotion  ALSO: I’m physically disabled and feel a lot of physical pain which often effects my mood. This app is exactly what I need to track my mental symptoms. I wish I had the exact same thing on another app for physical health symptoms OR physical symptom trackers that operate within this app for those who need or want it
1,Justalittlejellyboi,"I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, made sure everything was updated, and followed general troubleshooting advice - checked internet connection etc. Every time I start over, I’m able to check in with a mood and add a location, activity, and who I’m with to the mood.  After the first check in, I’m never able to add any insight beyond the mood. The screen goes black after selecting my mood every time. I can see that there’s an option to edit past check-ins but  pressing the edit button leads me to a black screen that only prompts me to save without offering the option to edit anything.  The app isn’t really going to help me if I don’t have the ability to add or edit any information on my checkins. I hope this is fixed. This app seems like it’s exactly what I’d need if there weren’t performance breaking bugs"
4,Shan21non,I’ve been using this for a few weeks now. It’s interesting to see the patterns of my moods starting to emerge. There have been times when I know I’m feeling something but I can’t find a word that fits so I’ll choose the closest thing to it. That has been a little frustrating. But my biggest complaint is when I’ve tried to edit a post. When I click on the edit option it brings me to a blank screen with a big save button at the bottom. There are no options at all for me to change anything or even see anything to change. It’s just blank. I wish I knew how to fix that. Maybe it’s a bug that needs to be fixed. Aside from that I like using this.
5,tupperwarelover,"I love love this app! Has been a great way to monitor my emotions through taking different medications and going through big life changes. It’s helped me identify areas in my life I didn’t realize were causing me anxiety through the use of tags. My husband also has it and it’s been a good way for us to communicate how we’re feeling and helps us to know how to approach the other, if they happen to be having a little bit of a rougher day.  Some things I would LOVE to see: being able to look at each of my tags and see the emotions that are associated with them rather than the 6 to 8 most used tags. If there is a place to do this already, I will just keep looking around! It would also be neat if we could add our own emotions; there are so many options describe how we feel in this app, which is great, but sometimes there are emotions that I’m feeling that aren’t an option and none of the other options really quite cut it.  Not big deals though, still five stars and will always recommend!"
4,aes1111111111,"I LOVE this app. I cannot recommend it enough. I love how easy it is to use and how quickly you’re able to log emotions (many apps make you journal every time you log anything, but that’s not the case here).   My only recommendation (question(?)) is that, for some reason, my data doesn’t synch between my devices. I can’t have the app on both my iPad and iPhone because even though I’ll be logged in on both with the same Apple ID, my logs won’t synch between the two devices. I don't know if that’s just a me thing or a bug, but I’d LOVE for that to be resolved or to figure out how to resolve it.    However, the aforementioned isn’t enough of a problem for me to stop using the app!"
5,alexaartis08,"I love this app because of the knowledge I've gained. Even though I took some psychology courses in school, I have learned so much more about emotions and their actual function in our daily lives through How We Feel.   One thing that really stands out is that after reporting an unpleasant emotion, there are videos you can watch that will teach you how to approach the situation of having an unpleasant emotion. I was reluctant to watch them, because I thought they were going to be fluffy, feel good things. But I was wrong about this, the videos often genuinely help me when I'm in a unpleasant and uncomfortable space."
5,Sages G Love,"This app is made so beautifully, and with such care, I can’t help but admire it. I love the unique shapes for every feeling. I love how they are catagorized. I love that my inner circle and I can let each other in and be vulnerable and supportive of each other. There are lessons that you can skip, but should you choose to watch it, they aren’t very long videos. When a long video would become overwhelming or cumbersome, that aspect is convenient. I love this app 🥹 my family loves this app, I really hope you love this app. It’s also free by donations, and what the heck, that’s just so neat, humans can be so wonderful to each other."
4,jeelli05,"I’ve been using the app for a week and am enjoying the user experience, videos, and tips. It’s very easy to navigate.  For features, however, I wish I had the option to add more than two emotions to one check in.  I’m usually feeling 3 to 5 at any check-in.  It’s inconvenient to complete a check-in and then immediately do another one to capture all the emotions of one moment.  Maybe this is a feature that could be adjusted in settings, allowing users to choose a minimum or maximum number of emotions, or to set it to limited or unlimited.  I also submitted this feedback via email through the settings the app."
5,Pickledbeans94,"Easy to understand, and easy to navigate. Lots of different words for complex emotions, the ability to combine emotions when you’re feeling a mixture of things, and all kinds of mood tracking data. There’s even a “meh” emotion for the moments you’re just feeling meh, and don’t know what else to call it. It’s great. I genuinely was shocked that it’s free; it’s amazing that this was entirely funded by donations. This kind of generosity honestly gives me a little bit of hope.❤️❤️❤️ The only thing I don’t like is sometimes it crashes, but it’s not often, nor could that possibly justify knocking off a star. Seriously love this."
5,heat_rj,"All I have to say is wow! I love this app! It’s helping my marriage so much to understand my feelings and my spouse. Whenever we see each other’s check-in, we both know how one may be feeling and it encourages me to act upon those feelings in the best way possible. Thank you for an amazing app. Although, I’m not able to read my spouse’s check-in notes for a feeling. She’ll type a note and I would love to read them as she would vise-versa. I love the idea of flipping a feeling that is shared, like flipping a card, though I’m unable to see what her note was for that feeling. Is this something that could possibly be fixed?"
4,czmaines,"I love how much data I can see in this app! Great aesthetics, love love all the graph breakdowns... overall great app idea and it makes my heart happy  This might have to do with my iPhone (SE 2020) but I've been finding some features to be a bit buggy, specifically: — in the ""analyze"" section sometimes the different sections overlap and I can't see the full category breakdown (e.g. the ""what you were doing"" and ""who you were with"" sections both overlap with the sections beneath them so I can only see the top 4 categories before it becomes unreadable) — when I track my cycle or hours of sleep, only some categories show up in the graph breakdown, or it doesn't log correctly"
5,Cae-In <3,"I have been seeking an app that provides a plethora of options (versus a scale from very happy to very down), has evidence-based techniques/information, and is free of paywalls. This one fits the bill!! As a therapist for adolescents, I am very excited to share this with them as a way for them to track their feelings and the variables surrounding their feelings.   Additionally, I have enjoyed it so much that I have been using it for myself!   My only suggestion for improving the app would be to allow the option for selecting a few emotions at the same time. Otherwise, I truly love this app after 4 days of use."
5,Well this is great 372649,"This app is gorgeous and is also very helpful in aiding me to better understand and process my emotions. It has a very useful feature which is called “surprise me” so it send a notification at a random time to check in instead of at the same time each day which I really like.   Additionally the content is very useful and it suggest different activities based on what emotion you selected. Eg time outside or kindness meditation.   Finally, this has to be one of the most visually aesthetic apps I’ve ever used and I’m VERY picky. The fact that something so high quality is free is absolutely incredible."
4,Scale2025,"I LOVE this app. I shared it with my therapist who didn’t know about it, and then she ended up sharing it with her other patients and it’s really awesome. I really like the new update with all the sounds, I’m definitely going to be using that while doing my homework. I think it’s nice that the feelings are defined, especially when I don’t know the right word for what exactly I’m feeling. However, sometimes I don’t feel positive or negative and there are no feelings that describe being in between those two. It’s never high energy when I feel in between, it’s always low energy. I think that would make this app really beneficial."
5,naniknowsdesign,"Truth be told I’m not very good at inputting data. Every time the app tells me to, but this app has empowered me to focus on the emotions I feel in the events leading up to those emotions. Like What? The best thing about this app is that it’s free, completely free. It’s almost unheard of that an app that helps and focuses on peoples emotions are free and without subscriptions. We are blessed to have people and nonprofits that strive to provide access to apps like this, because honestly, I’ve had reflected on how much time I actually do self care for myself. I love this app and would recommend it to anyone whether it’s an adult or a child to use this."
5,Ilove_rose888,I really love this app at first I thought I had to pay for some features such as to unlock some lessons but no you don’t even get adds I love that it also give me a bunch of feelings to choose it makes it easier to understand what I’m feeling and it give me recommended tips when ur feeling a specific feeling I also like that it keeps a tracks on patterns such as how you felt in what weather what you was doing and even if you were around someone and I love the fact that you can type how u feeling that day and the situation I feel like it’s my little personal journal really love this app
5,KairaHolland,"Have been enjoying this app so much since my therapist recommended it to me. I love that it’s free, there’s nothing pushing you to pay for a premium version every time you open the app, and it’s straightforward and pleasing to use!   One thing I would love to see is a completely “neutral” option right in the middle of the emotion selection. I often find myself wanting to log an emotion for the day but truly not feeling anything other than just “whatever.” I’ve been using the “meh” emotion for this most days, but it feels a little more on the negative side of things than how I really feel."
5,Kate Delgado,"This app was recommended by one of my family and relationship professors to try out, so my friends and I who are in the same class all downloaded it to take it for a spin. It has be so awesome. The “friends” feature has allowed all of us to have better insight on how each other are feeling in real time. I feel like because of that, I’m better able to communicate with them and help them.   It’s also just be so nice for myself to have a time and place where I can stop and sift through emotions to really pin point how I’m feeling. My head seems clearer since getting the app."
5,babyjackrabbit6,"I downloaded it a week ago because my mood has been all over the place and I can’t afford therapy. The trackers have so many insightful metrics, there are so many emotions to choose from, and there are so many FREE resources. There are visual breathing exercises, thoughtfully made guidance/reframing videos, and so much more. This app makes checking in FUN. There’s no catch. There are no ads. There is no option to upgrade. You get everything! I told my partner and she is using it too! It’s so user friendly, fun, and engaging to use. If you can’t afford therapy, this is a step in a positive direction."
5,Pierre_8003,"I really love this app, but I have found one bug. When I modify anything on an entry that is not the most recent one, it changes the more recent entries’ sleep time. Sometimes, it adds the sleep times of the entries, sometimes it comes back to zero and sometimes it randomly changes the time. It’s irritating, as it’s tedious to fix the sleep times of each and every entry of the day every time I modify one of them, in order to get proper stats, and it happens everyday! I’m still giving it five stars because it is an aesthetic, useful and complete app."
5,KFry101,This app gives you so many tools and it’s so accessible. So many apps like this hide features under a premium charge and the fact that this one doesn’t is such a relief and makes me not feel guilty about taking care of myself. Highly recommend this to anyone who needs an app to help track or just vent out there feelings. I personally love the burning negativity because you get to actually feel like you’re burning a piece of paper with your negative thoughts on it but it’s digital and it’s so fun.
5,How I feel🐇,"Great app with one major flaw: there is no way to select multiple emotions in a single check-in. This is a problem for me personally because, as a human being, I can experience multiple emotions simultaneously, and in order to enter everything I feel, I must check in multiple times. I would really like to have the option of selecting several emotions added at once. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has this issue.  Aside from that, this is an excellent app, I love it."
5,CeJayCeLove,I’m not good with keeping journals or keeping track of my emotions but this app has allowed me to get so much better at being aware of how I feel and keep track of how certain people or situations impact me. I’ve added my partner and friends and it’s so nice to be able to get little updates in their emotional well-being in such a simple and nonintrusive manner.   The only change I wish to see is the section on menstrual impact. The amount of flow is not as important as the stage of the cycle. I’d rather it be aware of the timeline of a 28 day cycle to better see at which stages my emotions fluctuate.
5,perfect experience,I've used many mood tracker/logs and this is by far the best one I've found. And that is not including the fact that it's free. That just makes it all the more better. The only suggestion I would make is to be able to select more than one feeling during check-in. I know having to pick just one forces me to really look at how I feel but the human brain is complex so there are definitely times when just one feeling doesn't completely convey how I feel. Even with only being able to pick just one feeling I still love this app.
3,MehdiTourari,"To keep this review short & sweet, this is a great app, great graphics & visuals, a creative way to connect with people through your emotional status, my suggestions to make this app much better in that department is to enable more access to your emotion data inside the app with the people you want share them with, access to your daily, monthly data to stay in touch, it was one of my issues initially because as soon as a friend submits an emotion, the one before gets erased automatically without any history to go back to, so more access to your emotional data & a history feature would be great! Lastly adding more emotions to be more specific with our wording."
5,dehlz,"Everything is so simple and easy to digest within the app. Checking in is a breeze. I also love that there are no pesky in-app purchases shoved down users throats (hopefully it stays this way). My one point of feedback is regarding notifications - it would be wonderful to have an option of 'random' notification check-ins since it would give a truer sense of how we are feeling throughout any given day. When I have to set a specific time for a notification to show up, it feels like I have a preconceived emotion/feeling I check-in with each day."
4,ShannonUM,"I got this app based on a recommendation from a book I read and I am loving it. It’s beautiful, user friendly, and I love the lessons and videos each day. I have it 4 stars because I would love to see the friends feature improve. I really like that you can choose for friends to be notified about what you’re feeling. I think this could be improved by showing more than the latest check in from each person within the app, notifications where friends react or are able to comment on your check ins, and maybe even a chat or group chat feature would be beneficial I feel!"
5,carolinesgma,I love this. I am trying to get my grown children and Grandchildren on board too. It helps me. I spend a lot of time alone. I never received any type of therapy in my life even when I should have. I grew up in a family where we just didn’t talk about our issues. This is a little therapy for me. It gives you a chance to stop and think about your feelings and why you’re feeling a certain way. I like to push on all the emotions and read the definitions lol. I think I have experienced them all many times. You must try this app. What do you have to lose?
5,cabbettsu,"This is a beautifully designed app— the user interface is engaging, is visually both simple and unique, and is a great app designed to foster real life friendships. This doesn’t feel like social media; it’s a tool for communication.  That being said, the app had some weird features; the having to share feelings with friends after you already did it in the app adding friends is a little complicated to get to; i love the feature that you have to be intentional with who you’re showing the nudging system is playful and also good  the intentionality of the app and the meaning of it doesn’t match with emojis lol maybe own emoticons?? logistically why save the negative messages from the best self tools fire game?? like doesn’t that negate the entire point of the exercise?? i now have “i am awkward” just sitting at the top of my tool page lol  pros  beautiful design the intentionality the effort beautiful calm design The production value is very clear"
5,Rose Covington,"I love this app. as someone who will go through many emotions in a single day, it has been very useful. you basically log your emotions. my favorite points are: the layout is simple, bold, easy to use. there are definitions under each emotion. the app builds multiple charts based on variables (such as activities, sleep, fitness) selected by you. you can add a note when you log an emotion, which could essentially be used as a journal entry. there are videos that teach and give insight on emotions - a learning center. there are no ads, and no in-app purchases; the app is totally free."
5,ZOMBOT_YT,"I love the app and have no quarrels with it! I was thinking though that when viewing a friends emotion check in that being able to read the same descriptions we see under the emotions when we check in would help us get a better understanding of what they are feeling because I don’t always remember the exact descriptions of the emotions. So instead of just viewing the word Tranquil we could also see the “peaceful, free from tension” description below it. Thanks for taking time to read this review and I hope you agree!"
5,TdM-TX,"Got this app after listening to Yale Center’s Mark Brackett on a podcast. This is an amazing tool for emotional awareness and building emotional intelligence. This is NOT intended to focus more on emotions, but explore and understand them—from emotion judge to emotion scientist, as they put it. The interface is appealing and inviting as a collect/understand interface; the addition of tools and information is a strength. I have suggested it to adults with issues with dependency issues (self, others) and plan on introducing to my teen and young adult kids. Again, an absolute value add for optimizing wellness."
5,mattjohnson3,"I’ve tried so many other mood-tracking apps out there and none of them have been as well-designed and worked as incredibly as this one. Not only is the app itself beautifully designed and intuitive, it is also completely free to use. Almost every other app locks most of its features behind a subscription but this one offers all of its breadth and content at no charge. I very rarely write App Store reviews but I had to come here and just give a thumbs up to the health and tech teams behind this amazing product!"
5,billy on the beat,"Great app overall, very useful for tracking the transient nature of emotions. Consider adding a feature to create/add new emotions that are outside of the list already provided(for example I’d love to log the feeling of “nothing”, which is different from “empty” as “empty” implies lack but “nothing” is just a sensation with no attached connotation). And while I appreciate the four quadrants (high pleasant, high unpleasant, low pleasant, low unpleasant) I think we can push it further and detach from the label of pleasant/unpleasant- after all feelings are exactly that - feelings."
4,Anon Anna,"Hi, this app has helped me so much the last two months. And it’s completely free! I love that I can track my moods throughout the day and say how many hours I’ve slept. One issue I have run into though- I stay up until about 1-2am and I like to do a check in before I go to bed. This check in counts for this new day that has freshly started and I haven’t actually slept yet. However, your sleep time is set to be the same for every check in for a 24 hour period. Idk, I just feel like it makes my first check in each day less accurate. But still absolutely my favorite app for mental health."
5,um_olive,"So many things about this app are great and lead me to keep using it. First of all, it’s free and there aren’t any annoying in app purchases to unlock more content. There are helpful videos and strategies for everything at no extra charge. I also love the interface. It feels clean and easy to use. For people who use their smartphones everyday, there’s really no learning curve. And I’m just generally loving tracking my moods and what’s going on around me when I feel a certain way. Truly trying to become an emotion scientist instead of an emotion judge!!!!"
5,Sognatore1988,"My wife and I originally downloaded this to keep in touch with how we were feeling and it helped us a lot. We then decided to have the kids download it and use it as tool for them to keep in touch with their emotions and learn to better understand what the emotions meant. I would like to see a couple new features (selecting unlimited emotions for when you’re feeling a bunch at once and can identify them, and being able to share an emotion update with one person and a different one with another)"
5,CaliRya,"I’m a few days in and so far I’m loving this app. It’s incredibly easy to just dive right in, with just a few spare minutes a day. The design is really slick and simple. Even though the videos are usually way too fast for me to absorb all the great thoughts and ideas, I appreciate they can be slowed down. The written summary at the end is a great touch. Privacy-wise, I appreciate that my data is stored on my iPhone, not in the app’s cloud servers. I encountered very few bugs. At first the app was letting me in without a Face ID prompt, but now it’s all working as expected."
5,courtandspark86,"Hello, I really REALLY need to use this app daily and throughout the day, however, there is no way for me to get cell service while teaching at school. Schools block certain services, or perhaps it’s the cell phone company that does that. Anyway, I would have to leave my classroom and go outside, and sometimes I need to go to my car, in order to use my cell service. I can’t just leave my kids to do that. We are SUCH a vulnerable population that deals with student issues first, and it leaves little time to take care of ourselves. Many teachers are so depressed and anxious, and I know that this app would help so many of us. Is there a way to have an offline option or a website for logging feelings?  Who else can I reach out to about this? It’s a country wide issue guaranteed. Thank you and I look forward to hearing back and speaking with someone soon. -Mrs. Cameron Boisvert"
5,ChristineWN,"I’m diagnosed with BPII, however cycles are so rare that I didn’t recognize it was happening.   My therapist assigned me the task of tracking my moods & I chose this app because I liked what I read about your project.   I’m two weeks in and I’m amazed. This is the best app/method ever. Bonus points for crunching LOTS of data in a simple visual way. I’m seeing my therapist next week and will have her look into this & perhaps recommending to other clients.  One TINY fix needed. Sorry to put it in a review, but I can’t find a way to contact support. In the ANALYZE/WEEKLY/Your emotions during the week….the chart is populating one day ahead. Today is Tuesday, but Wednesday is reflecting today’s check-ins. The chart begins with Monday. If it began with Sunday, it would work.  Overall, fantastic app, the needed fix doesn’t impact the usage at all, so I’m 100% happy with it. Thank you for a much-needed method and for making it free. Bless you."
5,J_Thrasher1,"I’ve never been too fluent with my emotions and this app has been so much more helpful than I had ever expected. A friend recommended it to me and as soon as I saw that each emotion had a description I fell in love. As a guy I kinda know what all of those emotions meant but, being able to see them in their distinct categories with descriptions has allowed me to understand my feelings MUCH better. I haven’t been using the app for too long but I am also very excited to start using the analyze section to look for patterns!"
5,besiendodnsns,"This app is like my fitness pal for mental and emotional health. I love the data visualizations and the design so much. I completely trust this app to help me identify my feelings, define them, and work through them. I’ve been telling all my friends about this and will share it with my coworkers as well.  It’s a great alternative to doom scrolling on social media or trauma dumping on friends. I can just open the app, check in with my feelings very quickly and be done. It’s a simple, yet cathartic feeling that takes little to no effort to stay consistent with."
5,lulusdn,"I’ve been using this app for months now and it really gives me an insight on my emotions and how well my mental health is and ways to improve it. It has helped me become more aware of my emotions and truly helped me practice checking in on myself and my feelings. I seriously recommend this app as it continuously updates emotions and adds new ones and it improved to the better and I appreciate such helpful app thats for free, no ads, nor subscription.  Thank you so much for this wonderful app, grateful for such innovative mental health awareness/support."
5,The Real Guapo,"When I have the urge to pick up my phone, instead of scrolling on Instagram or playing mindless games, I check in with my feelings with How We Feel. My therapist reccommended it to me and I love it! It is so satisfying with the colors and shapes of the emotions and there are so many emotions to choose from. I like that I can track patterns of my emotions and see how often they change throughout the day. I also really enjoy the informational videos and tools the app has. Would 10/10 recommend this app and I am so grateful that it is free!"
4,St. Elvira,"I started using this app about a week ago to track my moods. I find that most of the time the 4 energy levels to choose from hardly match the description of my moods. For example I’m jittery but I’m not feeling high energy but in order to select that feeling I have to choose high energy. It would be helpful if you could choose your energy level and then allow users to choose from all the pre-listed feelings whether they correspond to each of the listed energy levels or not. Other than that, the app is really helpful."
5,madhavvv_s,"I LOVE THIS APP!!! I have ADHD and apps like this designed for self-help don’t tend to usually be as fun to use as this one! The UI interface and design is sooooooo visually appealing to the point where i’m almost excited to track my emotions 2x a day- and I’m NOT someone that loves to feel my feelings. I love how easy, simple, and effective this app is. The variety of emotions offered and the little description under each one help me really articulate what i’m feeling as i normally have trouble really identifying what exactly i’m feeling. THANK YOU FOR THIS"
5,olivia12,"I’ve used lots and lots of self help apps, and I’m confident in saying that this one is my favorite.  The UI is simple but engaging, the terms are intuitive and really do help in my unraveling my true feelings. I love the analytics it provides.  I also appreciate how this is backed by researchers and supported by donation, it’s tough to put money up for apps relating to self help when I’m already paying for therapy/psychiatrist/etc. And this app really feels like a labor of love unconcerned with making a profit off its users.  I’ll definitely be making a donation!  1 consideration, I’ve had difficulty syncing my menstrual data to this. I use a separate app, which connects to Apple health, which in turn connects to this app, but it hasn’t fully synced together yet. Not a dealbreaker and something that might need to be re-set or something. But all in all an amazing app and highly recommended!!!"
5,Tanya1140,I really am enjoying this app. It’s nice that I’m able to find the way I’m feeling through a choice of options. It’s helpful since sometimes I find it difficult to find the word. It’s super easy to use and helpful. I’ve been able to pinpoint what triggers my moods by using this app over the past couple months. It tracks it by the places you are and who you’re with and what you’re doing. I absolutely encourage everyone to use this app since it helps you become aware of your mental health triggers.
4,Razzmatazz11,"I was only introduced to this app 2 days ago and it’s been so helpful. My number one hiccup is I cannot ID my feelings. I just draw blanks.  This app is cool because it gives definitions of the feelings and I’ll just be scrolling through and I recognize something and it fits. I had no idea I was feeling so many things. I know that sounds dumb, but feelings were not validated when I was growing up, you shoved them away.   The tools are proving to be helpful. I’ve only just begun to explore, but the sounds section is fascinating in that you can create your own music. I get mesmerized and it helps me to relax.   My one suggestion that I offer is that during check ins we need space to select more than 2 feelings. Given that ability and I’d give this app 5 stars in a heartbeat. I sent an email to the creators and they’ve already responded and that was nice.   And the app is really free free. No leveling up, no subscriptions. The app is a godsend."
5,Jessie_Smith19,"I love everything about this app, from the simple and colorful design to the concept of learning to watch and track your emotions. The app is so well design and user Freud my that you don’t even need instructions to start….it is self explanatory. I also really love that it is a non-profit app funded by donations!  Personally, I’ve been trying to learn more about my emotions and feelings for years. This app, and it’s ease of use, are undoubtedly going to help me get to a better place of understanding myself and therefore the world.  Thank you for this app!!!!!"
5,lausyreviewer,"Really enjoy the simple interface for emotion descriptors and the corresponding coping strategies/tools as well as the community aspect. One of my friends checked in as “disappointed” and when I messaged her to see what was going on, she said, “wow this app really works.” It’s a great way to stay connected to close friends.   My suggestion for further improvement would be to allow for multiple feelings to be selected at once, as I’ve had times where I held both positive and negative emotions at the same time."
5,Upset-Vet,"I am honestly pretty shocked at how big of a difference simply keeping track of my emotions through the day has made. I find myself checking in with my inner workings far more often than I would typically. Instead of assuming I feel down just because, I’ve noticed myself implementing certain actions to help improve my mood. Frankly, I’m impressed. I downloaded this on a whim, but I think it’s a keeper. I considered myself to be a relatively emotionally intelligent person, but this app really encourages me to hold space for what I’m experiencing. A+"
5,Joda990,"I like the ability to do random reminders to get more varied data.  I like the organization of the feelings since surrounding feelings are all related and often used as synonyms, so that helps me to get a sense of what feelings often go together and be more specific.  I wish there was a section for a true gratitude journal in the app too, so I could consolidate my mindfulness apps, but if that would detract from the mission of HWF then I much rather the great attention to detail the have put into their existing features."
5,DonCarreto,"I have been working on being connected to my emotions, more aware of my thinking thought patterns and feelings. This is my third day of using the application and the results are amazing! My favorites are the daily scheduled emotion check-in and the small video with a short explanation from the experts while providing simple tools or quick exercise to help you cope with negative and positive emotions. My favorite personal edd evelopment app who knew feeling was so much fun?! Already recommended to couple of friends. Thank you HWF!!"
5,Blakebrands,"After a series of events caused my mental and emotional states to deteriorate into a very dark and dangerous place, I didn’t think I could go on living my life in a way that would be good or even tolerable. I lost my dad, my stepdad, and my favorite aunt in a single year. It was the worst time in my life and I had no desire to participate in life. I didn’t look for help, ask for it or even consider.l it. Thankfully, this app found me. The teachings, the affirmations, the journal entries all helped me learn and understand my emotions and what exactly they mean.   B"
5,Grape_Jelly23,"This application has helped me so much. Whenever I feel a negative or even positive emotion I log it into the app and it helps me feel so much better. The various different charts allow me to discover ways to feel better about myself and current situation.  The mediation and breathing exercises help as well, because they provide guidance and there is a sense of customizable by putting your different exercises into favorites.   Overall this app has transformed many aspects in my life, and it’s completely free."
4,Yeika21,"I love this app! It’s so satisfying scrolling to find what i’m feeling at the moment. I also absolutely love that you guys explain every feeling because it can teach me to communicate better, but also because my 1st language is not english.  However, there’s this glitch that’s very annoying… Every time I check in a feeling and I write, as soon as I stop writing the screen goes black and it won’t let me do anything. Ig I have to edit something, I have to close the app and open again just to edit… Every time! Hope you guys can fix this, other than that, the app is amazing!"
4,Albertoeda97,"The headline is: This is a great app. It is helpful to explore the grid of emotions to find a more precise word to express what you feel. This has helped me question what I feel exactly, and why it might be. Just looking at the list has made me wonder why some of these emotions are missing in my life, and that reflection has helped me to lean into more positive emotions.  There is only one thing that actually bothers me about the app: The lessons are overly cinematic, almost epic, and they feel out of place, inauthentic. I would prefer a more familiar, natural approach to the same script."
5,chrissy tn,"Really great app, love the concept of it. Strategies are super helpful, and the app itself i very user-friendly. Been recommending it to everyone.    BUT — issue is that when I go back to any previous emotion check-ins to edit the exercise hours, ALL my recorded checkins (literally since the very first checkin I’ve had with the app) automatically turns to 45 minutes (weird). Then it also makes all my previous sleep logs 5 hours. Completely throws off the accuracy of the overall analysis chart overviews."
5,Walk with me.dawn,"My youngest son recently invited our family to join him on the How I Feel App and share our emotions with each other with a daily check in. This app provides emotional connection, personal and interpersonal,  and short instructional videos that teach how to assess your emotions, and techniques to reduce anxiety and stress for good self-care.  You will also find online journaling and help-lines for mental health support within ‘How I Feel’ app. It is an excellent resource for maintaining good health in Mind and Body. I  am grateful for the creators of How I Feel."
4,Smileashx3,"The app is wonderful to use so far, and I really enjoy my experience when I remember to use it. Yes, the app does let you set the notifications to come as daily reminders, and I even appreciate the “surprise me at a random time option”. However, once I open my phone, the banner is gone and there’s no badges to indicate a notification on the app icon. I need that little red number to remind me to check in if I ignore the banner, and I believe I would check in more if the notifications were more prominent. Great app nonetheless!"
4,Kiwiiiii2005,"Would love to see more interaction from the developers with the community using there app. I’ve seen no feedback in these reviews from developers to there community, and very little improvement from the community complaints. Would love to see a feature to add or create your own emotions along with the color they are associated with. Maybe a feature to share those emotions with freinds. Another issue I have is wanting to add a feeling to days I missed, even if it doesn’t keep the streak going I should be able to log my emotions for that day."
4,Asaskew,"I absolutely love this app. It really helps me be more present throughout the day and mindful of how I’m feeling. I like the fact that you can track how you feel at certain times of the day, doing different activities, or who you are with.   With that said; I think the feelings to choose from should reflect the popular “feelings wheel.” I feel the four categories is limiting to what the true human experience is. There definitely is more nuance to feelings than just low/high energy & pleasant/unpleasant. Please add more categories of feelings!"
5,Nefezuri,"This has truly been a tool that I look forward to using daily. In my life I have suffered with bouts of depression either due to needed surgeries or drastic life changes. I didn’t have a tool to help with this until now. I am grateful for the ingenuity & creation of this app with its helpful tools & a way to help me in monitoring my emotions/feelings. I was looking for something like this to help me,this year with December Holidays. I now feel empowered with the tools I have at my fingertips.   In Gratitude, A (PS-shout out to Bruce Muzik@“Love at First Fight” for the intro to this app)"
5,NekoEsmahh,"Are you able to add a feature where you ask us questions and challenges every day? Like a little prompt area that engages us to write about something. I find myself not using the app as often for the lack of initiative. Maybe you guys could help?  And challenges could be something like going or doing stuff that will make us feel a certain way, I guess. Maybe even take a picture or record it to have a little memory of it for the future."
5,Ranch Smoothie,"I am autistic, and struggle with recognizing my feelings due to years of masking. This app has helped me in ways I didn’t even know I needed help. Everyone I have recommended the app to also greatly enjoys the app, even the people who aren’t on the spectrum. Emotions can be hard to notice patterns with; this app has helped me learn the patterns of my feelings and behaviors so I can make the proper adjustments to feel more validated and fulfilled. I can’t recommend this app enough! It’s the best app I have ever downloaded."
5,han1banan,"This app has been a breath of fresh air. I’ve been using it for as little under a week now; and I absolutely love  it! It’s easy to use and I love how I’m drawing more awareness to my emotions with each check in. I already feel at ease. Feelings come and go, and that’s such a nice thing to acknowledge. I can’t wait to keep using this app! They did a great job making it, and I feel honored to be a part of it. Definitely download and start using it today! You won’t be disappointed, you’ll love it."
4,Danashmore,"Love this app - it has really helped me recognize that when I feel ‘unpleasant’ it won’t last forever. A few suggestions/comments: 1. In the ‘analyze’ section, where it has the 7 vertical bars, for some reason it has Sunday all the way to the right, even though it is the first day of the week. 2. it would be really nice for those bars to indicate the emotions felt throughout the day chronologically rather than just stacking them by frequency. 3. The sleep field does not read automatically, so I have to add it each day."
4,Your dry,"So I been using this app for like 3 years now. I don’t use is everyday but I go through tons where I will use it everyday for a few weeks and then not use it again for a few weeks. Just in and off. I like that this app doesn’t make me feel guilty for how I feel. I LOVE the ‘reflect’ and ‘affirmations’ addition. It really helps me feel so much better especially because I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel in real life. It is nice to get feedback and support, even if it is chat gpt. It’s really helpful. I hope they keep improving."
5,Riot :),This app has been very helpful for remember to be present when I’m having an emotion as an Audhd person this is really difficult especially because my adhd will kick in so I forget I have the feeling once i notice it which isn’t great. So this app has been helpful because it gives me a designated amount place to put the feeling when im having it instead of panicking and not knowing what to do with it.   I do wish there were a widget for it so it’d be a bigger tile on my phone
5,Frank01346,I love this app! My therapist recommended this to me and I love it because it helps me keep track of what I’m feeling and any patterns and it’s easy to use. However I do have one suggestion. I wish that you could set up different times for different days because I have different schedules for each day and I am not up on the weekends when my reminder goes off to check in and I can’t set it later because I have school at that time I want to set it but I love the app and keep up the great work!
5,MK17081!,"I have been using this app for about a year now and absolutely love how it works. It is so easy for me to be able to see how much of 1 color I experience in a month and helps me understand what color I mostly stay in. I even have my dad using the app now so we can have better communicate and when I go to my therapy sessions I now have a way I can talk about things that are going on because I can now look back and see what I wrote. I even have my therapist using it and she has even told some of her other clients about it.  I do however have a mini complaint. When I want to upload a photo when you get to the part where you can. I wish there was a way to change the color of the text, so it could show up better when there is a picture that was taken in the daytime.  Otherwise, would totally recommend!!"
5,merylstreep is my mom,"Highly, highly recommend. I couldn’t write a better review for an app. This app has been a life changer and has seriously saved me. It’s given me a safe space to not only identify the sometimes difficult emotions that I’m feeling, but it helps me put them into words, which is crucial when processing trauma and hard (or big happy) life events. The analyzation tools included in the app allow you to see patterns over time, and honestly, I wish I had just found this sooner!"
3,Madds-G,"I like this app a lot. It’s helped me put words to my emotions and works as a processing tool that later helps me when I’m discussing my feelings with someone else. The interface is clean and creative. The app organizes information in a format that is easy to digest and understand.   However, the emotions that are available are sometimes too broad to fully capture with one word. I wish that there were more available options that sit on the fence between categories (e.g., bittersweet). There have been multiple occasions where the words don’t feel like the right label for my emotional state."
4,ml897,"I love this! Me and my partner use it and we share how we feel. It’s also so beneficial to have a wide range of emotions and to be able to track how you feel, when, with who, doing what, etc. it helps show patterns in how we feel.   However, I would like even more emotions and an option to add new ones. Also, identifying emotions is difficult and I love that the emotions are split up into four groups, but I wish there was an option to help identifying emotions even more (ex. If you have a low mood, do you feel more sadness or tiredness)"
5,M. E. Alvarez,"I found this app November of last year and introduced it to my friends, since we were all going through a pretty hard time. We’ve loved the app ever since, and I’ve even introduced it to my parents. But theres o e bug I noticed and I have no idea if it’s just my phone bugging out. The Even-Tempered icon keeps changing randomly throughout the day, and when I look at the Analyze tab, it has no icon because it has no specific icon. It drives me slightly insane. Is it just me?"
5,Chondrion,"I have a hard time expressing and naming my emotions. This helps a lot. The only suggestions/requests that I would have is to allow for multiple emotions in the same check in (sometimes I’m feeling accomplished, but also a bit irritated) and ability to use a watch app for logging emotions as I don’t have access to my phone during my work day, but do have my watch.  Edit: I was reading other reviews and noticed that 2 are possible at the same time. :-)"
5,blueraffa,"Where one would expect this program to fall flat, it is actually a lesson in revelation. Understanding your feelings is powerful. Understanding your feelings change is meaningful. Understanding how often they do is revealing: through videos and guides this is truly a program that unlocks you to be a better you by allowing you insights into your yourself that are relevant and will give you a better balance  going forward. Deceptively simple. Incredibly powerful. A must have app."
3,Universe Observer,"21 Jul 2023 - I have been using this on and off for over a week, generally two entries a day.  The biggest issue I have is that the app suffers from crashes almost every time I use it and the crashes do not seem to be device dependent.  It occurs on the iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro 12.9” Gen 3 and Gen 5 devices, all of which are on OS 16.5.1(c).  I am still trying to figure out why weather and sleep entries are required as they do not seem to have relative value that is correlated to the condition that you feel you are in.  I know that they should have some bearing; but there is no physical correlation in the graph related reports."
5,catinapastlife,"The fact that this is a FREE resource is absolutely amazing. And it’s so needed for so many people. It helps you name what you’re feeling, and then asks you questions  that help you get to the root of those feelings. Being able to do that is a SKILL. And it’s one that most people don’t have. So I’m so grateful for this app and the work that so many wonderful people put in to bring it to life.   Imagine that: helping others just because you can. Many blessings to all who helped make this app."
3,gewn_,"its a lot less familiar than other emotion tracking apps. but ive slowly started using it and enjoying it over the last few weeks. i had decided to use this as my main emotional tracking app, but after i had an amazing night without my phone on hand i was disappointed to find out you cant add an emotion for a previous day. i was very high energy pleasant (which has been difficult for me to achieve lately) and i want credit for it! i'll continue looking for a better emotion tracker until this app adds that feature. this app would be 5 stars with it"
3,Kjralon,"I really struggle with emotional regulation. I’m a big represser and suppresser. This app does help me identify my emotions more easily, but it does not help me pick strategies or tools to best deal with the current emotion I’m experiencing. It used to actually recommend tools based on the emotion I chose; now, I don’t get any recommendations for tools, and I feel lost when looking at the Tools tab because I don’t know what tool to use with which emotions. This has honestly led to me using the app less because it doesn’t feel like I’m learning techniques to manage and navigate all the way through my feelings."
5,Nellesroh,"This app is so amazing! It has benefited my desire to process my emotions a bit faster and understand where I feel them in my body by a landslide! I feel so much more in tune with my emotions and feel like I am making more space for myself. It’s empowering to be able to check in with yourself and just allow emotions to ebb and flow without judgement, I also enjoy that you can see all the patterns involved! I can’t race enough about this app! The setup is just SO perfect and user friendly! Love, love, love!"
5,HistoricalAverage,"This app is extremely sophisticated. I use it to journal. It makes important data legible, it comes with tools to support self affirmations, and as seen in the details jt has a beautiful emotions interface that is fun to explore. In creating an app that is extremely streamlined to use, the developers have helped me keep in touch with my emotions, given me a privacy-conscious way to store important textual diary entries, and overall earned a place in my home screen that I never knew needed to be there."
5,kati3kat,"Way better than the new one that Apple integrated into IOS17. I have been using the app for 108 days straight and have loved exploring the many emotions to choose from. Love the graphs and reports. Just wish there was a messaging feature for when friends are struggling and need to be checked on. I do like the ability to use multiple emotions, read about what each emotion is and find even more in the search tab. It really is the best app for moods and emotions."
5,Golfcat1,"The very first benefit that I had from using the How We Feel app help me identify exactly how I’m feeling, when because sometimes my feelings got very down with my lack of linguistic proficiency the first time I use the specific identification of a feeling was when I expressed disappointment disappointment that a friend with the company me on a dance night it felt good. It felt like I was in charge of my self and was taking care of myself and and letting others know exactly how I feel."
5,marierousseau,"I enjoy this app very much. I like the specific choices for my emotions instead of a general “happy” or “sad”.  The need to actually reflect on how I feel has greatly improved my ability to communicate them.  I would like to see an Apple Watch version and perhaps emotions that relate to illness? Sometimes when I’m sick I’m in pain. There is a choice for malaise, but the definition doesn’t include a general feeling of unwellness.   Thank you for this app. It is truly helpful."
5,MUOTU,"I’m grateful for this app. It’s easy to use, the plethora of emotions included in the choices is helpful. I like that I don’t really have to just be four of the “feelings” listed. Once it opens up, what lies beneath are many viable choices for the emotions I’m experiencing that fall on a spectrum. I think the pause I take to check in through the day is time I deserve to take for myself, and it’s super quick. The tutorials, the data, the analytics offer a great opportunity to be present with self."
5,YaaYaa16,"This app has made handling the feelings of anxiety much more doable. After I started using it, I realized the source of the anxiety I was feeling each day. Now I don’t feel much anxiety at all which is saying a lot for me as a new mom. Being able to find different words with such detail to describe what I’m feeling has helped me so much in my day to day life. I’ve referred this app to at-least 4 friends and we all share our emotions together daily (including my mother). I’m so happy with this app."
5,Evster2.0,"There are many more good things to say about this app than “bad” things. I like that it makes me think about how I’m feeling… maybe sounds weird to some ppl, but that’s just how I feel (pun-intended). I also like how we can connect with friends on it if we want to. One suggestion… it’d be nice to be able to click more than one feeling. Sometimes I’d pick one, other times I’d pick two, and know what I meant if I were to look back at it.  eg: Spent/Restless or Exhausted/Comfortable."
5,Sandfly86,"I wasn’t sure what I thought about this app when my daughter shared it with me, but I am loving it!  It has been good for me to consider how I’m feeling and why. It’s very centering and helps me be less judgmental towards myself. I also enjoy the videos that encourage learning from all emotions.  It’s also nice to share feelings with friends and family, encouraging understanding and support. Highly recommend if you would like to be more present and compassionate with yourself and others."
5,Ninaccherie,I never write reviews. But this! This app deserves all the love in the world. It has been the biggest game changer in my self care/mental health journey. I’ve tried every mood/emotion tracking app there is. And nothing compares. The ability to check in and select a mood as many times per day as I want? Amazing. I always hated having to narrow my day down to one or two selections within other apps. This has helped me so much to keep track of my patterns throughout the entire day
5,jemzer,"I found this app last week after looking at the feelings wheel my therapist sent and wishing there was a better format to identify my feelings, and track them over time. It’s been a long time since i used an app that was actually delightful to engage with. I really love that i can add more than one emotion at a time, and that there are short definitions for each emotion which have been helping me build out my own emotional vocabulary. Best of all, the app is free!"
5,M.F.Wolf,This is a well-built app that excellently integrates psychology with technology. The video tools provided have already come in helpful. The ability to choose from a list of emotions is also incredibly eye-opening. I might think I’m feeling pleasant high energy but when I look at the list of words I sometimes find something that better describes how I’m currently feeling in another category.  I’ve already recommended this to co-workers and family.
5,cosmic_funshine,"It’s always been hard for me to express my feelings. I have always tried in different ways, but I’ve never truly able to explain to people how I feel especially to my wife or other family members. Since I got this app, it has been amazing helping me figure out how I feel and how to express how I feel and learning about my emotions I will suggest this app to anybody who just needs a chance to find out how to express themselves in a good way."
5,Nicole A.T.,"I have been trying to find an accurate and helpful step-by-step process to walk people through difficult emotions around their food and fitness goals. I’ve used bits and pieces of resources that are in this app, but I couldn’t quite put it all together. But this app does it and it does it BEAUTIFULLY. It’s the exact process people need, and I am so grateful to Dr. Brackett and his team for the work they’ve done and for creating this amazing, amazing tool for us 💛"
5,chandler_rogers,"I’m a startup founder and product designer, and let me just say — How We Feel is an absolute masterclass in design. The more I explore and use it, the more I’m blown away by the sheer beauty of this product. It’s incredibly thoughtful and delightful at every corner. From the animations to the artwork to the user experience — the interface breathes peace and self discovery. Kudos to the team for the outstanding work. Truly a far leap in quality beyond other things out there."
5,WordNerd1206,"My caregiver recommended this app to me.  I have been using it for 2 days, and have recommended it to my therapist, who is very excited about it.    The app is very user friendly, and uses different colors for each type of emotion.  I love that it gives definitions for what each specific emotion means, so it is easy to select the emotion that best suits our needs at the moment.  There are short videos that provide tips for feeling good, checking in with your body, and more.  The only change I wish to see here is the option to select multiple emotions, as I am often feeling multiple things at once.  For example, I might be feeling bored and restless at the same time.  I would like to be able to select both.  Overall, a great app, and thank you for providing it 100% free with no ads!"
5,jdirien,I work as a nervous system coach and this app has been so helpful for friends/family and clients to observe patterns. I’ve introduced it to 30+ people so far and we’re all obsessed.   We’d love to see an update in the future where we can add feelings that aren’t currently available as there have been times where certain feelings aren’t available or can’t be created by using two. Will continue to support the app by sharing and donating as best as I can.
4,AnnaRamona,"This app has been incredible to help me and my kiddos learn more about our feelings and share and express them. Thank you!! It would be really great to see three simple additions to make to create an even more complete experience and learning community around feelings: (1) the ability to enter more than one feeling at once, (2) the definitions of feelings to be shown to friends with the option to share the written/voice note, and (3) the option to “nudge” at any time"
3,spiritually_freed,"Needs more emotions. Heck, even if I need to write and catagorize my own, I'd like the option to add them. I like the app and it is user-friendly, although adding a secondary emotion is a bit tucked away into the app. However, without more emotion options, I will likely be deleting it within the next few months, as it is limiting to how I describe my emotions, rather than expanding my vocabulary regarding them. (Sorry to sound like a punk.) Otherwise, thanks for all the work you've put into it! The design of it is beautiful and the data analysis options are interesting and helpful."
5,Carlton A,"Just learned about this app a few weeks ago.  It is one of, if not the best apps I’m using. Tracking my emotions, and learning to understanding them, over time has given me a new, more hopeful outlook. Chronic pain sometimes gets me down and causes me to dwell on it.  But this app has allowed me to see that those instances are in the minority. Most of the time I’m upbeat and happy.  This has helped me decrease dwelling on pain which in turn has reduced the unpleasant sensations."
3,Yopumpkinhead,"I like the idea behind this app and much of the implementation - but it's missing key accessibility features in the lesson videos that render it frustrating at best to use. There are no closed captions/subtitles, nor any way to get the video content without listening to the audio. Plus, the video player's controls are unresponsive, nonstandard, and unlabeled - after extensive experimentation, I still don't know what one button is supposed to do. If these and other accessibility issues (like colorblind settings) were fixed I'd happily give five stars."
5,hfoll,"DOWNLOAD ASAP! I love this app!! I was trying to figure out how to help my clients understand emotions and their significance. I downloaded all the mental health apps possible and went through each one in hopes of finding something simple, helpful, and aesthetically pleasing. The ability to share with friends is the best is the best feature - you can check in without a conversation or use it to start one. We use technology so much, so it’s a more realistic approach."
5,peasblossoms,I really really really want to thank the developers for this awesome app. I have had it for about a month and it’s so user friendly and simple and HELPFUL that I actually use it. And it has made such a huge difference in my life. I especially love the short 1 min videos that gives you strategies to meet your emotions. Super short and helpful and the people presenting the information is so soothing! Thank you everyone who is involved in the app production for your care. :)
5,Mr. Beast for Presdient,"I typically don’t use apps that are for tracking or for my mood cause you have to pay for them and I forget I have them in the first place, however this one is incredible you can tell it is built off of a psychological view on how people feel and why and what may help, it coaches and tracks the fact that it is free is incredible to me and I love the idea of this being used in my life opposed to ignoring or pushing down my emotions…"
5,AnneliseAtlas,"This is the first app I’ve been delighted by enough to write a review about. The design and interactions are so pleasing and intuitive, the content is super professional and high quality, and it’s a genuinely useful tool for anyone who wants to be more in tune with your feelings and sharpen your personal emotional intelligence and self-compassion. My partner and I are using it as a way to check in with each other too! Great work to the team behind this app! ✨✨✨"
4,B Shorty,"I’ve been using this for a few days, and I think it could greatly improve with just one feature: The ability to react to your friends emotions. Liking, loving, cheering, etc could be helpful, like knowing that someone is there and cares about them. Or commenting, or maybe even a DM system. Not that it needs to be a social media app. I believe this feature would be a great way to boost social helpfulness and mental health effectiveness of the app. These could also be made optional. Thanks!"
5,ntothedtothek,"This app is amazing. I’ve shared it with my friends and family and they also love it. I’ve been wanting to journal for years, but have just never started. This app makes it so easy to sit down everyday and just write a few things down. Also, it’s nice that you can lock it, because that’s also been a concern about journaling is that someone will be able to read it. Great stuff all the way around!!"
5,Shmels,"I’ve really enjoyed using this app to reflect on my feelings and have appreciated the reminders to be more mindful of how I’m operating throughout the day. The information shared is also really easy to understand, helpful  and quick advice, and the visual effects are also pretty cool.   The one thing I would love to see is the ability to track more than two emotions each check in.   Thanks for sharing this great resource!"
5,Hazel N. Hopkins,"I actually never write reviews on apps, this is the first one i’ve writing in 4 years. But i genuinely love this app so much. it’s helped fights with me and my friends, it’s helped people understand me more, etc. There is so much stuff you can do on this app and it’s the first mental health app that’s helped me in a long while. Whoever made this HUGE thanks to you, you are a literal genius, i told all of my friends and family about this and they’re getting it soon."
5,Josh813,And this is the first to really stick. It’s simple which is necessary with this sort of thing. Something too bloated and you forget why you’re using the application. This isn’t bloated. It tracks single emotional data points. Easily decided by the user in a very pleasant front end design. You “want” to use the app. Which is good for something that the more you put into it the more you get.   Great work from this Team.
5,iamthenameless1,I have been looking for a better way to track mood changes and what impacts the way I feel. This is the perfect solution. Plus being able to share mood with my wife has helped us both get a better understanding of each other throughout the day. Also did I mention short little educational videos that give you insight into mood and ways to help yourself throughout your struggles. Absolutely love this app!
5,AMcConnell5,"I had a counselor recommend this to me and it’s truly amazing, all the features this offers and the videos to help you through actual emotions that you are currently feeling it’s like talking to a counselor/ therapist without the huge bill that goes with it. I enjoy “checking in” my feelings when I never thought something like this would help! I recommend this. No adds. Not asking for money all the time or at all."
5,gum_iie,"A great way to log emotions on the go and I treat it like a pseudo journal. It’s been really useful in helping me identify emotions and triggers since it categorizes feelings based off of tags you assign to them (people, places, etc) The interface is simple and friendly and gives you exactly what you need!  The only thing I wish there was was a way to back up data/cross save… my old phone broke and I completely lost all the entries on it :("
5,Eileen Sideways,"I accidentally happened upon this app, and I’m so glad I found it. Love the clean interface and option to add photos. The photo feature helps me feel lighter when stress picks up and intense emotions surface. I take pics that complement my notes. Looking forward to seeing more strategy tools and videos specific to certain emotion groups when funds allow over time. Thank you to all involved in developing this app!"
5,CJFranc,I love everything about this app. I love the look and how easy it is to navigate. The definitions of each emotion help me so much to identify what I’m really feeling. And the tools they give you after your check in that coincide with the emotion is so helpful for me. I want to write the longest review ever for this app. To tell people how amazing it is. These tools work. I never write reviews for apps either but this is truly fantastic. I can’t thank the creators enough.
4,Boolean 99,"I really love this app! It helps find, describe, and source one’s emotions and logs them in a very convenient way that’s easy to read and review. But there is only one thing that I would add to make it better: subtitles/transcripts to the videos. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t have a lot of alone time where I can watch and listen to the videos, which I really want to do. If I had another way to consume the information, then this would be one of my all time favorite apps!"
5,egushchin,"Seriously, that’s the first app when I went to an appstore itself, searched the app and decided to leave 5 star review with no prompting.  The app design is brilliant! Functional 4-color scheme is reflected in tab bar icons, labels on emotions, even scrims over images are tinted with color. Gradients create soft an vibrant  tone for interface.   Build quality, responsiveness, UX: check-ins&guided journey, cinematographic videos style, shape of emotions, using serif fonts along with sans serifs, the use of color accents, ampersands…the list goes on, — everything is top notch.  It makes every check-in a little celebration and i can’t wait for the next one. Statistics and graphs are super informative and well presented.   The app is non-profit and doesn’t collect any user data. Highly recommended!"
5,ato yonas,"I won’t name them here, but I have tried several mood tracking apps. None of them come even close to this one. The user experience is so intuitive and is a genuine pleasure, so much so that I really look forward to logging my next mood. The lessons are really helpful and very meditative. I can’t wait to see a deep analysis of my moods over time and to learn more about myself through this app. Thank you so much! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾"
5,samantha342,"i never ever write reviews for apps. but this one has seriously made a huge impact. i have bpd, adhd, anxiety and depression, you name it i have it with emotion irregularity. my therapist has been wanting me to keep track of my feelings/mood so we can try to figure out the best way to tackle that problem. sounds super easy until i get my notebook out and every time i go to track my mood all i can think of is “meh”  i just got this this week so im going to tell her about it next session, i think she’ll be really really excited about it. im even going to mention that i can share it with her and maybe she’d think that was a good idea but if not at least i have an easy, accessible and accurate app that i can track all of this. im really happy about it"
5,8LYN8,"I’ve been using this app for a few months. It’s so simple and to the point, you don’t get bombarded with ads and popups asking to pay for some kind of premium version (which only result in more irritation for me). Checking in emotions is quick, although I do wish there was a widget for even quicker check ins, im still satisfied. The monthly breakdowns are so nice to see, and glad it’s all for free too. Super helpful, thanks devs/creator :)))"
5,*MJL*,"I’ve got a lot, I mean A LOT of apps to help me with mental health but I haven’t stuck with any except for this one. It is so simple, yet effective and helpful. I have a 127 day streak on this app and I have had this app for over a year now, and I am so happy about that. I love to go back to my older check ins and remember things I’ve felt in the past. If you want a good app to help keep control over your emotions, positive or negative, download “How We Feel”!!!"
5,diane3909,"I am an empathetic person and I have worked with my feelings for a long time, but I have never quite had the language to describe them. This app teaches the subtle differences between feelings, not sad but forlorn, not good but tranquil, to give a couple of examples. Then it gives me a history of what I felt. This will help me express myself, and identify the feelings of others. Along with short videos of how to help and be helped. And all backed by science."
5,SunsetsandSunflowers,"I suffer from bipolar disorder and with it, I have the inability to communicate my emotions. With this app, I can freely share how I feel and it makes me feel understood and safe. Getting to do daily check ins and learn from the lessons and videos gives me clarity. It’s something I use when I can’t see my therapist. It’s like a journal but better. Definitely recommend this app for everyone needing that little support"
5,CL-Bot,"I have been using this for a few days now and its really great! It does what it sets out to do and is a simple way to see what emotions you are feeling at a given time. However, one crucial feature I have not seen is locking. I saw under settings is a setting for verification, but i did not see a way to turn it on. I think this is very much needed for this app, as emotions are so personal. Thanks again for making this!"
5,Twotwo22tuheew,I have been using this since I heard about it on Tiktok a few days ago. I never actually keep up with tracking apps but this one has me wanting to do extra check ins. It’s really helpful naming my feelings because it allows me to see the variation in my experience. I am so excited to see how much more helpful this app will be once I’ve done it for a while and have some real data to work with!
5,Whats your fav,This app is terrific and meaningful to the user.  Highly effective videos that are right to the point and helpful every time. I check in 3 times a day. I thought I lived in the red and I don’t - which I’m happy about and the green and yellow shades on the check in circle are improving my emotions. I’m an educator and I’m telling my students about this and they are also using the app. This app should be used in schools every day curriculum. Let’s get something started!
5,Monica 774949,"I love many of the features, and I’m still exploring them. I’ve been using it consistently form only  about two weeks and I love it. It’s now part of my daily routine. It’s extremely liberating to have a tool/resource to help you track and better understand your emotional self.   The UI is very intentional and incorporates emotional design forward thinking. It FEELS good to use. It’s pleasant to use. Thank you for creating this ✨"
5,makingpolyamorywork,"This is a really good app and I highly recommend it. I recommend it to my clients and people in my coaching programs. I think it’s really helpful to check in and keep a record of how you’re feeling especially during hard times because sometimes we can forget what triggered our moods, or how overall were feeling. This app just keeps getting better and better!"
5,sophiaxox_21,My therapist recommended me to this app and I have to say it is the best mental health app I have come across and everything being free with no charges or adds is so appreciated! It is an amazing space to journal share my emotions and reflect on the past weeks and analyze my moods as well as my favorite being all the quotes I have come across which are all so inspiring and helpful. Love love love this app and highly recommend it its truly one of a kind
3,OakilyDokily,"It works well as a log spot, but I don’t think it functions well as a history, you have to scroll through all the past stuff and can’t see it as an overall whole. I’d like to track how I feel as a total but currently I have to write them all down and tally them up. I wish it had a function that allowed me to see a chart that shows which emotions I choose the most, which quadrant I choose from most, that type of thing. I like it so far and I hope they continue with it and add features for better review."
5,--DarkNight--,"This has helped my just sit and think about my emotions and sorta journal them. Doesn’t sound like it would do much but it really helps you process things and get on with your day.  My one suggestion is to maybe implement an optional security lock? Like every time you open the app you have to sign in with Face ID or Touch ID? Because I wouldn’t want anyone else to be able to open this and see it, because it’s private?"
5,mymy_jellyfish,"I love this! Simple, user friendly, and the shapes and colors are so satisfying for my brain Suggestions: Add a way to add custom emotions? There are some that I use that aren’t in the app and I think it’s likely impossible to have enough for each person built in to the app, so a way to add custom ones + categorize them to a preexisistent color/category would be helpful Also, a graph timeline in the analyze section would be nice!"
5,hongcaitlin,"First of all, love the app! Today the app was deleted from my phone and I unfortunately lost all of the data that had been on it. Is there any way to restore it? I had only been using the app for the last three days but had been pretty eager to start seeing trends soon. I tried emailing support but I got an automated message saying the email address could not be found. Other than that, love the concept behind this."
4,heathermarshmello,"love this app. I do wish there were a few small updates to the app. sometimes I feel an emotion that is not available to pick, so I wish there was a way to write in the emotion. similarly, often I feel “hungry” or “uncomfortable” or “overstimulated” and those are not options. I know they aren’t exactly emotions and are more body-feelings, but I think they can be insightful words to describe my feelings and I wish I could pick them on the app."
5,Jess1e_Sarda,"I do not normally take the time to write a review on apps just because it takes time and there’s so many options. However, this app definitely deserves my time in sharing how helpful it is. When I don’t have the confidence to take in what I’m reading I can switch over to a video where someone tells it to me.  I also love all the options it gives me and explanation of how I feel. Best app truly."
3,Jostero,"Only issues so far after a few days of using the app: are I wish there was a way to add multiple feelings at once, instead I’m having to go back and check in twice to add more complex, mixed feelings I’ve had. Also hope for a feature to be added that allows to click where in the body I’m feeling the emotion and believe it would be helpful to further understand feelings by adding a somatic aspect. Other than that love the short lessons and ability to add personal input on feelings"
3,Kitty Cotton Candy,"This is an amazing app and I’m so grateful that it’s available for free. I can tell a lot of care went into it from the team. It integrates a lot of features that can help identify patterns in mood and has a mental health positive tone.  To Developers: One bug I’ve found is that when you go to your Daily Steps review page, the infographic flickers out and goes black. Additionally, the exercise stats don’t sync from the Health app. Lastly, there’s no way to contact developers, so it’s disappointing that we need to communicate through a review."
4,kgclean,This is an absolute fantastic application. It has helped me so much and describing how I’m feeling to others. One thing that would make it absolutely perfect in my eyes would be the ability input using my Apple Watch. A lot of times I don’t have the ability to check my phone for long periods of time and these are often the times when I am most busy and I just feel like I’m missing the ability capture that.
5,meme yes master,"I tried this app today because I was in a generally sad mood from news I got. I knew this app was going to be good from the first thing I did. The breathing exercises helped so much and thinking of things from the other persons point of view made me think. It made me think of other peoples thoughts and feelings, it made me think I should be better towards people. So for that I say thank you for making this app."
5,LVPendergrass,"The world would be a much better place if everyone had this app. It’s so extremely helpful for me. It’s so simple and easy to use, but at the same time it provides so much helpful information and advise. I also LOVE that it is completely free, with no ads, and they don’t ask for ANY personal information! I feel safe knowing they won’t sell my data because they don’t have any. It’s my favorite app ever."
5,jenna_jaeid,"I’ve been searching for ways to emotionally educate myself so I can self regulate better. Also, a journal I can come to whenever I need to process tough emotions or record my celebrations that I have with me at all times. Also, something that would teach me vocabulary for what I feel. This app does all AND MORE. Tools for emotional understanding and regulation. Charts and graphs so you can learn trends. Ah! I love this app! I’m sharing with all my loved ones."
5,Fancy Piggie,This app has helped me a lot through some recent trauma. Being able to associate words with feelings and have an outlet to just ramble all of my true feelings has helped a lot. Plus being able to see all sorts of statistics have shown me when my worst hours are. I still have a long way to go but I feel less alone having this app. Thank you to all the developers.
5,RxQueen19,"I never thought I could or would rely on an app to help me with my emotions and mental struggles, but this app is so different. I’m awful at keeping up to date with most “check in” apps, but since the time I downloaded this, I haven’t missed a single step.    The videos and insights given in video and reading format are mind altering and amazing. I’m truly grateful to have stumbled upon this app, and I’m even more grateful for the people behind it.   I’d pay a lot of money for this app. Just saying. (I’ve downloaded and tried a TON of paid apps/subscriptions…all of which were immediately removed, unsubscribed, or ignored.)  To me, this is one of the most useful tools on my entire phone. I surely hope it helps others as much as it does me!!"
5,pferrerferrer_,"This is a real review from a real person, gotta say that since these pages are usually full of bots. The app has great design, is very intuitive and simple to use, and it truly helps put emotions into words and understand them better. It’s almost like a micro journaling app that helps you understand how you feel throughout the day as many times as the user wants. Definitely recommend!!"
5,Lejewels,"I was thinking of building an app like this until I stumbled across this one. It’s beautifully designed, thoughtfully mixes the main use case of learning about and tracking emotions with short reviews and high level analytics, with educational material. It’s helped me through a number of rough emotional days, express myself better, and see the bigger picture. Big thank you to this team!"
5,Feel to Heel,Thank you Thfor creating at our fingertips the resource to name & recognize emotions. Its helpful the informative interactive & mindful videos support stopping & being present instead of pushing away. I love increasing word vocabulary with emotions that are more typically categorized into few options. This is so fantastic! Ive even got my husband doing it who is very resistance to any emotion recognition. Bravo! Ive recommended it to so many already!
5,warrior cat lova,"when i first began using this, i was a mess. i had no idea how to identify my emotions or how i was feeling at all. but now, i’ve learned strategies and new words to express how i’m feeling. i know that emotions don’t last forever, and we need to tell ourselves that. i’m finally in control. you could say i’ve taken the wheel. from the very bottom of my heart thank you, How We Feel. you’ve changed my life."
5,Hoybeck,I don’t know how this app could be more perfect! As a life coach the first thing I teach clients is how to understand and process their emotions and this app is the PERFECT tool to recommend to my clients. During a session they are able to open the app and get more clear on what emotion they are feeling and put a name to it. The quick lessons are wonderful. I’ve personally learned a lot from this app already!! I have been recommending it to everyone.
5,hdnsbxbdhwjjans,"I’ve been using this app for a few weeks now, and I’m already noticing that I feel more compassionate towards myself and my emotions. I’ve tried several mental health apps, and so far this is the only one that’s made a notable positive impact. The lack of ads and asking for you to sign up for a subscription is awesome as well!  I love this app, and I can see myself using it for a long time."
4,Tallen37,"The app is great! I believe it’s amazing that you have created an app that focuses on understanding and processing feelings healthily.   Pros:  great videos, short sweet and to the point.  Love the reframing, mindfulness strategies/techniques to add to my arsenal  Love the feelings check in display because it includes the definitions of these feelings. I was calling out so many of the wrong feelings and didn’t know it.   LOVE THAT THE DATA IS MINE AND ONLY MINE!!!!!!! No explanation needed here    Areas of improvement:  The feeling wheel may be ‘elementary’ but the high/low energy selections within the checkin doesn’t resonate with me. Maybe something new to get used to but I like seeing how the ‘core’ feelings like bad can also be connected to feeling apathetic or overwhelmed.   Wish you can add multiple emotions to the check-in."
5,anon813318,"I've had apple products since 2009, and this may be the 2nd ever app review I've ever written. I use this app to keep in touch with my siblings who are over 2,000 miles away and it helps me feel connected to them in a way I've Been looking for for almost 5 years since I've moved away. Worth it even if you are just checking in with yourself. And it gets easier over time :)"
5,htudejgd,I’ve downloaded and tried several journaling apps with hopes of watching for mood trends. This app is the best app BY FAR. So easy to use and track. Beautiful design. I love how you can assign an emotion to your day/entry and it also gives a short explanation on what the emotion your selecting means. I will continue to use this app as I work on healing. 🙏🏼🕊️ Thank you for taking the time to make this so well functioning.
5,ninjin,"I highly recommend this free app. I use it as a mood tracker and love their ‘analyze’ section for finding patterns. Lovely, simple design; great UX; highly customizable options. The super-short, science-based tutorial videos are excellent, as are the suggested exercises for coping with certain emotions.   If you (or someone you love) has trouble identifying their emotions, this app’s array and list (with definitions) can be so helpful in building emotional literacy.   If you want to, you can even share the basics of your entries with friends you’ve linked in the app (you can decide with each share who can see it).  So impressive! I can’t believe this is free. Better than the expensive mood tracker apps! I was happy to donate to keep this project funded."
5,i larb you 3000,"i’ve used other mood trackers in the past, but this app is by far the most effective! i love how i can quickly search for how i’m feeling and keep going without having to journal every detail of my day. and after a week or so, i can check on myself and see what i might need to change. my one request would be to add a section of emotions that aren’t pleasant or unpleasant. oftentimes i feel “whatever” or neutral or uninspired, and i thought that perhaps these emotions (along with others) could possibly be added to a little grey area in between the four current colors. some other examples for this could include numb or empty. thanks so much for creating this app! love it!"
5,Erica Camacho,"Absolutely love this app, it’s done fantastic with motivating me to check in. However, my one issue is that you cannot log more than one emotion at a time which is frustrating for me because i like to keep track of my whole self and not one aspect, so adding a primary, bigger emotion and a secondary, lesser emotion that may still be present could be useful for some of us!"
5,xlexie7,"I want to show my support for this app, especially because they have made a commitment to remaining free for all to access and not requiring a subscription. I donated as well (college student so not much) but this app is going to help support my therapy appointments and I just feel like I needed to express my gratitude. All I can hope for now is that I remain consistent, thank you to the How We Feel team."
4,teaash,"I think this app is awesome! The colors and transitions between sections & words is simple yet engaging.  The only thing I wish it had is the ability to add your own words or new words. There’s a great choice of words given already, but I think it would be more personal if you could add your own words :)  I’d recommend this app to anyone & everyone because it’s super easy to use and takes less than a minute to log your emotion."
5,bellebat,"This app is amazing.👍The app,  How We Feel tracks how much sleep, exercise, and what your feeling everyday!  This app is great for people who have a lot of anxiety most of the day and need some tips to calm down and breathe…. This app is wonderful for anyone who wants to know how they feel normally everyday!🌸 So, if your that person, then download this app today. Its definitely Worth it!!!🌈☮️✨  Thanks!🌈✌️🍀"
5,AncientArch,I’m really enjoying the app. The unique interactions of selecting an emotion are really slick and make using the app a pleasure.   One request - any plans to add additional options to sign up for an account? Apple’s SSO makes it impossible to separate the Apple ID from the account later on it desired. The ability to create a new account with email and password would be greatly appreciated
5,cmajeski71,"I don’t review many apps but this one has been so amazing & helpful to my personal horny of understanding the self. It’s completely free & packed with tips that are actually helpful. I love that it’s also totally free with no payment model, it’s something that I know many people may not appreciate or value but full self discovery should be accessible to everyone. I’m so grateful this app helps bridge that gap. Thank you developers so much."
5,Unhappy secu member,"This is the most wonderful app ever! I have never written a review for an app before, but I had to write one for this app. I absolutely love how well designed it is both promised standpoint, app, design, and in terms of being a thoughtful mental health tool. I cannot believe that this app is free and it really makes me happy that the exists and is accessible to everyone! Thank you so much to all the creators of this app."
5,nobariya,I love this app! I got a few of my friends on it and it’s nice to be able to see their feelings as well. This might not be the whole point of the app but I would love to be able to have the option to share the note or picture that I placed with the feeling! I think it could just be a small thing to add but obviously this is a more individual focused app!
5,Breezi95,My therapist suggested this app to me about a lil over a week ago. I like that it has so many options to choose my emotions. Sometimes I don't know the word just the feeling so this helps to better name my emotions. And I like that it's like my own personal journal. I even added my therapist so I can share my check-ins with her. I wish I knew about this app sooner. And I hope it stays free
4,madelinedawnr,Love this app have been using it for the past week it’s so awesome to take a minute and think about how you are actually feeling and to reflect on the things around you. I love seeing how my friends are feeling and learning things about their life I wouldn’t normally know!  I really wish you could comment on each others  feelings though! That would be awesome!  Again love the app! It’s wonderful!
2,13rats,"I thoroughly enjoyed this app before the latest updates. Dividing check-ins into multiple menu pages has made checking in more time consuming and less convenient to do throughout my day. I’m also very confused by the choice to turn some data entries into clunky sliding bars? It’s a terribly inaccessible feature - my fine motor skills are okay and even I find them impossible to use.   Still a great idea for an app and one that I miss, unfortunately I now find it too inconvenient to bother with."
5,Top 10 No Code Podcast,"Who said that simple apps cant be hugely beneficial, and also who said that simple apps cant be beautifully designed?  Yes, How We Feel is a simple app, check in twice a day about your feelings… but the lesson that teaches you about consistently checking in with your feelings is invaluable. And it does through beautiful and smooth user experience."
5,NCE test taker,"This app is fantastic, helping to build emotional vocabulary. As a mental health professional, working in elementary school, I would love to use this with my students. I would love the option to give each client a different profile, to ensure daily checking. I believe that the  data gained would be insightful and allow us to purposely plan preventative care. Thank you for this amazing app!"
5,ggarol,"Immediately love this app even though I only got it a few days ago. So easy to set up and get started using right away. I love the notifications throughout the day and how quickly I can update my emotions without taking time out of my day. For future updates, it would be great if there was a way to input medications taken and when/how they affect your emotions throughout the day."
5,gghjiuuutttrrress,"With the recent change to the UI, writing lengthy notes has become a bit clunky. When my writing eventually reaches the “Save” button at the bottom, there’s no gap between my writing and the button, and it feels kinda cramped . Could you guys add some space between the text input region and the white save button? Thanks"
5,Perlexo,"I dont even know where to start. And its 3:27 am right now so im not gonna type a lot. but to summarize, for everything being FREE. Its so worth it. This app has been SUPER helpful and every (i forgot the word for it) function is like amazing. Theres so many words to describe your emotion. And it actually educates you on what it means. Like i love it. And theres a lot more!! just download it!!"
5,Volcanic Ash Vocanic Mustash,This application is amazing. I used to scream just to say I am enraged but now I can just say something on the app. It’s not like other review app where tou have to pay just to say I am terrified. This application is tranquil an calm and I love it. But I think there is a microscopic bug. Fragile is in the low energy pleasant feeling section.
5,podsolncechnuesemechki,"It’s a refresher to see an app that doesn’t ask for account sign up and stored data on device. Also not asking for money everywhere for new version. Seems like devs actually tried to focus on app that will help with users unlike a lot of other mental health support apps out there.   I think it’s a bit cluttered as far as UI structure and not naturally simple.  Also because some of the important functionality is missing. Like why can’t I add my own type of how I’m feeling vs only using predefined, etc, if it exists maybe it’s not obvious and UI can be improved for better UX  Overall pretty stoked, been meaning to build something like that myself for a while!"
5,djlynxh,"I’ve heard a lot of good things about this app but I never thought it would work for me since I’ve never really been the type to express my emotions or know what I’m feeling in that moment in time, but ever since I got this I feel I’ve gained a lot of self awareness and overall positivity just saying what’s on my mind in the app and I couldn’t ask for anything better."
4,Hungergamesfangirl,"I get three notifications at the same times every day, but they’re too predictable. I’d get more use out of it if there was an option for a specific number of random check in reminders, maybe with a range that could be set (say from 8am-midnight). I think I’d be more honest with my feelings if I wasn’t anticipating being reminded to address my feelings."
5,asiagabs,"I use How We Feel to manage anxiety/PMDD, ADHD, and cptsd symptoms. It’s beautifully simple and complex in nature and has ENDLESS uses to get to know my emotions better. It’s the key to emotional regulation!  With AI update, it’s a game changer. I’m in the IT space and find the Reflect tool to be a fantastic way to dive into and take action from. It’s really supportive and kind which is helpful for me."
4,Tiana Hesper,"This app is really helpful for recording my emotions conveniently—great job!   However, I’d like to ask if there’s a way to export my data into a format like CSV that I can process and visualize myself. That would make it perfect. Currently, the export feature seems to only provide a PDF, which isn’t very useful for further analysis.   Thank you and looking forward to this improvement!"
5,Duiease,I love all the updates in the app. I appreciate the opportunity to select multiple emotions because I think limiting to one emotion was a bit challenging before because I would feel multiple things. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to understand their emotions more things happen throughout life.
5,Gab.riel.,"This is my absolute favorite app. There’s nothing better than this to journal and figure my emotions out. Thank you.   There can also be other vocabulary words like feeling like a “Burden” or words for procrastination, but other than that, there’s a good wide variety and I love it.  The fact that there’s something showing unique emotions is very calming to me, it makes me feel human."
5,t.rose13,"This app is my far the most underrated mental health app. It’s not only completely free, it also doesn’t require any subscriptions or extra fees. I’ve struggled with dealing with intense emotions and even identifying names of these emotions. They videos and lessons are so helpful. And it also has assistance support for those who are visually impaired or have other disabilities."
5,DZD4K,"Loving the design and features, the education that sometimes comes up is very right on in its content and the production value is high - bravo!     It’s really wonderful to not be upsold while doing this work. It is a rare and beautiful gift you are giving which is inspiring and gives one hope in this world. Thank you so very much."
2,alli9203,"I was just using this app and thinking about how amazing it was and what a miracle it's all free when I decided to check out the tools feature. I was intrigued by the new sounds tool option and clicked on that. My phone shut down from glitching so hard, and now whenever I open the app it just glitches and kicks me out. So much for enjoying this app I guess. Quite sad because I really did feel like this app was so great and helpful and now it doesn't work :,("
5,Virgot!1,"I love the style and the little animations the app has. I love how after u track your emotion for the day, u get a certain videos giving you suggestions & tips on ways to overcome the emotion you have especially, if you track mostly low emotions. It’s very sleek and to the point, and I love how I can look back on which emotion I have tracked the most. To gather how I am as a person."
4,saghaulor,"I’ve been using the app for about a week and so far I really appreciate it. However, there’s no option for iCloud backup which presumably means I can’t change devices or sync across devices, which is kind of a bummer since I started using on my iPad but I would mostly use on my phone.   A way to sync across devices and backup/restore my checkins would be greatly appreciated."
5,Adritherapist,Honestly sometimes between all my studies and the patients I see I loose track of my own emotions and necessities. This is a great way to analyze yourself self and in some ways incorporate psychology and/or detect when you actually need to of benefit from seeing a therapist being more clear headed towards your situation and the patterns that follow. Love the techniques and how personalized it feels. Absolutely recommend it!
1,"A, S, Mr.","I like the idea of having a healthy relationship to our emotions and I’m often prone to downloading self help apps. This app, though elegantly designed made me pause. There are bizarre, cold videos of “experts?” telling you to deal with your “emotion” in the same way that an asocial doctor would examine bacteria on a Petri dish. Why are we as humans, as the messy, emotional, bewildering creatures that we are, trying to make ourselves into machines. Things that can be plugged into diagnostics software and reprogrammed for optimality? Self awareness is a great thing, but is that what technology is giving us? Or is it giving us self restriction? Self judgement? Self-denial?"
5,lady_llama,My therapist recommended this as a way to track my moods and make myself more aware of my feelings and the triggers for the not so fun ones. Been using it faithfully for almost a month now and it’s been a big help. This is a well thought out and easy to use method of mood tracking than I’ve seen in a while.
5,readingdude756,The whole app is very clean and straightforward. I enjoy how simple they show the emotions as colors and bite size information about what this emotion generally means. The apps flexibility with how much or little you want to make it a journal with emotions is very nice as well. There are minor things that I would like to see but dont effect the use ability of the app
5,guest9335618,"I am a pediatric psychiatric provider. After trying the app myself, I was blown away by the data and trends I could identify. I have since started recommending the app to all of my patients and many friends and colleagues. Marvelous for identifying patterns and trends in mood fluctuations and also offers tools and education to further empower you on your journey!"
5,marceliinee,"im autistic and it makes describing emotions accurately is really hard for me without figuring it out. I love all the descriptions here and how transparent they are, especially being able to log and see the statistics them.  I have noticed more emotions were added, but they are only visible from the search bar and not the initial screen."
5,iam_violet,"I love this. It’s one of the few apps out there that truly has no ads or in-app purchases, it’s well-designed, and just the kind of mood tracker/journal I’ve been looking for. I will say a fully iPad compatible app would be great, and also the ability to back up/sync between devices using your Apple account. Honestly it’s amazing as-is though."
5,kstorjohann3,"I’m a psychology student looking into becoming an emotions researcher and I truly love this app. It’s exactly what I’ve been looking for in a diary, I’m obsessed with the emotional regulation techniques, and then 10-part Emotions 101 videos were so helpful! I just hope this app reaches the audience it deserves and I hope to continue the work of providing emotional literacy to the public just as this app does so well."
5,omg take my nickname,"The app is beautifully made and its premise is wonderful. I love that it’s free and helping its users understand their emotions—initiatives like this truly do their little part to make the world better.  The design and UI is intuitive and very attractive. The flow of the app is smooth and picking out your emotion from the emotion compass is a visual treat.   Overall a very, very well made and thoughtful app."
3,Mooooooons,"I tracked the weather for a month and my data never appeared, probably because when I clicked entered it said ‘update steps’ rather than weather. It looks like there was an update that shows the weather, but the range is very odd and doesn’t show my monthly data. It goes from -132 to 176 degrees, in 44 degree intervals which doesn’t make sense. I also wish it kept the entries answering ‘why I’m feeling this way’ were saved / visible"
5,franthemaneiei,"I have downloaded every mental health app that I could find, and have not been nearly as satisfied as I am with this one. I’m currently in the depths of my depression, and I’m using every avenue to getting help that is available to me. I’m so blessed to have found this one, and especially that it’s free and remains free by others’ donations. Thank you so much to the creators and editors, and to the donators."
5,JJHill10,I have been using this app to keep myself vigilant and aware of my day-to-day experiences and emotions. It has been a huge help and has made me much more capable of monitoring myself and understanding my behaviors and emotions. I highly recommend using this app if you are interested in improving your mental health or simply understanding and interacting with your feelings on a regular basis!
4,lifeguardswimmer,"I love this app and have really benefited from it! My only complaint is that you all took away the “return”/shift button when adding a description onto a log. Sometimes I need the space in between certain thoughts and need to really separate them while still keeping them in the same log. It bothers me that everything is now crammed into one paragraph, it makes me anxious lol. Please bring it back."
5,mb62609,"Easy and quick to use so I can track my moods throughout the day. I use this to detect when I may be entering a PMDD or depressive episode. I’ve also found that by labeling my emotions I am getting better at expressly them. Journal feature is good to provide context for the feelings, and tags are helpful to see when/where certain emotions arise."
5,Homo😼,I have been using this app for a couple of weeks and it’s really good. There are a lot of good qualities about it. Such as you can actually put more than one feeling. It also actually tracks them and how you felt for that week and not just not tracking them like other apps. I would definitely recommend 🙂
5,clxxdy-days,I love this app so much. I get bored with apps like this really easily normally and feel so pressured to come back each day that I delete it. With this app I feel no pressure whatsoever and it helps me get my feelings out without having to talk to somebody about them. The lessons are extremely helpful too and help me cope with my emotions. This app is so great and I would recommend to everyone!
5,baaed6409,Only been using this for a week but I absolutely love the color scheme and especially especially the feature of having a clear definition of each emotion. I love that because it’s been making me really think about and ask myself if the particular emotion is really what I’m feeling. Somewhat nudging me to take a deeper analysis of what I’m experiencing.
5,yane1987dugan,I have had problems identifying feelings and emotions my whole life. This app has been like a rescue tool for me. I share my emotions with my daughter using the share feature. This app is free and has made a difference in the way I perceive my inner world since the day #1 I started using it. Thank you to whoever came up with the idea of this app. God bless you!
5,treehugger❤️🌴🌳🌸🌺,"This app is so relaxing, and the first time i tried it and saw how many emotions to pick from, I just knew this app would be a fav! and it also only notifies you on checking in! i know this is a short review, but that’s because i first got this app. All in all i would give this 4.8 stars if i could. (it’s great, but there’s always room for improvement!)"
4,xavier73129,"Overall, I enjoy this app a lot and it’s definitely been very helpful for me, but since the recent update, there’s now an extra step to type in commentary, which I thought was already covered in the previous layout.   Would be nice to either turn that off or maybe revert back to what it used to look like?"
4,Johojojojo1234567,"The “mood meter” that I often recommend and use with client as a psychotherapist has been rebranded!  I think it’s fascinating what our emotions look like as “data”, and what the practice on mindfulness and insight building can give to us.  I am happy to see they’ve added the ability to set prompts! However, a huge blindspot remains in ignoring the BODY.  Users: add to your journal section! What is your body saying? What are your eyes and breath doing? Your face? Is there stress? Pain? Strain? Activity? Lack of activity? What can you feel or not feel? Are you feeling hyperactive? Hypoactive? Are you holding your body in a certain posture? Your body might tell a story that your mind and emotions aren’t tuned into. Give it some consideration."
5,C1273,"A friend suggested I download this app so we could check in with one another and it’s been great! I find it extremely helpful in being specific with naming confusing emotions, seeing trends in how i’m feeling, and paying more attention to my needs. I love how many features there are for being a free app! I highly recommend downloading :)"
5,Purrrrrring,I see why this app is award-winning after using it a week!! It is so well thought out and incredibly easy to use. I recommend this app to everyone who wants to track their emotions. This app covers everything in one app. Try it for a week and you will see but it has to offer. It’s quite amazing what they’ve done. :)
2,FudgeIsGreatFudgeIsGood,"After updating the app every time I tried open it, it would crash. So I finally decided to delete it and redownload it. Once I redownloaded it I found that all of my data had been deleted. Which is really disappointing since I really liked this app and the interface. I feel like it was really helping me but at this point I’d rather just write down my emotions and actually have reliable backup data of my entries rather than using an app that will delete it all after updating."
3,OrionEridanus,The AI reflect tool does not always render well. The screen scrolls the bottom “finish” button to the top of the screen anx  just shows blank screen below and I can’t read the AI message. This happens sometimes and nearly always when select “go deeper.” I find the AI tool responses helpful for further self reflection and it is annoying that much of the time I can’t read them.   I am running iOS 18 on an iPhone 12
4,Last Update Problem,"I love this app. I use it every day, 4x/day. I’m able to track my mood against menstrual cycles, work stress, family conflict, etc. But there are days that I feel fairly neutral, and it does not fit into the four categories of emotions that are provided. I wish there was a fifth category that sits in between the rest where it reflects these days better. Examples would be “present”, “neutral”, “meditative”, etc."
5,IvyPie723,I downloaded this app with the goal of having more awareness of my emotions. I love that it helps me find words to describe what I’m feeling. The short videos are helpful and motivational. I love the idea of being able to step back with perspective and analyze my emotions. It helps to have that degree of separation. It’s a great reminder that we are not our emotions or our thoughts.
5,Frozencoastie,"I’m grateful for this app. My struggle has been to put a meaning name to my emotions allowing me to communicate how I feel with others, or just recognize and accepting a feeling. This is a simple and power app and as a bonus (not counting the matrices) is the videos walking me through a better understanding of myself. So yes, I love this app and definitely recommend for others."
5,1youngtolo,I am now an emotional scientist because of this app instead of rarely having good days I now have the ability to create good days and everyday is an adventure because I never know what emotion will pilot me into creating something incredible  Imagine an artist who learned how to control their emotions  I am so elated confident and proud because of this app
4,Leftie here,"I love this app it’s helped me stabilize. I have the following improvements though. It should ask to connect to step counting, exercise, sleeping and meditation apps. Tracking this information in multiple locations is annoying. The step counter in Apple health seems like an obvious improvement same with some major meditation apps.   Over all still love it!"
5,Acoustiks2006,"Capturing my moods and emotions throughout the day in a wonderfully organized way - multiple ways really - is a great feature.  The notes section has served as a good journal unexpectedly.  I write A LOT everyday.  The videos are free and full of great mental exercises or just good advice in general.  Been very good for my mental health - thank you for this free app, it should be nominated or recognized somehow.  Well done 👏🏻"
5,Lorree22,"Quick and customizable mood tracker. The 4 quadrants really help with the process and I like being able to track the trends very quickly by tapping on common or customizable answers (what are you doing, where are you, who are you with). It also offers insights and practices to process the emotions. And it’s free! Very thankful for this app."
4,Esh217,Good practice to get in the habit of tracking emotions but wish I could adjust times of log when I forget to do it exactly at the time I’m feeling the emotion. Also having issues where I click to log emotion and the screen is “black” so I can’t type background on why I’m feeling a certain kind of way. I have to close the app and go back in to adjust.
5,Hamprincesse,"Wow this is such a great tool to help understand our emotions, mood, and much more. Lot of good videos and resources to help along the way. I like that you can share how are you feeling with others. My family and I are using it and sharing. We love it. Thank you to the developers of this app for providing such an amazing tool. Not to mention it’s completely FREE"
5,SW1FT 67,"I have literally only been using this app for 5 days and I feel like it has changed my life. I never knew that the 17 year old guy that I am lacked so much emotional intelligence! I actually feel like I can describe my emotions to my girlfriend and it’s helped at lot. Props to this app, I recommend everyone start using it!"
5,mariesey1986,Thank you for the team who created this app. I struggle to articulate what I feel and I often find myself twisted in knots at the end of the day. I love all the little moodlets with definitions. The short videos and lessons are very helpful. This is a great tool to have if you struggle with anything especially regulating your emotions.
5,1ThinkingThoughts,"I started using this app and have been so impressed. I have tried many different “feelings” apps. At first look, this app seemed like the rest but it didn’t take much exploring to see that I is much more than a feelings log. The videos offered by professionals are like free, mini therapy sessions!! Such a great resource I have shared with others."
5,Mitchell_J_101,"Do you feel constant stress or anxiety? I did, and this app helps me understand better what that means and how to better manage those unpleasant feelings. It gives me a large word bank I can use to describe what exactly what I’m feeling, and has an amazing database of exercises and lessons on what to do when experiencing pain or joy. I’m so thankful for this free tool."
4,sunnyhae,"love this app!! helps me to be more in touch with my emotions and keep track of what it was like when i felt those emotions. one thing i hope the app can do later on is Sync data across devices! especially if i move to a new phone, id love to download the app, sign in, and still see my old entries from my previous phone and from other devices"
5,beepboopbuuubeep,"I have been using this app for a week and it’s helped me identify my emotions so I can better work through them. I’m in therapy for C-PTSD and ADHD, and this app is a game changer for helping me name my emotion. I love the user interface and how easily it integrates with the Health App. Seeing how my physical health interacts with my mental health is very helpful. The app is also visually pleasing which keeps me engaged."
5,Nekaybaw 💕,"Amazing app! I truly recommend this app for anyone looking to better understand and keep track of their emotions. Since using this app, I’ve come to understand exactly what I’m feeling (or close to) and it’s helped me so much with self control. I also LOVE that the app is FREE and ACCESIBLE to everyone! God bless the developers & creators of this wonderful app! A blessing! ❤️"
5,Sydney Simnitt,This app has been very helpful in tracking my moods and seeing how long I’m in each state for. I’ve been mood tracking with my therapist and found this app and it’s WAY better than writing it down each day. Looking at the analysis over time and my trends has been very insightful on my self-awareness journey.
4,brina 💀,"this app is rlly a great way to express your feelings!! if you don’t have anyone to talk to or need or want to learn more abt emotions this app has hot you covered, and sometimes it’s just nice to compare how you feel in the morning to how you feel in the afternoon! you can also check in whenever you have time, and you can set a schedule so maybe you get home from work at 3:30 and want to check in, you can!! this app will send you a notification to remind you “hey, let’s check in and see how you feel” it won’t say that, but it will say something similar. i honestly could go on and on abt this awesome app, but i people to figure out everything else that’s great abt this app!!"
5,alex norrenberns,"I’m in love with this app and the joy it has brought to my life, as well as those around me. I got my friends and family to download it. It is nice to get notifications on how they are doing. and i love how simple it is. 10/10 reccomend. Thank you to the team who made this"
5,8/11/22,"Last night around 9 maybe? My iPhone kept pinging with notifications for a check in from this app. I don’t know if it was this app, or my phone that made it happen. But it was as if someone was calling and it never stops. That’s how fast the notifications happened for 4-5 minutes straight."
4,Justsayingthisis,I enjoy this app but I do wish there were more options for feelings. I know there’s a good amount already but I still sometimes feel like I can’t find one that accurately describes how I’m feeling in the moment. I just pick the closes one then leave a note stating how I was actually feeling. Like I’m not always high or low energy and meh isn’t a middle ground enough descriptor for me
4,Typefreak,I’ve been using this app for a month and it’s been helpful. I use the reminder setting so it checks in with me at certain times in a day to see how I’m doing- this is something that I’ve been trying to do lately.  The only thing is I wish that we could add our own feelings because I feel limited by the current selection.
5,Bearperson🧸,This app is really helpful and good for you. It is a way to channel your emotions and it has great words that you can add to your vocabulary. If you ever put in that you have anger or sadness the app suggests videos you can watch to make you feel better. I like this app a lot and I would definitely recommend it. Thank you!
5,Rafic.kd,As a life coach I always encounter moments where people are stuck and couldn’t identify how they feel let alone the why. How We Feel is a great tool to support and empower people of all walks of life and age to identify and get in touch with their feeling in order to grow both emotionally and mentally
3,rernyc,"I’m writing this review because there is no contact listed whatsoever on the developer website and Apple also won’t let me report an issue. I’ve only been on maybe three days, and now today every time I attempt to open the app, it shuts down immediately. The previous days it was fine. If this continues, I will be deleting the app. Could have been a helpful app."
5,jeremy studebaker,"This app is great. Most apps like this make you pay so it’s honestly great that this one is free! The user interface is super clean and looks great. The color choices for the different emotion categories don’t make total sense to me, but that’s such a personal preference thing that I can’t fault them for it. That’s really my only gripe about this app too."
5,M2DNA,this app helps me out so much. Helps me label. The emotions I’m feeling helps me to track of my days helps me realize that my emotions are dependent on so many variables. I love that it connects to the Apple Watch and my workouts and the weather. my only suggestion is that it connects to the new Apple feelings journal.
5,Melis811,I love the ability to have random notifications and reminders to check in! It will give me a better idea of how I’m doing on a regular basis and not just when I think of checking in. So helpful to get connected to myself. And I love the tips for regulation as well. Thanks so much for your work on this!
5,"Would be five, but","It has the perfect opportunity to track my moods and also my mental state at the time I’m writing, has a place for notes to add more detail. I wish I could log past days. I often forget to log my days when I’m notified bc I’m super busy. I just hate missing days because I was busy"
4,KMGs Mom,"This app is amazing. I love that it captures so many aspects that can contribute to how you are feeling …where you are, who you are with, the weather , etc. I also love that you can add a photo, voice note or jot down a few words about what’s going on when you do your check-ins. The videos are great too. I told my therapist about this app so she could share it with other clients."
5,A’Lyah,"I’m going through trauma therapy, and one of the things we need to be aware of is our mood. Being able to track my mood and the data along side it literally helps with that. Ive been using this app for a year now, and I’m going to recommend this to my support group."
4,Zari_Kayy,Love this app so far! The concept is brilliant. It’s not like anything I’ve seen before. One suggestion for the developers: allow us to select multiple “what are you doing” items since we are sometimes doing more than one thing at a time. (Ex: listening to music and painting)  I couldn’t find a “contact us” anywhere so I’m leaving this feedback here :)
4,Safish,"Ive found this app helpful and shared with my therapist, shes been recommending it to her other clients too! Its a great way to check in with myself, just take a minute, get more grounded and aware.   I do feel sometimes like the categories aren’t exactly how i feel, sometimes “meh” can be more neutral to me than negative for example.   I also think it would be easier, instead of the shapes that dont really mean anything to me, if you could use the first few letters of a word instead so at first glance, the “all the emotions you felt” area made more sense. Example here would be just using a circle or square with “apa” for apathetic, something like that.   Thanks for what youre doing! 💚"
5,cocoloco911,"This app has helped my life substantially for the better. The real life tools and education I can instantly use are incredibly helpful. I can’t recommend it enough. Every human needs this app, I had my kids get it too. So grateful for it. The videos and lessons are so professional and helpful. Literally therapy in my pocket."
5,Maia22,"The app is 10/10. This is great for “tagging” your emotions to your entries and visualizing trends of what may be causing your mood to fluctuate. However, the check-in font was perfectly fine. Now I feel like I can only open the app in the privacy of my own home now that it’s so big."
3,DapperGordy,"Hi, I am liking the app so far. However I have accidentally added an entry for the evening upon waking and there doesn’t seem to be a way to edit/remove the entry, via the app or via the Apple health app. There is no FAQ or way to see how to easily contact the developers to find this info. I also am concerned that I cannot see this data in the Apple health app in order to have control over my medical/mental health info. Answers from the devs would be great"
5,hollycmh1,"The app is so simple to use and doesn’t make it so complex and overwhelming to log your emotions like other apps usually do. The colors are a great way to make it visually appealing and they send you a weekly report of your emotions and what you were doing, and it’s all FREE!!!! This app is far superior than the other mental health apps! Love it"
5,JMCoach7,"This app provides a fun way to become curious about our emotions, no matter what they are. Short videos provide good distinctions and information to help us become more emotion scientists rather than emotion judges.  The idea of honing in on emotions by using level of energy combined with a “pleasant” or “unpleasant” rating is genius."
5,MicLZU,"It would be great if multiple people in our family could log in and out of the app, having separate accounts, or some other way to choose who is recording an emotion. My kids are learning a lot from this but they don’t have their own devices."
4,ranch th*t,"I think the range of feelings is great as it is, but sometimes I’m not feeling particularly good or bad, just completely neutral low energy. Maybe add an “unaffected” or “neutral”.  I wish they had more middle ground emotions rather than good vs bad. Looking at my feelings log at first glance would not give you real insight into how I’m feeling, because I’ve had to pick inaccurate ones."
4,FloridaFashions,This is a really decent app- except it’s missing a feeling for something related to anxiety- and that’s killing it for me- none of the existing feelings mean anxious not even close.  The buttons for the emotions could be split in half and you could have double of them and I know you’re trying to keep it KISS - but we need at least some thing to represent anxiety
1,jorepatilu,"I installed the app, set up my reminders and checked in for one day. Then there seems to have been an update and now I can’t open the app. It crashes immediately upon trying. Doesn’t matter if it’s through clicking on the app icon or the notification, the app will not open. Very disappointing.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled app. I’m able to open the app but of course lost everything I’d already entered. I’m leery about tracking anything, if the next update is going to cost me all my entries again."
5,brentemi,The feeling of the app in your hand with the haptic feedback and the design and flow is extremely impressive. I cannot wait to introduce this app into my daily routine. Having a home base to concentrate on mental health with an easy to use but gorgeous interface is exactly what I’ve been looking for. I am ecstatic and can’t wait to unlock my insights
4,in ma feels,My friend recommended that we do this app together and now I’ve been getting all of my friends to do it. It’s such a great way to be able to track my emotions in a fun way while also learning how to define how I feel.  My only recommendation would be to be able to have your friends see your notes. You can maybe make a setting so it’s optional too.
5,Jordache01,"This is a wonderful app. As a therapist, using this app has been helpful in tracking my moods during the day. I enjoy the learning because there is validation in that.  I have presented the app in my DBT for the therapist group and the DBT group that I led and also to the individual clients that I see. This is very helpful in many ways."
3,Crimson Snow,"1.  Didn't know I could access additional emotions via the search icon that cannot be found on the grid until I read other reviews.  2. Grid is difficult to navigate in Voiceover, and I couldn't figure out how to scroll down during the ""What were you doing"" page.   I still enjoy using the app, but the interface could use more work."
4,Natalie E F,"I love this app and the new features with the journal area, weather, sleep, and excessive input is super helpful! I check in about 2 times a day. One thing I would add would be a like a grey space in the middle area for like “numb”. The app already has disconnected, but I don’t associate that with a “blue” feeling. Or adding like “insane” could be helpful for those days 😂"
5,Timmmy D,This is a solid app. The analytics are so helpful for tracking your emotions over time to notice patterns. Choosing a second emotion could be more intuitive. It would be helpful if the second emotion took you back to the primary interface for the emotion rather than just listing them alphabetically.
5,Iluvmy5c,"i just got this app a couple of days ago, and so far it’s been great. it’s like an on the go therapist and it’s quick, easy, and efficient. this is app is good for people who have a lot on their mind and can’t all explain (aka me), and it lets you pick more than one emotion depending on how you feel which i think is cool."
5,Indiemule,I love this app it helps me journal how I’m feeling which is great cuz I love journaling periodically but not consistently all based on how I’m doing. The reminders this app sends here and there are a plus and the simplicity and flexibility of choosing your own tags etc is a bonus + the videos are also very informative which I appreciate. Thanks yall ❤️
5,KGrambo,I am enjoying how quick and easy it is to record my emotions several times throughout the day. I am finding it very helpful to be prompted to spend a few minutes checking in with myself which is providing clarity and is reducing anxiety.
4,ilyniso,"As someone who try’s to practice emotional regulation daily and be mindful of what I’m feeling in the present, this is great. I have a long history in the mental health world and I like how this is phrased, and the words you have available to you. I wish you could add words to your own personal emotional dictionary. I also wish iOS had widgets. Otherwise great!"
5,Jenny4KRN,"This is so easy to use, I absolutely love the descriptions of all the feelings! It’s really given me so much more perspective in how many different feelings we as humans do and can feel! This is a great tool to understand those, see trends and learn more with the short lessons provided! I’ve shared it with my husband, my teenagers and friends!"
3,Hk111111111,I like this app for its colorful array and variety of emotional descriptors. What I don’t care for is the intrusive nature of the “information” it offers. These short pieces stop a person from describing all of their emotions first and giving them a visual overview. If the app wants to push information I would put it after the experience and allow more choice about whether a person wants suggestions at all!
5,Justaperson00000,"I love this app. It’s completely free, simple, and it works. Though there is one thing, I feel like there should be a neutral category. Since people aren’t always feeling happy or sad or a more intense emotion, I feel like adding a neutral category could help people get their emotions across better."
5,memories_ayodj,I suffer from a lot of mental health issues and I don’t wanna go to therapy due to my anxiety. But this app is my holy trinity!! I stumbled on it and it has really changed my outlook on every aspect of my life!! I’m more mature more calm and I’ve gotta out of soooo much trouble!! Thank you this app today I can say innovation change a humans life for good
5,Izziesit_,I’ve loved using this app to get a quick check in and look at the insights and it helps name specific emotions since there are so many options. But the journaling upgrade is amazing. I usually journal on my own but I love the prompts. Can’t wait to see what else they think of.
5,Laryssa is my name,Hello I love the app and everything about it. I want to get in to all the tools available but when I click on that section to see the different tools it force closes the app. I’ve tried re downloading the app and it’s still happening.
5,jeskahp,As someone who struggles with depression and even sometimes emotional awareness this app does a great job on giving me some perspective onto my feelings. It shows I have a lot more happier moments than I realize and helps me reflect on my various emotions. I definitely recommend if you struggle with any sort of mood disorder!
4,Dywn Calder,"My friends and I have been using this a lot and it’s super helpful to be able to read each others emotions and help if needed. We have noticed, however, that not all the things we feel fit in the pre-set emotions. I think it would be a super cool idea if users could add their own custom emotions and set the color and whatnot."
2,Fun153789,"Where did all the old cognitive skills go? The app updated and poof, a bunch of coping skills went away. There was like 30 before with written and guided videos by a bunch of different people. Now the only videos I can find are the movement based ones (which are amazing) and I would like the others to use as well. PLEASE BRING BACK ALL THE GREAT VIDEO GUIDED SKILLS!!! I loved using them, especially the gratitude knock. Exploring those thoughtful skills is what made the app worth while for me."
5,Lor-Reen ❤️,Throughout the day I’m sure we ALL have so many different emotions and a lot of time we don’t exactly know what that emotion is. This app Haley’s break down what your feeling. It keeps track of all your emotions throughout the day and gives you some advice on how to work through those emotions. SUPER HELPFUL!
5,Soleanna14,"I’ve been on a journey to find a good journaling/mental health app for myself, and all of them have the same fate: Neat ideas, but anti-consumer premium models, with the free version being so stripped down you might as well use a physical journal.  HWF is completely free, and better than most premium apps like Daylio. No ads, and full of features. It’s like the developers actually care about their users mental health! Any other app would lock all the lessons behind a paywall, but those are completely free—and there’s a lot of them.  Huge fan of this app already. All it’s missing is some widgets, and it’d be absolutely perfect!"
5,GLAMd0lll,I love this app. It’s helped me learn how to name so many of my emotions. Now I think of deeper things rather than just “sad” or “happy” or whatever. I love the color scheme and the quadrants as well. It’s helpful to have as a framework. I do wish that I could recover a missed streak like on Duolingo but alas.   Keep up the great work!
5,Hawaii 🌺🏝️,This app has helped my handle my emotions so well. It gives you a huge variety of emotions to choose from and gives you videos that can help along the way. Overall totally recommend this app to anyone and everyone. It’s completely free and you wont regret it!
1,Echerniss,"I have a screen shot but can’t submit here. When you select 2 emotions (the max the app currently allows) the “submit” button takes over the screen and I can’t click on all the who/where/what options without just closing it.   There are workarounds as the end user, but as a person with bipolar, this negatively impacts my experience as it stirs my mania, and while depressed I would be more likely to just give up and use the app less"
4,Revista99,"I enjoy this app, it is very useful in helping me identify the emotions I have each day and how I can let them flow more freely. I think that this app would be more effective if it had few more tools and videos to help with balancing my mood. That being said I think this app is a good choice for daily self reflections!"
5,meeeeeeeeeeeegan,I don’t normally write reviews but I am incredibly impressed and happy with this app from just my first use. It has an absolutely wonderful layout and it’s super easy to track moods. It has a wide range of moods to choose from. I am so grateful that this app is free and I immediately shared it with my loved ones.
5,Tiny pianofhjdkzjdbf,"This easy to use and intriguing UI makes logging my emotions seamless. It has become integrated in my routine. I would love to see this become a widget especially with the new friends feature, it would be great to see my friend’s emotions on my homescreen!"
5,Griffin184448,"I never write reviews, but I believe in this app so much. Simply tracking your emotions throughout the day is so helpful. And the short meditations and lessons are incredibly useful and easy to follow because of their message and length. The fact that is also free is amazing. Highly recommend."
5,If dancing was easier it would be called football,"I’ve been through countless types of therapy, medications, lifestyle change attempts (it’s hard ok), over the past 14 years. This is the first thing that I’ve used where I noted a difference in how I was handling my emotions.  Keep up the good work. Looking forward to how it continues to improve my life!"
5,Befree2023,I have bpd bipolar disorder and PTSD. This app helps me so much throughout the day to identify and even work through the emotions that I’m feeling. The AI reflections are extremely helpful and help ease my uncomfortable emotions or go deeper on the pleasant ones. Absolutely recommend this app especially if you’re struggling with emotional dysregulation.
5,Tate!!!!,"Sleek, engaging, and easy to use!!! Super helpful as someone in therapy & recovering from PTSD looking to efficiently track my daily habits. The vast array of emotions listed is wonderful, and the little definition for each one is such a simple but great addition. The app is specific to you but not overwhelming, and I love that. Thanks!"
5,DarkestMonarch,Dude! Literally I got the app because of a huge emotional rut I was in and it turned my mind around when it came to looking objectively at how I was feeling and what I could do about it. Definitely keeping this and using it in the future. Ssooooo awesome that it’s free too!!!!
5,juicetubes,"Never written an app review until now, but I enjoy this app so so much and would LOVE to be able to also track the weather so that I could see the effect it has on my emotions:) If that were to be added I believe this would be honestly the most perfect app. And by far the prettiest!"
4,0cupthecake0,great app but there's too many bugs - it won't save my tags for where i am who i am with and it keeps logging the same sleep over from days and when i change the hours it still remains at the diff time. I've re input both of those things for the same day again and again but it won't save
3,Melishaj,The app was crashing for me this morning and I couldn’t figure out how to save it. After restarting my phone multiple times I decided to take the app off and put it back on. Now all my data from the last year of using the app is gone. I am so sad. Please make it so we can login if something like this happens again or if we get a new device 😭
5,Chwrd,"This app is just what I’ve needed. Easy to use. Helpful placement of feelings definitions. Perfectly easy method for recording what experiences are affecting my emotions. Amazing reports. Helpful, practical and well produced tools for coping. Ability to share feelings with friends and loved ones. It really is unbelievable."
3,nasty_hag,I really enjoy the app and use it daily and find it a good resource to be able to really check in with myself and be more intentional with that. However more than half the time when I go to check in they do not have the specific feeling I am feeling! I would like to see more feelings built out in check in area.
5,NOTABOTISWEAR00,"I have used many different mood tracking apps but this is by far the best. I now have a streak of 30 days, most of which have two emotions per day. Thats basically all from me but i highly recommend using this app."
4,Human #453,"I’m not sure if there’s a reason for this but there are no emotions for guilt, shame, self-conscious, etc. Is that because it’s a feeling based on interacting with others? It says a lot that I’m even having to ask this but i feel like I’m missing the mark during check ins because those choices aren’t available 😂"
3,SusieQueeee,"First time using app. First information is rating your feelings. While reading & picking my appropriate responses answer on screen slowly recede, could be my problem. But after choosing and hitting continue half of the answers that appear are not the answers I picked. There’s no reason to continue if app has picked up false answers. I’ve continued to delete app & try again, same results. Suggestions?"
5,baerrynuts,"I’m someone who tends to forget to do things like this, but I haven’t missed a day since I set this up. Check-ins are quick and easy, so even if I’m busy I have time to fill it out. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to feel more in-tune with their emotions!"
5,vynniegirl✨,I really like this app! i’m a teenage swimmer and volleyball player and i get stressed and overwhelmed and excited and just about everything so this app really helps me figure out what i’m feeling and analyze it! i would highly recommend this app to anyone who is a athlete and or struggles with big emotions!
5,APurpleCow,"I’ve found this app helpful for keeping a record of my emotions throughout the day/weeks and for learning how to live with my fluctuating emotions.    Also, I love the colors and design. Kudos to the artistic and app designers! The color coding really helps with visualization."
4,Matthew Alex,I think this is a great app. I’ve been working on logging emotions for a few months now through various apps and this is the first to not only have a range of emotions but descriptions for each. There are a few things I’d love to see in the apps future.  1: The ability to share all journal past and future with friends of your choosing.  2: Maybe a calendar view of past entries that you can click into.  3: A custom emotion option for those super niche ones.  4: Integration into apple health.  These are not cons by any means I’d just love to see them and can’t wait to see the journey this app has.
5,l o.xxxx,"A wonderful app that helps you take a little bit of time each day to consider your feelings and unpack them. Lots of really helpful videos, and nothing is locked behind a paywall. Amazing stuff from a team that I really think cares about their user base."
2,FosterEee,"The privacy policy indicates that any personal information that a user voluntarily records(like my mental health status and journaling) will be collected, which is really concerning. I want to track my mental health without worrying about my data being collected . It's also really creepy that it constantly tries to know my demographic info. The app design and resources are great, but I can't trust it until it improves its privacy policy (i.e. no personal info should be collected by default)."
5,Bimmerguy84,"This app incorporates some impressive metrics for tracking and identifying what specific situations led to specific emotions, and if you include 2-3 daily updates, after 1 month you’ll learn more about yourself than years of therapy could provide. What’s more amazing? It’s FREE! Incredible…"
5,I am like so awesome!!?&$(),This app is literally one of the best things I have on my phone! I love getting to share my feelings with my friends and family and it has really helped me realize how I’m feeling and why the little videos are very helpful! Thank you for making this app it is literally the best thing ever!
5,nae 🧚🏽‍♀️,I used the Mood Meter app for a period of time and for starters I didn’t like the interface of it. Gave me school vibes where they had the emotions chart LMAOO. but this one is actually interactive and lets you add pictures and voice notes?? AND educates you on various topics relating to emotion? say no more
4,St Newt,"I love this app, it has already helped me process big feelings in the short time I have had it. However, I have noticed that no matter how late I set my last check in reminder (tried from 8pm-2am) it always labels it ""Evening"" which makes it impossible to get the ""Late Night"" data in my analytics."
5,LoFiRomero,"I really like this app but it's missing one thing -- a way to manually add data. I have been using other apps to track my moods before I found this one so I'd like to import or add that information into How We Feel somehow. Other than thag, amazinf!"
5,Miss Dee M.,"I like the easy interface and the way this app is laid out. I’ve used other mental health apps but they were overwhelming to navigate, so eventually I would just fall off of doing it. I can actually check in several times a day with this one."
5,AyeMoney$,"I am Amazed at how helpful, insightful and engaging this app is. I truly can’t say enough. In just a week of using the app I find myself not becoming overwhelmed by emotions I can’t explain nearly as much. I feel more in control and more aware of what I’m feeling with the help of the app.  Very cool stuff, thank you!"
5,faith soriano,I like to keep a record of how I feel and why I felt that way on that day and time. It's great that this has a voice recording feature which is great when I can't type out my feelings. It's been helping me evaluate my emotions and I love that it is free and helping a lot of people!
5,❤️Keira Anne❤️,I can not put into words how amazing this app is. It has helped me so much to really understand my feelings and how to deal with them. I can not believe that it is entirely free no money whatsoever. The only way is to donate. If I could I would donate a million dollars. This is truly the best app in my phone.
5,Sylvesterm108,"As someone who has only been able to feel and identify anxiety, overwhelmed, and exhausted… this app is amazing. The push reminders help me to log what I’m feeling in those random moments throughout the day in order to better recognize and understand my emotions."
4,Winnie the who is that?,Oh my gosh its so ugly.   I used to have neat square boxes for my pictures but now its like?? Instagram stories and its the whole background and you can barely read the words on it and you have to press the more button just to read what youve wrote. It’s just an awful update and you really shouldnt fix whats not broken.
5,BilboAtkins,"If anyone has any trouble coming up with more than 10 adjectives for their feelings, then they should use this app. Human nature says that we are better able to cope with stress and anxiety if we can name how it is making us feel I recommend this app."
5,CHmyCH,Great app. App keeps crashing after updated to ios 17. Updated the application and my ios system. App still crashes at launch. Tried offloading and reinstalling but still not working.
4,Nox Box,"Awesome mood tracking and robust tools. Just wish there was a more simple analysis feature. Like, calendar-style for an easy overhead view of daily “colors”.  I appreciate the current breakdown by factors (weather, time of day, etc) and quantity of moods/check-ins but a more general look would be more helpful i think!"
5,LilyOfTheValley0,I have tried so many mood tracking/journaling apps and none of them ever seemed to stick…until this one. I often have trouble putting my feelings into words and this app has helped me so much. So simple and so effective! I love it!
5,daizytrix,I’ve been struggling with my anxiety and mental health lately and I really like how the app works. I’m learning that I would get myself all worked up over nothing because the more check in’s I do throughout the day better I feel. 😌
5,Lolcantthinkofone,It’s hard for me to put emotions into words and this app has them all its great reflection for how my days go/ what areas in my life tend to have the same emotions. It has exercises to help when feeling certain emotions and i haven’t seen any ads yet. Truly and incredible app im so glad i use it
5,Polo101ehhdhdjd,The more I use this app the more I learn about how I am feeling and why I am feeling the way that I am. Thank you for those helping this company to make this app free for anyone. It is important for us to learn about our feelings so we can learn more about ourselves and help others.
5,allirion,I looovveeee this app. I have recommended it to everyone ik. It has helped me understand my emotions so much better. I have bipolar 2 and it is incredibly helpful. It is an AMAZING way to journal if you can’t keep up with writing everyday. Absolutely amazing app. If I could give it 10 starts I would
4,Old lady gardener,I would give this app a five star rating except for the fact that every time I want to use it I have to launch the app between 10 and 20 times before it actually opens. I'm running the most updated version of the app. This is really irritating. Otherwise I love the app!
5,lsjuebrnjif,This app has been really nice to have as a little reminder to check in with myself. I’m starting to think that this whole emotion thing is a bit less complicated than I once thought. 10/10
5,AM Mitchell,"I’ve been looking for a great, free, mood tracker and this app checked all the boxes! It’s well-made and easy to use, but also very effective! This app is great for recognizing patterns in your moods and figuring yourself out. Honestly, I was super shocked to find out that this app is completely free — it’s amazing! I couldn’t be happier :)"
5,lillianagrace22,"I love this app! Has seriously changed my life and I am quickly on the way to becoming an emotion scientist instead of the judge I’ve been since I can remember. So grateful that it is free, with no ads and has the most helpful information. The developers of this app deserve an award."
5,slimyspores,"I love how it forces you to sway away from neutral when identifying your emotions. There are low intensity emotions to chose from, but this challenges you to stay in touch! I wish I had their full emotion spectrum to use as a poster in my classroom. It would be perfect for the kids."
5,Juanchiisafk,"I love the app and appreciate your values as team. Thank you for working on this important project. I have two points of feedback:  1) The tags are currently, what are you doing, who are you with, and where are you. But sometimes I wish I could capture what is on my mind making me feel this way. Which could be different from what I am doing. Was this intentional?   2) Apple Health I know that you read Apple Health data. Are you all considering writing back to Apple Health? It would be nice to have these mindful moments captured there as well."
4,tyler hernadi,"this app is really great, its helped me specify what i’m feeling and provides an opportunity for me to “talk” about my emotions without having to worry about burdening whoever i’m talking to. however there are oftentimes that i’m feeling something that isn’t an option, so I have to choose an emotion that only sort of fits that feeling."
5,Zartavion,"I love this app, not only because it is very well done. But because there are no ads trying to take my money. And it doesn’t cost me to use it. And by using it I am helping my mental health! That easily gets a 5 stars in my book!!!"
5,davidjtemple,This is a great app. You can keep track of how you feel every day and then watch videos and see analytics that help you understand those feelings better—and know what to do about them. I love this app!
5,mash001123,Helps organize my emotions easier and find really interesting patterns in my day to day feelings. Also really beautiful UI and it’s fun to interact with it. I would love to see some future updates with more feelings available to choose from.
5,Grackalack,"I absolutely love this app, but I would love to have a simple widget for iPhones to remind me more often to check in!! Thank you for making this app. It’s helped me identify and work through why and what is making me feel a certain way. So thank you again!!"
4,Mars❤️🍄,"I love this app, I just recently downloaded it & it’s exactly what I was looking for, but I wish it was more inclusive per say? I’m 16 & it says for 18 & up, but that simply doesn’t make sense. Everyone has feelings that they can’t identify or describe, not only would it be moral to out reach to the people younger than 18 but it’d be a good selling point to families."
4,Rollsbud13,"One of the best abs I ever had in my life, really helping me keep track and as I keep track, everything’s keeps getting better and better and better and I love it my life is good I love everybody. I love this app I love everyone I hope everyone can feel like I feel windy. It’s really a blessing truly a blessing and I’m really thankful to the Lord above."
5,jamiengel33,I’ve had this app for a week and I’m already such a fan! I’ve told everyone I know! It’s a great way to take a second and check in with yourself! I can’t wait to have more data in there to see the trends in my life. Very user friendly and pleasing to the eye.
3,heyarleyann,"I’ve loved this app sooo much and use it consistently for tracking my moods with my cycle, different meds, and so much more. But I’m super bummed that all of a sudden all my tags are gone for what I’m doing, who I’m with, and where I’m at. Even downloaded my data for just in case and it’s all gone… hoping it’s just a bug and will come back with the next update 🤞🏼☹️"
5,Wderftg,"I love this app so far because I can track how I feel around certain people and in certain situations so I can make changes based on data instead of getting so confused about complex, enmeshed relationships."
5,Wolfsong3,I love this app it is so helpful esp for autistic people I do wish you could create your own emotions to add in as id like it to log when I have a meltdown but other than that this app has been so helpful not only with recognizing emotions but also communication
5,（＾。＾@）,"I use this app on my phone and iPad and I log info in daily, but it won’t show what I logged on my iPad when I’m on the app with my phone (vice versa) idk if this can be changed but that is the only comment I have!!!"
4,639953947,"I sometimes feel joyful for monks others. It is positively satisfying and did not hurt anyone. Sometimes, I feel relief for others have the same bad feelings with me. It is make me feel lighter. But i can not find the suitable word in this app. Please add more complex feeling word, especially the positive feeling but caused by negative way."
5,EverythingisGod,"Having anxiety and depression makes it imperative to track my mood, and this is the perfect app for that. The way they categorize emotions makes it very easy to understand what’s going on with my mood, and the analysis section is great for retrospection! Love this app so much, thank you!"
5,Grailz,I was looking for an emotions wheel app and stumbled upon How We Feel and have been so pleasantly surprised by its offerings.   Emotions wheels I’ve used in the past simply list the names of emotions but didn’t do much to explain what those names (emotions) meant. I found myself going to the dictionary do decipher.  How We Feel seems much more intuitive and a more efficient use of my time. The included videos that are designed to help users be more aware and in touch with their emotions are also very much welcomed.  Highly recommend!
5,Артём Шураков,I’ve been using this app for quite a time and it’s absolutely amazing! I just can’t describe how useful it is and interesting too! Having an ability to view all analysis and also to add media to entries is so helpful! Thank you for your efforts!
5,nfernandez48,I love this app! I’ve suggested it to quite a few clients. I use it myself and find it to be a helpful mood check-in. I’m also really enjoying the educational videos that are unlocked as I progress with my check ins. Fantastic.
5,Utah Teacher,"I do not write review either, but this app is easy to use.  I am beginning to see some trends I would never have thought about.  I am doing this for my emotional mindset and well being, as I tend to neglect how I feel while devoting my time to everyone else."
3,Arieavart,"i’m glad other people are having the same problem as me, i was worried it was just my phone being weird. but yeah, i’ve been trying for at least a week now to get into the app, but every time i try it just kicks me back to the home screen. there’s an opening animation for it now that wasn’t there last time i tried, but the app still doesn’t open. i’ve tried everything short of deleting the app because i don’t want to delete my data, so i’m hoping the problem will get fixed eventually. until then, it’s unusable for me :( other than that, though, i’ve loved using the app, it’s really great."
5,cactuscallan,"This app has really blown me away. Not only from its stellar design, but because it really makes me think about my feelings in a way that I hadn’t before. Such a great tool while diving into therapy and I can’t wait to see the correlations it’ll show over time!"
5,Alison McDonald,This is a great app that can help with emotional literacy. It definitely helps me to notice patterns in my emotions and the reminders help me to pause and take time to be mindful of what I’m feeling and even what’s going on around me. This app is a really great tool to utilize and help you gain insight on your own personal feelings!
5,Roadrunner2674,"I’ve tried so many different apps for tracking, and this is by far the best I’ve found. I’ve only had it for a few days but I’m excited to see more of the features as time goes on!"
4,Master Reviewer03,I love this app. It’s like having your own personal Digital journal that helps you label your emotions. The only problem I have is every time I try to go to the “Tools” Section the app crashes and send me to my Home Screen on my iPhone 11. Please fix this bug I want to keep using the app to its fullest extent!! 🫶🏽
5,MegaMeg2323,This app is so sleek and easy to use. It can gather an insane amount of stats and displays them in such a visually appealing way. I cannot believe that it is completely free. It has helped me be more in tune with my body; I’ve been recommending it to everyone I know!
5,OliverIsASquid,"This is truly an amazing app. The features are all super great, it’s very easy to use, and incredibly useful. It makes me feel more aware of my emotions and day. The skills it suggests are genuinely useful. It also is unburdened by paywalls or ads, making it a refreshing reprieve. This is the best app I have."
5,OpieH,"I've tried several ""calming"" and meditation apps. This one goes way beyond any I've been aware of. I've just started using it, but can already tell how helpful and valuable it will be. So glad I downloaded it and will donate to support it. 😌"
5,beebooboobebeboop,Usually journaling feels like a chore but this app allows me to really focus on the important things (how I’m feeling) easily and conveniently throughout the day and also allows me to check back on my history and detect patterns. Great tool for life right here!
1,Segmented,"The app starts you off with many videos centered around how you think you’ll feel about your current problem(s) in 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year. They imply that you’ll feel better. People with chronic illness, people like me, have no hope of getting better. There is no cure. I will be sick for the rest of my life.  Maybe add some clear options and dialogue for people struggling with mental illness caused by physical illness."
5,Susan Mariiie,"I was referred to this app by my 13 yo daughter , and I’m a 35 yo single mom of 5. I referred the app to my bd who is 34. We all enjoy the app and are already learning new things. I think everyone should be in therapy but for whatever reason, if you can’t make that happen, try this app."
5,HayashiYuna333,"i love how you can check in multiple times a day and how it doesn't take up much time to do so - compared to other mood tracking apps i've tried, this is veryyy easily my favorite. i love how it lets you visualize emotions - makes it so much easier to identify how i feel. i love how it doesn't have pop ups, like ones for a subscription - all features are already available. i love how it tracks your mood over time periods, and displays them in such a visual way - so insightful. thank you so much for this awesome app :)"
5,jonny<3syou,A friend told me about this app and it has been soooo helpful! I kept promising I would journal but this seems to motivate me to at least make notes about how I’m feeling. The voice message option is also awesome.
5,awesome girl is the best,This app has been so helpful to me!! I love that everything is free and that you can check in as many times as you want. I’ve already checking 69 times!! I love the new updated version as well. Thank you so much How We Feel committee!!
4,Krazykda100,"I love this app, my therapist recommended to me to help better discover how I feel about things and during the day but every time I go to the use the tools tab to see what else the app has to offer it keeps kicking me out! Idk what to do but everything else is good"
5,E4pres,"I appreciate the simplicity of this app—the fact that I can not only select an emotion but educate myself on the emotion at the same time is really cool. So far, I have nothing negative to say. This app is helping me in small but influential ways. I love it! ❤️ Keep up the amazing work!"
4,Cassi.Nelso12345,"This has been such a great way to connect with my long distance friends. 10/10 recommend   I would love to be able to comment on my friends emotions, as well as be able to see the emotions they have logged throughout the day."
4,CLH32812,"It’s an easy-to-use app that has allowed me to keep brief journal entries throughout my day, monitoring my moods. I would love more feeling options (or ability to write in your own words), and / or the ability to choose how to color-code feelings. It’s a great app otherwise, and love that it’s free (with no ads!)"
5,my grouthsprt,"I love keeping track of habits and watching data, and I’ve always wanted to create things like this, but never really tried. I love all the features that track data. I also love how there’s such a wide range of different emotions!"
5,HonHI808,"To whom ever subsidized this app: Thank you VERY much!  EVERYONE in the whole world needs it. If people haven’t started yet, people should start translating it!  Thank you, Dr. Brackett, for your book (Permission to Feel), for sharing your stories of your Uncle Marvin, and for this app."
5,JC95831,I’m hoping developers will resolve the crashing so that I don’t have to remove and reinstall (and lose data). Please fix this. Couldn’t find how else to send a defect   Otherwise love this app
5,raisingcaneshasmywholeheart,I really do enjoy this app. My friend made me download it but it’s fun to check in and also see how my friends are doing. Is there a way to share the pictures and notes I take with them too?
5,bkreaderr,This app is literally changing my life. The way it’s set up for choosing my feeling makes me be more in tune we how I actually feel instead what I think I’m feeling. The mini clips offering tools are super awesome. Thank you for creating this intelligent app
5,ambrielvega,I’ve only had this app one week and I already notice a difference. Stopping to check in with myself three times a day makes me feel grounded and cared for. Please keep this free! I’ve been telling everyone I know to download it
3,Emily Rim,"I love the idea of this app, it’s super fun and helpful. I wish that we could submit other adjectives for how we feel or that there could be additional adjectives added to the grid. Sometimes I’m feeling vibey and I can’t say that :/ Please make custom emotions possible!!! And perhaps also make emotion reactions to other friends possible!!!"
5,Liamrcx,"Really like this tracker, it’s elegant and smooth with many emotions to choose from. It would be nice if a Lock Screen widget were added so you could see your SO’s status or you could quickly jump to the log screen."
5,MP5564152,"This app has helped me change my life. I can finally find a way to express my emotions, analyze my emotions, and let myself feel negative emotions in a healthy way. My negative emotions and associated thoughts are no longer dragging me down. This is a wonderful app."
5,heelyism,I wish the videos that were recommended after logging an entry could come back. They felt more alive and insightful than the new tools section. Overall love this app! Thanks so much for keeping it free.
4,DeeDee in downtown ATL,"I love this app. it’s so helpful for me with helping to define my emotions; however, I’ve encountered a few that aren’t available as options and would love to have a way to add them somehow. Any chance that could be an added option at some point in an update?"
5,Jen Mussari,"This is a really remarkably beautiful, simple app that makes it so easy and intuitive to use. I can tell I will use this for many years! I applaud everyone behind this very thoughtful app. Thank you!"
5,Mj SC,It’s nice to be asked the simple question how are you?  It’s even nicer to stop and seriously think about your answer and to answer honestly. I highly recommend it. It keeps me in check. I’m thankful to use it and the lessons it teaches me.
5,BGar3,This app is a wonderful tool to learn about emotions. I am a retired clinical social worker and know that the ability to identify emotions is a valuable tool in maintaining good  mental health. Not only does it offer an easy way to identify emotions with words but it’s also packed with educational tools. Well done!
5,Zrng Barznje,"Learning about ourselves is an important thing that every human being needs to be taught, this great app lets me take care of my feelings. Not one, not four, not ten, but hundreds of feelings!  Great app/project keep up the good work we all support this app/project together ❤️"
5,hshdj hydud,"I don’t know why this app constantly makes better of a person, I feel like it brings some type of good feeling being sure to put you’re emotions into this app, I like how realistic it is, much love ❤️"
5,Gernandt,So helpful to connect and share how we’re doing. I’m a psychotherapist and my client invited me to participate. I not only learned where she was at but also became aware my own feelings and my ability to move toward better thoughts and feelings. Empowering!
5,Dawn 🐝,"My son took His life, I didn’t want to live. Someone shared the ap w me and now I feel like if no one else cares the ap Is tracking my heart.  People don’t know what to say so they say nothing and do nothing .  Terrifying when I need my village and community"
5,Esstefa,I love this app and how easy it is to use and track my emotions. This is an amazing self care tool. I love how it describes emotions giving me an opportunity to choose the appropriate response and have an accurate depiction of what I’m Feeling in REAL TIME.
5,Josephenecat,"This app was recommended to me by my therapist and I am loving it. Not only are the lil lessons great but starting to check in on my feelings really helps you have better control over your day, what you accomplish and how you approach things."
5,mwyattf,I’ve shared this with multiple friends and we all agree it’s instrumental to our mental health and emotional awareness. I also love that it’s free! That is a game changer for me and allows me to continue to use it past a “7-day free trial”. :) So grateful for the app and it’s creators/team!
4,Taypppppxgfbxc,I only gave this a four because arm. I think we should be able to do it on watches of all electronics and so and I also wanna share it with my friend and my dad and it just won’t let me because I don’t have a Google well it says I don’t have a Google account but I do.
1,ContraGon,It’s basically the feelings wheel and about 15 videos that are supposed to help coach you through your difficult feelings. The videos are not specific to the feelings you identify and can actually be remarkably unhelpful (Carte Blanche) advice which can run counter to every single therapeutic practice. Someone clearly sunk a good bit of cash into this but hasn’t developed it beyond a prototype stage. Should be removed from the App Store for it potential for creating confusion and despair.
5,ace&jocelyn,"This is an incredibly well done app. It’s just a simple concept but for someone who has struggled to find words to describe how they feel, this is eye opening and incredibly useful. The lessons are short, sweet and easy to grasp as well."
5,Ldhdjdj,"This app helps you to identify and name specific feelings, and record and track data around when and why you felt them. It has great meditations and support videos as well, but my absolute favorite part is the AI jor"
5,Maiya the Papaya,"Learned about this app from the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Marc Brackett and have been loving it since. It’s free, quick, and extremely useful to learn to identify my emotions and learn tools to alter them. I especially like the widget that I added to my home screen!"
5,PF 1234,This app is so great for me and my relationships. I find myself excited to self-evaluate and share with others. It also helps me feel more connected to those I share with and has increased my prayer life for others.
5,whitneysjg,This app allows me to be more present in a day and age that how I feel seems unimportant compared to tasks at hand. Recognizing patterns and having the option to take inventory on what is correlated to my feelings is so empowering
2,franzeboy,"Please go back to the previous version of journaling. It was so focused, so clean. It helped me not be overwhelmed with too many options and kept my thoughts fresh to start journaling.  Now it’s just BAM 10+ entries to fill in with extra goodies you can choose to ignore.  I’ve never made a request on the App Store, but I’ve also never had as much success with a feelings journal. I LOVE How We Feel."
4,elina36,I really enjoy using this app though I feel it would be even better if we could log two emotions at a time if we wanted to. Sometimes it’s hard to just feel one emotion and u want to express at least two.
5,shumis07,"if you enjoy data tracking, this app gives you a great way to do it — the UI is beautiful and easy to work with. plus, keeping track of my emotions regularly has given me some good insights about myself"
5,shundune,"This app has made me even more hopeful for the future of humanity. I have described this to my friends as the ultimate tool, something that fits in your pocket with all the other stuff! Protect this at all costs, nurture yourself at all costs 💋"
3,Maria_OM,I love the ui and the overall experience of this app but the options for the actual emotions really only work for someone with the emotional range of a teaspoon. We’re missing a whole range of emotions from sexual desire to existential dread. Are we just going to ignore the fact that sex plays into our wellbeing in a big way?
5,CascadianPrincess,This is an incredible resource. I’m a mental health nurse and thought I understood this stuff. Turns out I needed this app to make it all click.   Thank you so much for the emotionally stability this app has helped me work towards.
5,Funny Bunny 🌸,"this app has helped me through thick and thin, I am able to explain my feelings, find strategies and watch helpful videos. It is the best app for people who need a good vent. Or just so you can process emotions. It is soooooo SO helpful and you should download it 😽🎀"
5,AesthticNeko,"I love it already. The interface is so easy to use. I like the variety in emotion identifiers, it would be cool to add our own too. It’s very basic, but simple and very nice. And FREE. It would be nice for more features to be added but I’m loving what we’ve got."
5,jhcsbsh,"This app has helped me tap into my emotions more accurately at random times in the day. I’m able to take a step back and assess the situation better, and even find out what’s triggering my bad moods. 100% recommend!"
5,poofaloof,"This app is the best thing ever, it has helped me sooo much and is very accurate and a good way to find your emotions and understand feelings. There is so much more I would like to say, but people don’t like reading long reviews. 100% recommend 🤩"
5,3Charm3d,"I’m truly enjoying this app and it has helped a lot. I’ve only being using this app for 3 days so far, but I feel I am better recognizing my feelings and how to process them."
2,CharlesC1977,"I liked using this app because it was so quick to note what I was feeling. The “enhanced” functionality has led to more steps and time to enter my check-in, so I started using it less.  Even if you skip the detail, it still adds time, so after continuing to decrease my use, I finally uninstalled it today. I’m looking for an alternative."
5,shelb-dawg,"This really is a cool app but I have one idea. I have some days where I feel multiple things at once so it’s hard for me to choose between one emotion, maybe some sort of way to add more?"
5,madzmartin,This app is amazing. Sometimes I don’t have the energy to journal and tracking can be triggering sometimes. This allows me to see overall patterns and track my emotions way better than I ever could.
1,TheXxTurlip,"The app recently added a streak feature with no way to disable it. There's also been a known bug with how text is entered into the search bar for a very long time that has not been resolved. The app has no bug tracker or forum, so there's no way to give feedback without sending an email that won't be responded to. I'd easily rate this app 5 stars if it weren't for these things."
5,Eos Dawn,I’ve been using this app for about a week now and it just keeps getting better each time I use it. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who needs it!
5,Sprite_xo,"I have been trying really hard to identify my emotions so I can regulate them better, this app has not only made it easy to identify but it’s interactive and they have really done a great job with the videos."
5,JfddbhfdQq11,"Such an ingenious app. Please make it possible to add up 2 or three more emotions at once 😂 I have a lot of emotions to process and sometimes I feel overwhelmed, embarrassed, and frustrated all at once 🤣 nearly perfect app"
2,mdruggiero,I like the app and like using the AI feature to go deeper into thoughts and feelings. The problem is that every time I’ve used it after reflecting the second time with AI i just see a blank black screen. It feels like the devs don’t really care about this app since I’m running one of the newest phones and it’s  been an issue for well over 6 months.
5,Megkea212,"I use this app to track my moods, but also to keep in touch with my friends and how they are feeling. It is a really great way to connect with others on a deeper level and to foster greater relationships."
5,LadyPrincessElena,"I love this app. I download this app as a recommended app to track my moods and try to balance myself out and understand my feelings. So far I’ve use it for a few days now and for me, it helps me a lot so far."
5,Triniti,I feel like I never quite know the exact words to express how I'm feeling but this app helps me to identify the words. I find it really helpful when checking in with my therapist about my feelings.
5,TheHypeIsDead,I love the summary pages and the lessons they unlock as a reward for checking in. really gives perspective and you can share it all w your loved ones. thank you. please continue this amazing work.
4,leonkool,"I love how simple the app is and it completely being free! Just wish it could have an Apple Watch version and widget support, would be so nice to quickly check-in without having to pull out the phone."
5,Offers Sydney,I usually suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and usually just having that twice a day reminders like OK how do you feel and how can you fix this? It has saved a lot of time and tears.
5,Seattle Jen,"I was looking to easily track my mood and energy level, and that’s exactly how this is structured, with much more detailed feelings within those segments. Easy to use with helpful tools"
5,ili_iis,"Hello,  Thank you for creating this app and updating it to make it better.  I wish I can add feelings more than 2 (which is the current limit) when I check in.  Also, I personally prefer the previous style of note entry because that was easier to write long reflection. I do like the current slider style though for encouraging me enter things like sleep hours without skipping over them.  I love this app, and I hope to see this app continue to improve."
4,RunningNurse,"Great app, however the 4 categories don’t always work for me, as I’m guessing other people as well. There needs to be more neutral feelings as I often do not fit in to high energy positive or negative and low energy positive and negative."
5,Ella in Greek,"This app really helps me track my moods during the day. And I don’t know about you, but my moods are always changing, so now I can monitor them. It also gives you helpful hints. Try it!"
5,Hitori_Samishiku,"It’s 100% free, helps you record and take note of your emotions, and even allows you to share them with others and create a circle where you can share how you all feel."
5,Thatone_chick,"I am so thankful for all of the features that this app has and that none of it is behind a paywall. It is so refreshing to see, and i’ve been loving it!! The analysis and integrations are incredible and the app is so easy to use!!"
5,fashion2021queen,I am going through a lot right now and this app has helped me to get over my panic attacks and just anxiety. It has helped me with school depression and helped me to find my voice again.
5,A. Whaley,"I am becoming a “feelings scientist” and am a recovering “feelings judge.” Slowly, I am beginning to be able to sit and feel not just inventory my feelings. It’s helping me become more compassionate towards myself and others."
5,Mom SKK,"AMAZING! I love this App! Today I am learning to name the emotions I never understood that I had.  I was happy, mad, or sad…that was the extent of my self knowledge.  Today my emotional language includes words like elated, apprehensive, serene, fearful to name a few.  Thank you so much for this App!"
5,Margo bear,This app is a great way to stay connected with yourself but also the people around you. It makes it so much easier to provide love and support to the people who need it.
5,alice dibble,The way that emotions are organized has made this the best mood tracker I’ve used. I like how emotions are along a scale of positive/negative and high/low energy; it’s a great way to provide a general overview of emotions while allowing for more specific emotions.
4,aemckean,"And now it keeps crashing. Won’t open at all. I’ve been holding off on doing a delete/reinstall, because I don’t want to lose my progress, but then what good is saving my progress in an app that no longer opens? Right?"
5,Chromachlo,This app is so awesome. I love that it’s fully functional without any annoying ads as it’s funded by donations etc. I told my therapist about the app and she wrote it down. This app is soo special. Thank you!!
5,Easy app2,This app has been great for providing helpful videos on understanding our emotions. It’s also great for journaling the current events around why you are feeling what you are feeling.
5,Rmcd1615,This app is great because I’ve always wanted to be more aware of my own emotions. The fact that it lets you choose from many different emotions helps me to pinpoint my emotion more accurately.
5,mihiker,Great app. Quick to learn. Easy check-ins that let me focus on my emotional state during the day. Short videos give helpful hints for how to improve my well-being.
5,🕷️xx_itzfern_xx🕷️,"i like this app and recommend, just a few bugs, but very playful interface and easy to use 🌸  Edit: i changed it to five stars. this app just keeps getting better and better! the ai really works well. one suggestion, though. Full screen interface. Otherwise, this is awesome. I changed my title from “Always improvement” to “Everyone needs Hwf”  near perfect mental health app. helped so much.   thank you so much! 🕺🍋✨🤟 -xx_itzfern_xx"
5,GSBpooh,The design is intuitive. It makes sense.   I love the reporting aspect of this app. It’s my favorite part. It helps me to understand my triggers visually by using graphs and several points of data. Absolutely in love!
4,Vincy_Princess,I love this app it makes it easy to track my moods. My only complaint is not having the ability to add my mood from the previous day bc sometimes I forget and it would be cool to have that option!
5,KB Board,Pausing to check in is helpful and the week in review is insightful. Very intuitive app. Helping with communication with my spouse as we both is the app separately then share what is happening with our feelings. Love it.
5,Hi 😨,It has so many emotions and you can also pick two for how you felt at the time.  It was much more better and detailed than I expected.
5,Justineheart914,i love this app because it makes me check in with my feelings and when i recognize my feelings i also recognize when i’m happy rather than focusing on when i’m sad or frustrated
4,TypopathicPsychopath,"It really helps me identify and label my own feelings so I can cope with them or manage them. I just wish that I could optionally add a severity to my emotions, or add more than two at once if that messes with statistics.  But otherwise that’s really all I’d add. It’s perfect for me except for that tiny thing."
5,Mcclvswag,I love how it checks on me cause I don’t like talking to people and explaining how I feel just stresses me out and makes me sad and anxious. This app really makes me feel safe to express myself and be my true self.
3,eeemmmgggmmmm,i love this app. but i feel subtitles for the videos would be so helpful. especially for someone like me who often feels overwhelmed and anxious by the sounds of the world. i come here to put my thoughts and feelings down and get some kind of a break and/or clarity. please put subtitles in videos so i can refrain from listening to yet another person talk at me in my already full and overwhelming day. of course a calming voice is very grounding. but for me sometimes all i really need is some silence. so thankful for what this app is trying to do here. it’s very helpful.
5,Bea: The Devourer of Nectar,HWF is so easy to comprehend and aesthetically pleasing. i’ve always wanted to record my feelings to get a gauge on what impacts my emotions. the apps i’ve used before this cost money and too much time. i highly suggest this app to ANYONE and EVERYONE
5,Anniebiogirl,I’ve granted permissions but the import function doesn’t seem to do anything. I’ve checked that it’s set up properly and restarted the app and my phone.
5,L1745D,"absolutely wonderful app if i may, more suggestions: adding feeling with definitions. I’m saying adding the ability to create a custom feeling (still following the low/high positive/negative chart!) and add a custom description."
5,Nafgrand,"I finally been able to label my feelings. In other words, the app has introduced me to know my feelings, helping me to manage and share with my psychiatrist and therapist."
5,AmyHSW,"I share this app with family , friends and children… to help them become familiar with their range of emotions and how often they really do change!"
5,E-Bassed,"My brother introduced this app to me on a whim, and I download it and just recently started using it. I can’t tell you how different it makes me feel, but the ability to acknowledge, abstract, and recontextualize my emotions, I could not begin to describe how much it helps   If you feel lonely, sad, upset Without Reason, I’d definitely check this app out. And even if you Are Upset for Any Reason, this app will help with that too  Peace and Love on Planet Earth! -Ebass"
5,UncleBenFranklin,"An app that helps your mental health unlike the countless ones that hurt it. Ps, whoever did the graphic and sound design for this app is amazing- the small bubbles and soft sounds they make literlsly made me feel calmer as I used it"
5,Dollpanda13,This app is amazing. what I like most about is it gives you video identifying the emotions you identify how do you express it is it is healthy way. and you get a document your mood change.
5,airportrusher,"Unbelievably useful tool for understanding and naming your emotions. The definitions are so helpful, the extra tools and lessons are so well put together. If everyone had this app the world would be a better place."
4,SusanJulia22,I wish there was a comment feature so I can ask my friends why they feel a certain way when they update their mood.
4,Uglydollsforever,I love this app and feel more seen when being able to put words to my daily emotions. The only downfall to this app is that they have no emotion that is numb or nothingness. Which I feel a lot but overall very good app.
5,LJac85,Love everything about this app! The fact that it is free for users but such amazing quality is awesome! So many great features to support mental health! I have recommended it to so many people!
5,Jperkins26,I attempted suicide November of 2018 when I was 20 years old. Having an app like this along with friends who will now have access to my deep intrusive thoughts will help me stay alive. Thank you for this app.
5,Jessie 25100,It's been such a great tool for me because there are definitions for all the emotions. I love that it’s completely free. I just wish you could add more than just one emotion to a single check-in.
5,Trust2Jack,This is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to better understand their own feelings. And shouldn’t everyone want to better understand their feelings? That is to say understand life?
5,mmiyer,"Genuinely one of the most incredible apps I've used, has really helped me know and regulate my emotions. One of the few health apps that actually help because it is so simple to use!"
5,LoopertonJr,"The four quadrants and the ability to label emotions is genius   Labeling emotions means you can understand what you're feeling and identify them. Often times, just being able to identify how you're feeling is enough to feel like you are okay.   I love this.   It's also a very simple app which is incredible. Too many apps these days try to make things overly complicated.   This app keeps it simple and just gets out of the way"
5,jwilczynski1977,Easy. It’s so easy to log my daily emotions.   Really love the lesson videos.   Takes about 2 minutes daily to complete.  And I am honest with myself using the logs.  Was hard for me to do but overtime was simple.
5,ellewms,"This app is incredibly handy in helping to understand, track, and regulate emotions. It’s such a simple concept but it's executed really well. Not surprised by all the great reviews and awards it's garnering. Try it out!"
5,cl3100,"I really didn’t know the words to place my emotions in. This app open my eyes. I’m also thankful that it’s a free app. There’s nothing to buy, it’s funded by donations which makes me really happy. I’m in a better space."
5,Juju6001,"as someone who struggles with mental illness, i find myself fatigued or unmotivated to journal my day, thoughts, feelings, etc. this app was the key to what i always needed. i am reminded daily to check in and i would like to say that 95% of the time i do. the check in can take as little or as much time as needed. it also helps define my feelings throughout the day with an array of color coordinated adjectives to choose from. this is by far my favorite “self help” app!"
5,Jenc269,I had the last version and wondered what happened to it… Now that I found out I’m so so happy it went away! This upgrade is exceptional.
5,jackieohmy,"It's so easy to enjoy and self-enlightening, with encouraging videos interspersed.  i also love the analytics, which helps me quantify instead of thinking that my current state is a permanent one. much gratitude for this app!"
5,/(0-0)/ |__|,"I have had so many ups and downs this week, navigating extreme social disturbances, work, and depression. I have been looking for an app like this, and this is the only one without ads. Thank you."
4,concerned about this,This app worked for me three times but now it keeps crashing upon opening. Really hope you guys can figure it out because i loved it when it worked.
5,Bakerk74,"Someplace to identify and name my feelings, articulate how I’m feeling, connect the dots of why I might be feeling that way, and tools too understand more about how feelings work and how to deal with them."
5,LKB61,Great at helping identify emotions.  The brief definition when you highlight an emotion bubble really helps me to decide if that is the emotion I am experiencing.   I like the videos that look at emotions from different perspectives.
5,laurpups,Gives you the opportunity to create space between you and how you’re feeling. Great videos to uplevel how you respond to your emotions.
5,Annicmattic,Excellent app for your mental and emotional health. I look forward to checking in and (sometimes) sharing how I feel…
5,Pianoman_jack,I got this app to quietly monitor my thoughts until I can see a professional...if that is what you're wondering about this app is the best one out of all the hundreds of choices 🙏
5,adahshav5,"i actually love this app a lot. it’s hard for me to feel determined or to remember to write in a journal everyday, but i always remember to check into this one. it’s quick, simple, and beautifully organized. i love the photo and audio feature. i always explain (through an audio) or picture on why i feel the way i do. it’s more personable and just adds a lot more creativity. this app is also good for regulating my emotions :’)"
5,Daggie619,I have my whole family using it. This app is nice way to pin point exactly “how we feel” and the app gives videos and exercises depending on the emotion feeling.
5,wjanfhjsndbfe,Thank you so much to whoever made this. It’s helped immensely with my ability to feel my emotions and the tools actually make me feel better.
5,Peacefuldolphin,This has helped our family a lot already. It’s helpful to figure out really what you’re feeling!
5,Nostalgic Nerd,i love the simplicity of the app and the statistics it provides and the emotion lessons. I wish they would bring back the ‘Ok’ and ‘Sleepy’ feelings though. Because i’m not necessarily ‘Good’ or ‘Chill’ i’m just about okay.
5,Lolcat Lisa,"I love the graphics, the wide variety of words available to describe my feelings, and the ease of capturing them.  It’s become a daily habit."
5,ChrisCorey🩵🤍,Only been here  a few Weeks and it has helped me in a lot of different ways honestly!!!! I can’t wait to see where I get with this app in just 3 months ❤️ XO CC
5,Julie Ann S,"Grateful to the scientists, doctor's, researcher's, investor's , and the platform. It is like nothing I have ever experienced. All I can say is try it. My 15 year old step son told me his therapist recommended it for him."
5,Noneaaaaaaaa,"Have found this app, helpful and reminding me to have an emotional check every once in a while.  This allows me to know what my next step I want to take."
4,MCotton24,"The app is great, however, what would make it better is if the app synced better with the health app. I have noticed issues in the first couple of days. Wishing that this could be fixed."
5,Crazyluvbug,Absolutely nothing that has tried to asked for money and no ads. Super well built app and helpful for tracking a lot of info. I love this! Already shared online.
5,Laralu$,i recommend this app to folks who struggle to put the word to their feeling big or small and need guidance towards coping sometimes. the free videos are nice to redirect your thoughts. and it tracks your entries so you can see the patterns in yourself. i’ve found it super useful and i told my therapist about it and she said she had a few clients come to mind that might benefit from it! thanks for making this free and accessible!
3,L_justtheletter,"Great interface, as others have mentioned. The videos don’t have subtitles, or whatever UI element I’m supposed to click on to see them is shockingly not obvious. I’m really shocked at this. I can’t use videos without subtitles, this is basic accessibility y’all!"
5,Chelsea6323,I can’t love this app enough. I love the introspection I’ve gained from it. It’s absolutely free. No ads. No gimmicks. Just care and respect. I love the mental health hotline resources. It’s phenomenal. And beautiful.
5,XoChichiXo,This app has helped me in many ways.  I always have trouble expressing my feelings.  This has helped me put a name to what I feel and be able to share it.
4,greengxblin,I absolutely loved this app and used it for so long but didn’t realize my data would erase if I deleted and redownloaded the app to try to fix a glitch. I’m so bummed and now I don’t want to start over.
5,(🤓),"As a digital graphic designer, I can attest that this app is designed to perfection. It is so beautiful and easy to use. Every design decision made reinforces its core concept—accepting our emotions as they are."
5,KalebCra,It’s really helped me and my partner communicate our emotions without having to come searching for help. It’s a good way to really come to terms with our emotions and feelings.
5,NP831,What a wonderful tool.  Easy to use and so helpful.  Helps give a better voice to my feelings and to be able to journal connected to the emotion is great.
5,Opinionator55,I love this app! It has been a fantastic tool for me as I try to understand myself and navigate my emotions. I love the layout and user experience.
5,egb.2,I love this app. The ease of choice makes this very accessible and easy to use no matter what the feeling may be. I love the analytics as well as the helpful videos. Very well done.
5,selfloveclub,"five stars because its like the app actually cares about you. i love being checked up on, and i love the fact that it takes data. knowing that i've been happier lately, somehow makes me even more happy? if that makes sense. this is amazing because theres no ads, and its a non-profit. they don't want anything from you, and it feels safe. its educational, and probably the best self healing app out there right now."
5,caexman,Love the lessons and the options available within this app. I feel like I can save my impressions of my life and each of my days without wasting my time. Love this app!!
3,Dsfrede,"I can see how this can be useful, but it seems like either your Pleasant, Low Energy side needs some choices for those who aren’t feeling bad, per se, but aren’t feeling really good, either (sort of a Meh equivalent but falling on the pleasant side) or you need a neutral section."
5,SD34569483,This app has helped me so much with identifying my feelings and why I’m feeling them and it’s also just my journey of knowing that my feelings are valid
5,ExpatTravel,"This app is so helpful and offers great features and tips for tracking your emotions and what they’re related to. Very easy to use, and quick."
5,LouveniaM,"This app is better then advertised better then average. Informal encouraging ,and helpful. Love all the features and user interface is great . Keep up the great work ."
5,Cbcomeau,"I’ve only been using this app for a couple of days so far, but it’s amazing! The way it helps to narrow down emotions helps to get to the root of my feelings."
5,Hedge funds kill all,I came across this after reading Marc Bracket’s book Permission to Feel. I believe he was involved in this app.  Well constructed and beautiful app which delivers some very nice social emotional learning!
5,markwyner,"This app is really well thought out. My therapist recommended it and I am loving it. It’s not like changing (at least yet, my first week in) but it feels good to be on a path of emotion analysis."
3,CaLyDo,I often find myself looking for additional emotion words that are not included.  The app needs a more comprehensive list of emotions to choose from. I also don’t agree with how some of the emotions are categorized as high vs low energy.
5,E Mitchell,I’ve not loved an app more.   I only wish we could add feelings or submit to get them added. I could use things like”incredulous” or “flat” or “bemused”for instance.
3,KayStarr44,"The only issue I have is it absolutely will not synch my sleep or steps data, despite the permission being allowed.  It only syncs my cycle.  Otherwise, it’s great but could definitely use an option to have more than one emotion at a time."
5,Gotnonickname123,"I never review apps, but this one deserves it. It has so many useful features, and has been such an amazing tool on my self healing - growth journey. It’s a 10/10 for me!"
5,WOGWM,This is such an excellent app. I have been sharing t with clients and using it myself. I’m so well pleased. And for  it to be free due to donars is encouraging and makes me more willing to donate and give money.
5,ClayHarrisNC,"Love the app - wondering if the app could write back check-ins to Apple’s Health Data, if for no other reason than to enable further integrations down the road."
2,Heghirfvnkhkvbmg123,I really enjoyed this app and was keeping track of my emotions and everything and I felt good about it. Then like 30 minutes ago I go to do my daily check in and all my data was erased. After a 92 day streak. All of it. Just poof. It is very disheartening so just keep a heads up about this happening.
5,jlmw1969,"…for anyone like me who needs to monitor their emotions.  Fabulous graphics, incredible lessons, so very useful and easy to record data.  Three thumbs up!"
5,robb.,This app helps me remain mindful of my feelings throughout the day. I find it helps me be more present in my feelings even when I don’t have a scheduled check-in.
5,Jesserton,I love the design and function of this app. It’s amazing and it helps me with how I’m feeling and will improve my quality of life. Thank you for making this app and making it free.
3,snrein1016,"I think an app that’s used to describe emotions, but has limited emotions and no way to add more (please let me be just missing this) is essentially useless. If the emotion I’m feeling is not here, I suppose my option is to use the closest emotion??? Feeling: frustrated, disappointed, and exhausted."
5,Raindhhf,"This is such a great app. It helps me get in touch with my emotions and how I’m feeling. I like how simple it is and easy to use. No ads, payments or anything like that. Definitely recommend!!"
5,rfranc0,The UX is stunning and using it feels effortless and informative. Really looking forward to this small and easy step to better understanding myself.
5,fed up w/ postmates2314525,"I enjoy this app so much, it’s helped me better understand my emotions and reflecting on the in a way I can track them better."
5,lunaelisef,I really like this app but I wish there was a way to add your own emotions to the categories because some of the emotions on there are too simplified
5,humongous muffin,This app is extremely helpful at noticing patterns i emotional stability and I love it so much—I’ve had it for a week and I gotta say it helps :) you should definitely download this!
5,Ahem_middleskin,This app helped me chart my feelings over the course of weeks and recognize some unhealthy patterns. I’m appreciative and recommend for anyone looking to be more mindful on the daily.
5,TerraDogToday,"Does wonders for helping me explore, understand, and keep track of my emotions. Sharing my check-ins with my partner opens up a whole new level of emotional communication!"
5,Whimsy stop smoking,I want you all to know how much I appreciate this app. I’m in the beginning stages of quitting smoking. Smoked for 50 years. I read Marc’s book and loved it and this app is fantastic!
4,Steve739472515,This app is great and I already love it but it would be a lot more useful if it was it was somehow integrated into the Apple Journal app. Like if you could see your HWF mood in the journal app because I like using both.
5,Going-going,"I loved the mood meter before, but this is awesome. I love how it tracks all the data and helps you find themes as well as helping with regulation. Two thumbs up"
5,Sleepy8123,"So for so good only used for a week now. The only thing this far I would change is the four main mood categories: high/low, energy ect."
5,you can calm down,This app is helpful when you can’t seem to calm  down and are trying to find you felling and help feel better to relax and just chill
5,mandymandy2017,The opening of the app with many tiles are my favorite part of this app! It especially helpful for someone who does not have rich expressions on emotions!
5,Melissavzq,Perfect app to keep track of my emotions while being able to capture experiences! Love it
3,Chaz0651,"I enjoy using the app, but it is rather buggy. It won’t let me fill out all the details on my check ins, which limits the apps ability to learn. Kind of defeats the purpose. Once the glitches are fixed then I’d give it a 5/5"
5,*Vibrant€ssence*,This app has been extremely helpful in getting me to check in on my moods during the day.
5,Bella J. R,"i love this app its one of prob my fav on my phone. my only question is i turned on notifications, and i only get like 3 a week. how do i change it to twice a day?"
5,cosmic ghost 9076,I love this app so much but maybe when you put in how long you slept for it could have a minute thing along with the hours
5,SticknKick,The How we feel app is wonderful for getting in touch with emotions and figuring out how to deal and make space for them in our minds.
5,Dtudr,Please allow us to change the time of the check-in in the edit feature! Thank you!
4,SaltedSoju,I really enjoy this app and how it allows me to learn to put words to emotions but it would be nice if there were some neutral emotion options. Sometimes the green and blue emotions are a little too strong for what i'm currently feeling
5,Shockboys,"This app is an instant quality of life improver, seeing patterns in moods and feelings is so helpful and this app helps build community with the people I share with. Love it dearly, use it daily"
5,Adrian Nila 24,I never write reviews but this app has been such an enormous help to me as I’m going through a breakup right now. Thank you Dr. Marc Brackett and to anyone who’s helped on the app.
5,cannonpatriot,I did find this to be an incredibly helpful tool that I didn’t even know I needed it. There’s no reason not to use it give it a try I love it.
5,Akidderz,really love this app. couple weeks of checking in and lessons and i feel like i’m learning about myself and becoming an emotional scientist
5,A Waalkes,Such a great & easy app to track your mental health! Simple & gives you reminders which is so helpful. Can’t wait to see my emotion data!
5,Wendy Day,"Kudos!! You’ve nailed this. Last Spring, I learned I could feed my journals through ChatGPT and get back some incredible analysis.  You have 10x’d that with Reflect. It’s quite amazing."
3,Chellybear921,The only option for passcode is what you already use to unlock your phone. Add an option for a passcode separate from this in case others have your passcode who you don’t want to see your journal entries.
5,Gabyusa4,I love this app!! It helps me recognize and keep track of my feelings. It’s so easy to use and I’m learning to name my feelings and understand them and its patterns.
4,SolooGg,"5 star. Very useful to track own feels and improve self awareness. If there is a Mac version, would be even more convenient to type own feels."
5,CeterraS,I have only been using it for an hour- but it stopped me from having an extreme anxiety attack while on a roadtrip and for that I am so grateful.
5,holymolydshaa,"Check-ins are the best, helps me track my patterns and how to improve them, helps me understand my feelings and try to find balance."
5,H in MD,This app is just what I’ve always needed! Can’t wait to use it and share with my six year old. Thank you!
5,werals,I’ve never seen a better app than this in my entire life
5,goofy stars above,"It is truly an amazing app, like a journal for mental health. It asks you to check in when it’s time, has lessons for every few check-ins, and I’m very impressed."
5,MLpedrick,I use this app every single day! I do my check in’s and it helps me to process my feelings and emotions! It's totally free and that is really good! I just really appreciate this app.
5,SBZee,Such a great idea and execution. Are the data stored with my account or only stored locally on my phone? Hoping to not lose my entries if I switch a phone :)  Amazing work team!
5,cgmiranda,"I’m referring this app and book to so many people! It’s a game changer towards changing our world, because it can help each ofOur unique challenges."
5,Loner1234567890,"I’ve never written an app review, ever, but I had to give praise where this is helping to positively change my way of thinking. 10/10"
4,BlindSight,"When i pick an emotion, i also need to be able to select the intensity   Also, I need to be able to select multiple emotions at one time"
5,Dylanaror,I’m a 13 year old and absolutely love this app not only dose it haze emotions of exactly how your feeling it has videos that give you things to do for those emotions
1,De la creme,"I LOVE this app and have been using it consistently for the past few months, but something about the new update is not compatible with my phone (iPhone 11). It keeps bugging out and freezing. I wonder if anyone else has this issue too? I think it just updated within the last week or so."
5,elijah R.R.,"Thanks for the app! Now I can remember my feelings! Relaxing because of the aesthetic of the app, and Informative because you can learn how feelings work!"
5,ChuckSpirit,This app is honestly probably my new favorite because it helps me understand and cope with my emotions in healthy ways
5,Micnichan33,For somebody who has a hard time not compartmentalizing AND understanding feelings more broad than “happy” “sad” this app is extremely helpful. I am also grateful it is free.
5,rivkamalka,This app is amazing! I just downloaded it and it’s helping me so much! I’m so glad that it’s free to access! You should really create more apps like it!
3,Fuuuchsia42,"I hate the new format.   And please return to the “what are you doing” rather than “what’s making you feel this way”. That’s literally what the note section is for (and says). Or make a fourth part to that section to bring back the what you’re doing part.   Also, the app doesn’t import menstrual data from Apple health, though it imports sleep and weather. Fix or make it possible to manually enter.   Other than that, this is an amazing free app!"
5,jaclynklank,"I love this app so far, it’s really helping me figure out a lot of my mood swings & patterns in my emotions. I really appreciate the creators of this app because they changed my life."
5,Chole A,This app is amazing. It’s simple and easy to use! I recommend this app to anyone who needs to jot down there feelings and get some help with them.
5,RandomNameAssignment,"That this is offered for free impresses me to no end. It is an incredibly helpful tool to help with wellbeing. I’ve paid more for less, and am grateful to the creator and developers."
5,meadow47,Discovered the app thru Timber - great recommendation.  Very interesting opportunity to understand oneself better.  Works beautiful.  I enjoy it and highly recommend it.
4,Hot_guitar,"This app gets better and better.   I wish I could reorder the options under “What are you doing”, and the other two areas."
5,howwefeelapp,Love this app but since the recent update I cannot get it to open. Anyone else ?
5,mfossati2,"Great app to track your emotions, especially anyone interested in learning about themselves and has a respect for emotional intelligence."
2,a-reno,"I like the interface and the data modeling, however, it is in my view, unacceptable for an emotions, tracking app to not contain the emotions of shame and guilt. I also thought it was kind of strange that every emotion is prompted with some type of solution."
5,fernan2393,I normally never write reviews but this app is so great and helpful. Entonce who want to connect better with their feelings should download this.
5,Smile🥰123.,It helps me jot down my feelings and emotions thank you for making this app I’ve been feeling really depressed lately
5,jShow70,"I love the intent and function of this app as well as the usability. Having a simple, guided cue to examine how I’m feeling and provide structure or imagine to my emotions is so helpful. Well done!"
5,Thndrkat,"My therapist recommended this app and it has been super helpful. It’s gentle, affirming, encouraging and instructive. It has really helped me though some hard times."
5,Farabi Azad,I like the app but you should be able to share your notes with friends
3,Miss Pig,"This app can help you be in touch and monitor your feelings and why you are having a particular feeling. The videos are informative, but can only be helpful once any hormonal or chemical imbalance has been addressed/managed."
5,DonSol0,Will change your life. Cannot believe the quality of this app. Developers should be so proud. Masterpiece.
5,Averageuser23,I have been looking for a solid mood tracking application and this one is a stand out success!!
5,surf2ski,Try this app  It’s easy and Has been a great tool to heal stay positive patient and aware of your self Thank you  Care Team!!
5,Coach Lark,"This app is wonderful.  Simple yet easily complex.   The apps ability to help find an emotional word to describe your feeling at the moment is a great help.  I use the app more like an emotional diary.   Any time I feel a different feeling coming on, I notate it in the checkin!  Describe what I was doing and BAM!   Now, with more check ins and time, you’ll be on your way to understanding your emotions and the science behind it!"
5,JerydGG,Well designed and incredibly useful even though I’m only a week into it.
5,nitaaaaaatina,I love this so much! It’s really helping me learn how to feel and process my emotions and feel seen by the people I care about
5,Body sensations,I would add a list of body sensations to choose from then pick a feeling
5,Relic0fficial,This app has helped me get through bad times and help me record my feelings and told me when I needed to therapy. 5 stars
5,L_VA.,"Recently was in-patient, and upon return used this to understand and validate my emotions."
5,TheBeanlet,"I cannot say enough about this app-it’s so helpful and so insightful.  It has really helped me understand my feelings on the whole-Love this app, so thankful that it’s free!"
5,Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn’t think it would be much, but it is a changes lives. It is amazing!!!"
5,amirrrh,One of the apps when start working with you realize you really needed it. Its design is just really so good.
4,Tim Icelu,"I teach DBT -Dialectical Behavior Therapy, of which one of the skills  is  “Emotion Regulation”.   This app is Spectacular in teaching me.  I will recommend it to all my friends and students.   	Tho I can see room for improvement:  Typing just now is most difficult, since the font color is black, barely discernible on the nearly black background.  It would be nice to be able to add written commentary  to the feeling, as well as the spoken.    Thank you!"
5,Kristileeg,"Thanks to this app, I already see patterns in my moods. It is helping me have perspective and also to make needed adjustments in my life. Game changer for me!"
5,M Oliver Adams,It’s by far the highest value app for any mobile device. Wish it had watch support.
5,ArielQ8888,"I was looking for a mood diary, this is the best app. It’s so aesthetic but besides it being aesthetic the functionality of it is amazing. I really love this app and I’m surprised it barley has any reviews."
5,Shannon B #nobswoman,This is a game changer!  Absolutely fantastic app for monitoring your emotions and checking in with friends. I highly recommend.
5,Jb3ar<3,It really helps keeping my emotions in check and makes me feel more organized. I love how it helps me understand what I’m feeling.
3,Wildcat367,Hello I’m writing this review because I am enjoying this app quite a bit. The only downside is it keeps crashing when I click on the tools section. I do hope this helps.
4,ApplesRAwesome,"i love this app and i think it creates an easy platform to track, identify, and work through emotions. i use it daily, but one thing that i think would be helpful is the inclusion of more neutral emotions. i understand that this app challenges you to get better at identifying specific emotions you’re experiencing in the moment, but sometimes an emotion doesn’t teeter into pleasant or unpleasant territory."
3,LightRayB,"The concept of an emotion tracking app is good.    The colors chosen just separate the four quadrants.  They are not related to how our mind reacts to different colors, which differs from person to person, and culture to culture.  I find the tiny black fonts on a splattering of polkadots very difficult to read.   Give me a readable text list to choose from.     Take a look at how Apple is now tracking Moodnotes on the iPhone.     And I thank you for making your app free."
4,Georgiesgirl70,"You could add multiple emotions. We don’t always feel one. Would love to see that update, otherwise it’s a great tool!"
5,iits.elaa,"I love this app, it is helping me so much to understand my emotions and how they feel in my body and mind. And it’s free!!! It’s just amazing, I love it. Download it right now!!!"
5,Gyyvvvb,"it helps me identify what im feeling better, helps me track my emotions everyday, and the videos are very educational!"
3,BrandiBlackman,"I really love this app, and have incorporated it into my daily routine. However, I’m pretty bummed that all my check-in data is lost after the app wouldn’t open for the last 3 days and I had to redownload."
5,Qwergbxgunvffhbcg,I like it a whole lot
2,envoy510,"Something weird just happened and it checked me in after a single touch. It’s the wrong emotion. I can’t change it. Aside from the weird bug, I should be able to change my check in."
5,SpicyCheeto50,Very helpful and great! All though the emotions of the week has the wrong days. Hope this helps
5,UR Worthy,"Love this app bc I can track my moods, the weather, what I am doing and tracks hills and valleys in the week and helps me be intentional in my behavior"
5,lilsgraces,i love this app- it’s super helpful in seeing what affects my mood and how much it changes. i was wondering if you all would ever consider adding a section where we could put what phase of our menstrual cycle we’re on? i’ve always been interested in tracking this and your app seems like the perfect format!
3,mikey! :],An amazing app that helps me a ton. As an autistic person it’s a great tool. I just wish the weather option would work all the time because often it doesn’t work at all.
5,sunshine sundus,It’s a place where i can feel and understand how I feel.
4,Yepey,The pause button doesn’t work within the instructional video sections.
5,Littlebitmads,I want to thank everybody who contributed to making this incredible tool free and accessible! This is such and inspiring use of developing technology for good :)
2,Photo1257,"I’m excited about this app but there must be some bug in the app. When I click on a previous entry, the screen is black. (Blank) I would really like to be able to go back and see previous entries."

5,leoaarongarza,I love this app to track my feelings! The only criticism I have is I wish there was an option for subtitles for the videos!
4,Ty_Anderson987,"Weather can’t be accessed by the app and the workout and sleep times are different from what Apple Health app shows. Other than that, good app."
5,ShareenLinn,So Brenè Brown of you! Thank you!! I needed something like this for so long! Thank goodness my 19 year old told me about it. Very therapeutic.
5,Kerspatchka,The app is seamless to use. The simplicity has made it more inviting for me to continuously use.
5,Pigeon_101,"This app is on point. Thank you so much for creating this. However, I think it could really use a “Regretful” emotion."
1,AGGGHHHH!!!!,"i loved this app and recommended it a lot for helping to identify emotions, but the newest update is so terrible it’s unusable to me. the UI changes, specifically the switch to multiple entry screens, are redundant and nauseating. now it feels like posting a status update instead of an intimate journal entry. extremely disappointing"
5,jeawy,This a great app to check-in on self! Makes getting in touch with emotions daily very easy. Nice visual and audio diary; it’s a simple self- care tool.
5,Mandio25025,This app is really helping me track my emotions which leads me to greater understanding about myself. I am thankful I found this app.
5,AoEsad,"Here I am, 28 year old man who apparently knows nothing about his emotions 😂 I’m loving this app, and I’m loving learning about emotional intelligence."
5,Kenzasaurus Rex,"I can’t emphasize enough how valuable this app is. No purchase required, no ads. Funded by donations to make emotional intelligence accessible."
4,Siniktmak,I like this App very much but I think it needs to add some more words like slugging. I will add more words when I find them. Thank you very much
5,Adam_Edward,I can't think of a better app honestly. It's made exactly perfectly and I highly recommend!
4,The Ghost of Cronus,"It’s great to see socially conscious tech that is not trying to bleed users out, selling them magic bullets with which to slay their demons.  One suggestion: iPad App, Mac App, Watch App…  Let’s get this into the ecosystem."
5,RoadaRolla,See title. I just wanna use it on my watch 😭
5,Driving 2417,This app is helping me become more in control of my emotions and self aware. Very happy to have found this.
3,Joy_1024,"I love this app so much, and I suggested it to my partner. However, he is colorblind and it is very hard for him to read the emotions on the red shapes. I looked, but I could not find any accessibility options"
5,Jacon Howell,Thank you for making this app. It’s helped more than you could imagine.
5,djdhhdhrbr,Best therapy app out of all the ones on the AppStore… this app isn’t always asking you to go premium or anything like that
5,DudeWritingRevue,Crashes every time I go to tools.
5,AyeRayptor,I want to kill my self and this app allows me to track how I feel about that.  Cool I guess.
5,Athoubalbusaily,Great app! Helped me understand the spectrum of my emotions. It would be nice to have a choice to login the current period phase
5,AlexuChann,Please make a widget! Would love quick access especially when stressed/busy!
3,ccarebear651,"I like the app, but it’s missing the fringe feelings, I need more like meh! Most of the time I’m between low energy and high energy energy but there’s no option for that. Period"
5,objective list theory,"Grazi Mille! This app just works for me. From the colors to the videos, I feel more connected to myself emotionally. Cheers to everyone who worked on it!"

5,😃🥰👌👍🙂,"Ok so I’ve had this app only for a day and it is really helping! But I don’t have a social media app so, ya you get the point but over all, good app!"
5,kaaaallleeeyyy,Make a widget for easier updating —- Just started crashing when adding exercise.
5,gdjixibc,"I love this app, it helps me know what I’m feeling and it’s a great reminder to check in on yourself! Definitely recommend."
5,Quinten Oppong,Great App! And as a Therapist I love the tools app and reflection app. Would love to see it be more welcoming to people of faith in the reflection when we talk about prayer and meditation.
5,泽西城一枝花,"EQ is important. This app provided scientific based practices with lovely UIs, and free to use. I already feel my life will be changed by it positively."
5,Mianenena,Absolutely fantastic! I enjoy the ease to record my emotions. The videos and tools are extremely helpful. Thanks

4,slotha are awsome stella,I think that this is a great app we just need to be able to pick more than one emotion because no one ever just feels one emotion.
5,Ahtrahddis Raklamrah,Perfect for building emotional vocabulary and establishing a deeper connection with yourself.
5,Holdenthedoor32,"Cool to look back and see how you were feeling that day, but I don’t care for the videos about ferlings"

5,Fluff7fluff717,Love this app. It would be nice to have more emotions and possibly give the option to have custom emotions.

5,TheFlungLoin,I’m a therapist and I love the definitions paired with the emotions- it helps me accurately report! Easy to use and room to personalize with detail:)
1,Isaac P. 2015,"While I initially enjoyed using this app as a simple, straightforward mood tracker, I am immensely disappointed to see the developers buy in to and introduce LLM features. While optional, I can mot trust developers who incorporate such technology, especially in relation to mental health. I am very disappointed."
5,Yusif Khalilov,Thanks for great app. Can you add export button so we can export our emotions data as a json or csv file please?
5,milosmiilo,Me and my friends use this app together and it helps us stay connected.
3,Gabriel is,"Often I feel combinations of emotions and can only choose one.  When sharing you have to choose to send a single emotion, rather than being able to passively share the whole history which would be preferable  The descriptions of emotions is helpful.  The suggestions after logging are quite helpful and brief.  The aggregate and over time info could be better"
5,githona26,I am a product designer and I have to say this is my favorite app this year so far. Outstanding 💕
4,Smart_dumb_blonde,Love this app so much but it’s very frustrating when information I input disappears
3,anon7899,App just goes to black screen when selecting emotion from a search. Restarting sometimes helps. It’s enough to make it not worth the trouble
5,imizteach25,I am really being made aware of how I am feeling and why I am feeling the way I am with this app.
5,Tushall Sharma,Simply stunning design and UI. Love using it with friends to track daily mood and feelings.

5,Mimi2830,My favorite app! I really like the quality of writing down my thoughts and feelings every day. 😌
5,JohnnyCorpOriginal,"This is truly amazing journaling app, AI reflection and emotion tracking combined is the what makes it perfect"
4,Rich 1 Poor 1,I’m not fully aware as to how to use the app to track my moods. I’m not using it to its full advantage.
5,iKlover,Life is crazy and we all need a little guidance. This helped my girlfriend and her son and I’m praying it helps me along with a good Lord amen.

3,jimjackdude,"Tried this because wife and daughters were doing it. Nothing earth shaking or especially insightful so far. Recycled happy talk psycho jargon.  I am 88, retired, healthy with no bucket list left. I can’t summon up much stress."
5,KodLikeTheFisj,"This app has no ads, is easy to use and its intentions are amazing. With someone with bipolar disorder this app really helps with dbt!"

4,basset_hound_lover,this app is so awesome! it has helped me come to terms with my feelings and acknowledge them. the only thing i wish was different is that you can only use the friend feature with an apple id. one of my close friends apple id doesn’t work and we can’t be friends on the app! otherwise this app is perfect!
5,Chanman81897,I’m a therapist and I recommend it to all of my clients!!!!! HelpReally helps that it is free to use and not a subscription.
5,TraceyLe,Most people cannot name ten emotions this is a fantastic way of building your emotional vocabulary I love this app ❤️

4,jfiwmsmbfid,I like the idea of this app… I knocked off a star because it’s not letting me write or record what I’m doing with each feeling…
5,Lu Stangherlin,A gift for all of us. How lucky I m to find this app.  Everybody should use it!!
5,okcorral-carl,"I use this app, my clients use this-it’s fantastic! Backed by solid science, elegant UI, variety of practices, and it’s free. Thank you!!!! 💚"
5,kadieelaine,"i’ve tried them all…i’ve deleted them all…i’ve redownloaded and tried again…but in the end none of the emotional wellness tracking apps have met my needs. the majority of them require subscriptions or in app purchases to unlock full content which is really frustrating and disappointing. how we feel was recommended to me by my therapist as i was leaving therapy one day. i forgot about it until i saw the sticky note with “how we feel” scribbled onto it. i checked it out on the app store and downloaded it. at this point i wasn’t too sure that i would like it and based on my past experiences i assumed i would end up deleting it shortly after. after a minute of tinkering around with the app, i knew i had something special in my hands. i’m not great at naming emotions, like at all. but this app has done so much for me. i have learned more emotions and with the short descriptions the app offers i have been able to easily pick out what i’m feeling. i tend to feel like a million different emotions throughout the day which is so frustrating but this app allows me to check in with all those different feelings whenever i want or when it notifies me too. i love all of the data it collects and compiles for you. this app is changing my life. i have become the biggest spokesperson for how we feel in my community of people i love. i literally share it with everyone with so much excitement and enthusiasm. i have been in therapy forever now and even though i feel as if i know all the strategies and coping techniques, the videos on this app always pleasantly surprise me with new insights! i can’t recommend this app enough. thank you how we feel!"
5,g it do hi it cv,"Beautiful design, the art makes me happy"
5,Mangoeslaaa,It allows me to just be an observer of my own body. No judgment. Just seeing and hearing how it feels.
5,CosmicReviews,"I actually heard about this app from a review left on a separate app I had tried and deleted because most, if not 90% of the features were pay to use. I’ve tried a lot of mental health apps over the years but usually give up on a lot of them because of how many in app purchases they try shoving down your throat, all with the hefty promise of “curing your depression”… This is the real deal though. No. It may not CURE your depression, but as someone who has found journaling to be one of the best ways to manage my mental health over the years, How We Feel has made navigating my everyday thoughts and emotions so much easier. Especially because sometimes I don’t understand what emotion I’m feeling until I look over their large wall of emotions and can get incredibly specific on just what my brain is experiencing. I also tried listening and watching and participating in several of the activities that come free with the app and some of them just amazed me with the uniqueness. For example- “creating a negative story” and then watching it burn and letting it go. Or choosing a few photos that I like looking at and captioning them to create what’s essentially an easily accessible slideshow of my favorite life moments. I enjoyed those two in particular. I’d love to see even more activities in the future as well but even as the app stands now, I can confidently say anyone searching for a mental health journaling app or just mental health tracking app in general should give it a try."
1,8rZX7,"I can download and open this app on my first generation iPhone SE. But I can’t get past the “Find words to identify your emotions” page.   It works fine, however, on my 15 Pro and 13 mini. But sometimes I have my old SE and want to log how I feel."
5,Albert Fingernoodle,My therapist recommended this to me and it’s actually effective. It helps me express my feelings.
5,Awesome sauce 125747483,This app is so great and I love it so much and it’s so helpful and I’m also 13s that really has a lot.
5,Gert’s Journey,LOVE this app! What a great way to chronicle one’s emotional wellbeing and journey with insightful lessons on how to manage your emotions. Thanks🙌🏻
5,Jonas_ish,"Since emotions color the canvas of human experience, understanding emotions is a vital life skill.   This app teaches that skill in a very neat, clean, succinct manner."
5,LisaPsyched,Very creative tracking system with lovely videos.
5,fratimly,Thank you so much for creating such a awesome and powerful tool realization in your self feels good
4,FBAUM,This app is great because its snappy/easy to use system keeps me coming back!  But…  The opening animation defeats the quick vibes and also stops any music playing on your phone and that is incredibly annoying.   Such an easy fix! Please do not interfere with music playback!!!!
5,AJ27777,Amazing app! We need the Apple Watch App to enter our mood more easily.
5,Unhappy :'(,"Get the app, it’s so helpful. Thank you to the creators."
5,bhuze,"Great descriptions of emotions, an ai tool to help resource and find ways to regulate. Love this for myself and my clients"

5,1119Bixler,This app has helped be better identify my emotions and organize them
4,Bobbyblarfo,"app is great, but is there a way you can add an “access all contacts” option so that we can see what friends we already have that are on the app? it’s kind of hard trying to ask around to see who has the app and then type in people’s codes manually. thaaaanks!"
5,AlrcemieSwirls,It’s really helped me see and break down what I’ve been feeling.
5,Lovemj4life,The app is outstanding in every way. I am particularly impressed by the breathing exercises.
5,Shugababaay,Love this app .. I’m infatuated .. I use it daily & already have 3 friends that have joined w me
5,LunaTheCat321,This is one of the best apps I’ve literally ever had. It is so helpful and I HIGHLY recommend it🥰🥰🫶
5,Duckdodger01,Best app for doing an emotional check-in and great tools for regulation
5,4d Nathalie,"it’s so calming just to use it :) i love the colors and the analyze tab :))) one problem: when i click on the red button to show only high energy unpleasant in the analyze tab, for some reason “mellow” is also included"
5,Just Saying - My Opinion,Has added to my insight and self reflection
5,Sarah’s Reviews,It’s a helpful app for a daily routine. Especially for people who have struggled with mental health. I am truly thankful…
1,Chef Boyardé,"I’m running this app with the latest iOS. Videos freeze or simply don’t play at all. I’ve written to customer support, but get no reply. So, it’s a flawed app with no support. Couldn’t be worse for anyone struggling with mental health issues. Sad."
5,dddogdodha,"when i try to make an entry, such as a picture or custom response, the screen goes black and doesn’t let me add anything else, just have to save then move on. stays black when i try to edit it"
5,dhuscnkc,Thank you!
4,EricAlexanderMedicine,Needs some small tweaks before becoming best app hand down 3 thumbs up.
5,cardboard18857,I love being able to describe my emotions and gather them in one place very cool
5,Lia0321!,A great well thought out app that provides resources. And is truly free.
1,Zeke_2099,I have this app on my samsung tablet and it works just fine but for some reason on my iphone its not functional. There’s also no way to reach out to the developers to tell them 🤷🏾
5,brother odell,This feelings app is by far one of the best tools I found through brother Colton
5,andrea111🌙,This app is entirely free & provides so much comfort & insight on emotional well-being. Thank you🤍
3,Jful2,I love the idea of this!! But it keeps crashing when I try to open it
3,Tomsixtyate,"I’ve loved using the app so far, but I feel the exclusion of the emotion “horny” has been detrimental in sharing my emotions with my friends."
5,Kita075,"Love the app and I recommend it to my friends and family. The user experience is lovely and the interface is beautiful and simple to use. Logging an emotion is easy and I can log as many as I want throughout the day. I also love that I can attach a note, picture or voice memo to my emotion and go back and look at it later. It gives you an overview on the calendar of your emotions and i love the unique shapes for each emotion. Also the hepatics for the emotion selection screen as you scroll and how they change from a circle to the unique shape and color is beautiful. I like how the emotions are organized by energy levels and pleasantness as well as color. Very visually pleasing. App makes it so you barely have to actually think about how you’re actually feeling it rather guides you to help you figure out how you’re feeling if that makes sense and not only is there a broad spectrum of words but it gives descriptions for the words. Wow. Most emotion tracking apps use a variation of smiley faces but this is way way more in depth and is increasing my emotional self awareness with new vocabulary words. I feel like I can actually chart and describe how I feel instead of just a frowny face button. It gets the juices flowing. Usually I journal but you just can’t beat the way this system is organized. Only thing I’m not completely fond of is the prompts to watch the videos immediately following my check in. Id love to see them on the dashboard or in a place that feels more optional but I feel pushed to click on a video that I may either not have time for or not be interested in. The way it’s presented feels forced but I am glad they are there and may revisit some of the topics in the future. I like how the recommendations pertain to the last emotion logged however usually after I log how I felt I want to immediately go to the dashboard so I can see how everything’s been trending or I want to see my calendar, not watch a video. Amazing app I really do love it."
5,Sky633,What a beautiful app. I’m starting to notice a change  and an impact. Love the exercises.
4,Dogo68681,This is a really good app for self aware people or people just trying to keep in touch with there emotions
5,"Mr,BlueSky",Works as advertised Not driven by profit Well designed
3,犬の年,"I don’t like the new update, it turned off my weather sync & Face ID verification. I never use the “Journal” part & now it’s shoved in my face."
5,Bellabake26,It is a great app if your struggling with finding how you feel.
5,teeheehee98,I’m able to vent to my self… I noticed my patterns & triggers!!! Please get the app!!
5,RJalapeño,I love the Go Deeper AI during the check in and summary with suggested affirmations.
5,ce /ce,And others
5,Immma stay woke,This is such a kind app to create.
4,rellteell,"I love this app, the only thing that would keep it on my phone is if there was a widget."
5,jerdenlevy,The best emotion tracker I’ve used. And it’s free! The most deserving of 5 stars of any app I’ve seen
2,Youravg_reviewer,This is a really helpful app but it needs an update. I try to put in the details for an emotion but everything keeps either bugging out or crashing.
5,Nike shea,Makes me feel better
3,Wilderness Surrounds Him,Would be great if they would add a Home Screen widget so you could see at a glance how your friends are feeling
1,AONSW,"I really love this app, I’m a therapist and use it myself, with my kids, and clients. It’s neurodivergent friendly, and really appreciate  starting with  “energy”. I would love if there was a way to choose more than one feeling at a time."
5,Katrina987654,Appreciate the plethora of emotions to choose from and how they help me define how I’m feeling.
5,"li,m",I love this app haven’t seen it but used it a little
5,Lauren ROX UR SOX,This app is amazing
5,Jatinpatel1489,So far the best app for your mental health and wellbeing
4,Mickey Nagel,This app has definitely helped me deal with some major areas that I need to work on and given me some great ideas on how to change my outlook problem areas. I have found that I get in very dark moods sometimes and they get out of control but I’ve been doing some of the suggestions on how to just allow myself to feel and not to think that they are either something really bad and that I shouldn’t feel that way but to go ahead and feel what I’m feeling because it won’t last forever. I have a mood disorder too which can cause my emotions to spin out of control sometimes but since I’ve been using this app I have been able to realize that my emotions are ok to have but I need to be careful not to let them take over. It’s been good for me to slow myself to feel my happiness it my anger out my sadness and I’m learning that they are ok to feel and that they do eventually change as time goes by. Nothing last forever and I’m learning. So that hopefully you guys can fix and that is when I go to add that makes me feel good about myself. There is a slight problem that hopefully you guys can fix. When I go to add my new emotions after I enter my emotions on top of the original emotion the screen goes blank or if your journal it goes blank and you can’t do anything else but save it and go on when you go on to the next time to check your entire. It doesn’t give you the option to go in and fix that or amend that emotion at all. I would love to get more in depth with that and how to cope know better when to stop before my Enrons possibly get out of control. You guys have such great ways of telling us that we’re not wrong for having feelings and that it’s ok. Thank you for bringing me such insight to myself.
4,Miss_CCH,"I love this app, although I do wish it had widgets to make it easier to input moods."
2,nibbuls,"The app should write the check-ins into Apple Health, so we can see them across apps. Until then I’m forced to use Apple Health’s much worse input."
5,hadlee :),We would LOVEEEEE if you guys added comments!!
3,Fopples,"i really want to use this app because i like its features, but its so buggy every time i use it, and now it literally restarted my phone, i dont know if its because i have an older phone (iphone 11 pro) but man ive never had an app this buggy ever"
5,Leezrti,"Excited to find this app.  Helpful, works well and it’s free!"
5,giovanna.07,i love this app so much!! it had helped me track my emotions and be mindful about how i’m feeling and think about it on a deeper level and for how emotional i can be it had really helped🤭highly recommend
5,Goofffu,This is one of the best apps to journal your emotional journey anddds your life.  I’m really grateful for this. It’s simply the bestttttt…
5,Nicest2024,I’m surprised I never expected this app to be so positively effective
5,Nonyie,I can express how I feel privately.
5,Chrissy 13073,This is a great app! I recommend to others.
5,BayleighP,"I’m in a masters in counseling program and one of my friends/classmates shared this app with me. I am in LOVE!! I’ve always considered myself pretty in touch with my feelings but this app really helped me learn how to label my feelings effectively and learn about feelings in general in such a fun, easy, and aesthetically pleasing way. It features great therapeutic exercises that are helpful when I need to calm down or am caught up in negative thoughts (I can’t remember if they’re research based but they do help for sure). I’m going to recommend this to my clients for sure!! Also, just for context, I am NOTORIOUS for downloading a mood tracking app, doing it for two days, then getting bored with it. That definitely didn’t happen with this one!! I don’t do it every day, but I DO do it whenever I’m having a particularly strong feeling. It’s helpful for me to use to track my symptoms (depression and anxiety), especially considering I just started a new dosage of medication and need to monitor myself even more closely!! This app helps me remember how many depressive/anxious episodes I’ve had and what I’ve been feeling so I can work on them in therapy and have something helpful to report to my psychiatrist. It’s just such a great tool and it’s all of this FOR FREE!!! As a future therapist, I cannot endorse this app enough. I’m usually too lazy to write reviews, but I feel like this is such a useful app that everyone should have on their phones, even if they only use it once in a while."
5,jmeBEE,We love this app! Great communication tool for building foundation with open communication and understanding emotional intelligence
5,vllyra,"Beautiful, simple, effective. It’s so easy to use!"
4,loveanddeath,"I get that this is a 4+ age rating, and I appreciate that, as I’d love to have my kids try this as they get older too, BUT, I’d also love to see some more adult range of emotional options. In some ways it’s interesting to try to categorize amorous feelings under the existing options (eager, excited, loved…) but occasionally I’d like to be a bit more blunt about what’s really going on there. Maybe giving us a custom option and letting us categorize a free-form field into one of the color categories would satisfy both the need to keep it PG, with the need to recognize that adults feel adult emotions. Plus it’d be useful for any time the existing feeling words don’t quite capture your feelings, and the app could still suggest strategies based on the color category. I’d also appreciate more apple health integration. For example, do I feel less “unpleasant” feelings when I’ve had more water to drink? or adding more complexity to the menstrual cycle integration (like, mood breakdown on cycle day 1-5, 6-10…). Seeing how sleep quality impacts mood, not necessarily just number of hours. These are all things that apple health can register, and I think it would be a fascinating learning experience to see which things in your life effect the way you feel, and depending on which of them are in your control, to do things that will help you feel the way you want to feel more often. For menstrual cycle, sometimes just knowing that “these few days of my cycle I usually feel a little low” can help remind us that this too shall pass, and there’s probably a reason for it that’s beyond your control.   Anyway, love the app, just would love a little more."
5,GabsDabs97,"This app has REALLY helped me identify emotions, which I’m not generally good at."
4,Nessi505,It’s a wonderful app. It’d be perfect if it also connected to Garmin and Apple Health!
3,Acomm71809,"i wish it was possible to tag multiple emotions per check in. i rarely feel just one thing at a time, since human emotions are usually more nuanced than that so i’m very surprised an app like this doesn’t allow for more complexity"
5,revanthesith,Straight to the point and very helpful
2,sunshineangell,When I try to use the app it tries to open but then disappears from the screen.
5,Tnewhouse,"Quick, easy, self explanatory!"

1,Iz Zy instagram:guineapig9651,Very nice app but the new updates for it makes it crash
5,ramsay1two,"Alright yeah. I like writing but CANNOT consistently journal. I didn't really understand why. I'd get the urge to write a full-blown autobiography like once a year. I'd redownload the journal apps I had tried in the past or repurpose my notes app and go ham. This would last two days. MAYBE a week. My drive to journal would vanish just as it would reappear.  I don't know what I want in a journal. I do know that I like to jot down notes on my day or my thoughts on life every now & then but I had no clue why I couldn't keep it up after the novelty wore off. Surely, journal entries aren't always interesting or filled to the brim with quotes and meaning. Surely they can't always clear my mind or feel therapeutic. Well.. after *actually* using this app for over a month now (a new record for me by a long shot).. I don't think journaling *has* to be anything. And THAT is why I think I've wound up sticking with this app longer than any journal/diary app I've tried. Let me explain..  Other apps might make you believe journaling is this stoic journey--something that can eliminate the stress in your life or be some transformative experience that turns you into the best version of yourself. The focus is on the *journaling* itself.. and that makes sense considering that's the whole idea of a journaling app. But.. that is also why I would quit using them.  I like the idea of journaling. All the benefits it can provide. I like making my entries look nice, coherent, and pleasing to look at. I like the idea of adding pictures, playlists, or locations to an entry to provide context for its inspiration. But, after a while, you it becomes mundane. You get annoyed when you get your ""entry reminder"" or ""prompt"" at the end of the day because you don't want to go through the effort of making a nice journal entry that day. Nothing happened or you're just too tired to give it any thought. You're too upset. Or too bored. Or you don't like their prompt. Whatever it is.. you just stop journaling at some point.   Well. How We Feel is different. The focus isn't on the journal. It's on your feelings. Something you can almost always describe. The app doesn't ask you how felt during your afternoon walk or the hour you were listening to a playlist while running errands. It doesn't surprise you with a specific prompt that might be too difficult to address in that moment. There's no sidebar showcasing all the formatting features or the pictures you took exactly one year ago today. There's NO pressure at all. Just pick a feeling and jot something down if you like.  I don't feel like I have to make my notes look pretty or keep up a ""streak."" I can write exactly how I feel with literally no friction--or just forget about the app altogether that day.   The beauty of journaling doesn't come from a clever entry title, color coordinated images, or even an action-packed day. It comes from just doing it--with or without effort. Being able to look back on a month's worth of entries and seeing all the emotions you felt helps put things into perspective. It's cathartic just to write it all down with no pressure to write perfectly or go back and read everything you've written. That's where this app shines and is the only journal-oriented app that I've stuck with longer than a month. It's easy. Frictionless. And optional.  There's no hidden fees. You are a ""premium"" user right out of the gate. You aren't bombarded with features or the pressure do start bettering yourself right away. You just pick an emotion. Write if you want to. Done. You can peruse the mental health resources within the UI if you want & they actually feel genuine and helpful.   Like I'm actually looking for some red flag in this app that jumpstarts my cynicism and plants that seed of doubt. I can't find it. It's totally free. It doesn't seem to sell my data anywhere. I don't feel pressured into doing anything--not even the pressure I normally put on myself in order to stick with journaling or make my entries stand out. The resources within the app have actually been helpful and genuine. The entire experience has been.. uniquely wholesome.   I'm deciding to write this review not because the app asked me to (I don't think it has) but because I was able to look back on a month of journal entries and reflect. It's a cool experience!   Thank you to whoever makes this app possible <3"
1,SanvelloShits,This really doesn’t help at all just shines a light on all the things in your life that generate anxiety and depression
3,gldnoreos,please add a backup or export option! i had lost so many of my entries already but i still want to keep using this app.
1,Miracledavis,The app will no longer open for me.
5,FreeTree2009,"Very good app, but please localize into Russian"
5,Dustinfghtf,"I was looking for an app to use as a digital journal when I found and downloaded this a year or so ago. At the time I didn’t want to be a middle aged blue collar man with a hardcover diary. I thought the idea of tagging moods and emotions to the entries sounded novel too, so I gave it a go. What I realize now is that finding these words to describe how we feel changed my entire life. The power is in naming the emotions very specifically, with precise words, altered my life for the better.   Once I learned how to communicate how I feel, I was able to recognize where I had let people cross personal boundaries, where I had unrealistic expectations and made assumptions, I learned how to self reflect and regulate my emotions. I started to recognize personal traits in myself that I did not like, and felt better equipped to shed my own toxic traits.  The analyze function just gets better the longer you use the app. You can add various bits of info at your check-ins. Maybe you didn’t realize that time with your sibling generally makes you agitated. Maybe you’re not recognizing that you’re always sad in your car. More importantly, maybe you learn the WHY and can work toward fixing it.   There’s also a video series with various healthy coping tactics like breathing exercises, reflections, guided meditations, etc. I found some of them helpful, but the words and definitions were the highlight.   Just give it a try. Set up notifications for reminders to check in at times you’re not typically busy (I do 4x a day). I can’t write down all the good things it’s set in motion for me.  *Developer suggestion: Take us back to the big board of emotions layout when we want to add a second feeling, The current  scroll list/categorized UI is less enjoyable to use and just feels out of place. Also, sometimes I want to use a third feeling. I don’t think it should be a feature for newer users though- the specificity was the key for me early on."
1,Lumen777,1 screen sits frozen.  Nothing happens when an emotion is pressed. 0 settings or help.  My feeling now? Frustrated.

5,PhillipW User,"Coming from someone who didn’t understand my own emotions and struggled as I navigated personal challenges in life, this has been instrumental in maximizing my personal development, therapy and mindfulness in my daily life.   So many feelings and emotions that I never tried to understand and finally realizing how it would manifest itself in all areas of work, marriage and family life. This is arguably the best FREE APP on the App Store and I think one of the most generous and important tools available. I love everything about it and realize how important its service is to others.   I’m grateful for the people who spent time and money to develop this, the approach is SO SIMPLE, and remove complicated barriers like their counterparts. They have brilliantly approached a self-logging style that is educations and intuitive that doesn’t require much effort than 5 seconds. I don’t feel exhausted reporting my progress like other apps that I have since left in favor of this one.   The exposure to different emotions and there definitions have been one of the most eye opening revelations for me. Understanding the meaning of words used to label emotions have a large impact on understanding how to navigate and combat its affect, something that I am slowly realizing as I better understand what means to be mindful and an emotional scientist.   Bravo team, this app is entirely fantastic and I hope you continue to make it free since there are so many of us that need this to help navigate our inner voice and thoughts while living in a noisy and distracted world.  Thank you again!"
4,azzythehufflepuff,i love that im learning more about my emotions but i wish the videos had an option to add subtitles.
4,zomnker,Not really a review but a suggestion. The new 988 should be in the mental health hotlines.

5,Jlbryan2,Love love love this app! Thank you!
5,mr_chowdhary,"I’ve been using this for a long time now with many check ins over time.   ""How We Feel"" is a remarkable app that truly revolutionizes the way we understand and navigate our emotions. The importance of emotional intelligence (EQ) cannot be overstated, and this app is a game-changer in fostering self-awareness.  I simply love the app's user-friendly interface and insightful prompts make it easy to track and reflect on your emotions. The daily check-ins have become an integral part of my routine, helping me gain a deeper understanding of my emotional landscape.  One suggestion would be to fully utilize Apple's ecosystem by introducing HWF widgets for the Lock Screen, Home Screen, and StandBy feature on iOS. This would allow for seamless access and quick emotional check-ins, giving us a constant and almost instant reminder to stay in touch with their feelings when we feel them.   Furthermore, a deeper integration with Apple Health and the deeper integration to the dedicated Mental Well-Being category within it would be a fantastic addition as well. This could open up new avenues for incorporating emotional awareness into our daily lives, potentially revolutionizing the way we approach mental health.  Overall, ""How We Feel"" is a must-have app for anyone looking to enhance their emotional intelligence and well-being. HWF is well deserving of all the awards and recognition it has received. I’m excited to see how the developers continue to refine and expand this invaluable tool. Kudos to the team behind this incredible app! 💐✨"
4,ksmallz13,"I really like how this app helps me pinpoint how I'm feeling by providing brief descriptions of the feelings. I can struggle sometimes to figure out why or how I'm feeling bad aside from just ""I feel bad."" The variety of feelings and their brief descriptions are really helpful for figuring out how I feel and steps I can take to address that, if needed. I also like that I can link it with health app data, I can leave myself a little journal entry/not, and there are a variety of tags I can select for each check-in.  However, I have a few points of critique/suggestion: 1) I really wish users could add a few additional emotions, even just five, and customize/change the name of some emotions. There are a few things I feel and describe in ways that don't fit into any of the provided emotions. I also may feel things a certain way but call it differently, which can make it hard to find and log. For example, ""Cancelled"" is an emotion I would change the name of, and ""buzzy"" is an emotion I would add.  2) I also wish there was an additional tag section where physical symptoms can be tracked, or else a section that users can completely customize. I like that there are sections for what you're doing, who you're with, and where you're at, but one more section, possibly for physical sensations or else completely customizable, may be helpful for many users. That way if I feel a certain sensation, I can select that tag to help me identify what I may be feeling based on what I've felt in the past.  3) I wish tags could be reorganized by the user, or else automatically sorted alphabetically. I sometimes feel like it's a bit of a word-hunt to find the tag I'm looking for, esp if I have a lot under a section.  All of the above being said, so far this app has been incredibly useful for me, and the variety of emotions I can select from are significantly more useful than the 1-5 style ratings that many other apps include. It also doesn't feel overwhelming or like too many steps to use, making check-ins easy, quick, and something I will probably continue using after that first 1-2 weeks of newness wear off for me.  I look forward to continuing to use this app and seeing how the developers and designers continue to improve it. Lastly, and perhaps most of all, thank you that it's free! Even if the above items I critiqued are never addressed, this app is absolutely worth downloading and is extremely useful, and I hope it remains free and accessible to all users."
5,incarminis,"I don't often write reviews for apps, if ever; however, this one and Opal have really changed my life for the better.   Although it's only been a few days since I began using How We Feel, I'm actually alarmed—in a good way—by how much my emotions change, how many unique emotions I feel, and the IDENTITIES of the emotions I feel in general. My whole life I feel like I've logically known what emotions are but struggled to name them, aside from really strong ones like anger or anxiety. I mainly just feel, ""This is nice, I guess,"" and ""Oh, God, make it stop."" HWF having names and definitions and shapes mean I can actually pinpoint what I feel for once, and I'm 22... The matter of how I've survived this long without a meaningful dictionary of emotions completely mystifies me, frankly. All I know is that I feel like a totally different person now that my identifiable emotion spectrum has become a lot more complex.  I recently read a book called How Emotions Are Made (it's a very good book, by the way) and one of the main things that the author recommends to increase self-awareness and expand your emotional consciousness/intelligence is to just get better at recognizing your emotions. No need to ""get rid of them"", right? Well, I'm a perfectionist and I always feel like I make it my job to find answers.   I find that using How We Feel stops me from doing any redundant exploratory work. HWF's labeling (high/low energy + pleasant/unpleasant) is also INCREDIBLY intuitive and great at subverting the connotations of ""negative and positive"" or ""good and bad"" emotions. They're just emotions.   Overall, awesome app. I love the interface and it's very user-friendly. I hope to continue to use this and I'm so thankful that I'm not bombarded with ads and microtransactions. The transitions and visual aspects are also so pleasant to interact with."
5,cckerns,"I like how I can take quick snapshots of my life and put them here for review later. Snap a photo of what I’m doing, voice record how I’m feeling, and pick an emotion. This setup makes exploring emotions I didn’t know I experienced because I’d cover them with the blanket of “fear” or “anxiety” or “stressed” or “overwhelm.” This app helped me realize that a lot of times what I thought were those was actually pressure, which is this feeling that the outcome rides on me.   Learning this about myself enabled me to decide if I needed ALL of the pressures (internal and external) attached to those outcomes. Journaling with the app (and classic pen and paper) helped me realize the timeline I set for outcomes are almost always way out of sync. I’ve always been told that, but having my own data that I collected (not people just telling me “You put too much on your plate) was really helpful and made me want to try reducing my objectives and building longer timelines.   All this to say, I like that the app provides just a little space between me and my internalizations of other people’s expectations, enough options to deconstruct those internalizations.  This app is not therapy nor would I say for me is it enough. I also use Headspace and real therapy with a licensed therapist. I would say maybe this app serves as a great fast-acting glue to bridge the benefits of those other services into a more cohesive program I’ve been developing for myself.   We’re all little walking experiments of humanity.  Good luck to everyone on their journey for self-discovery."
3,hammmmmmmmmondffffffffd,Its a good app
4,internate3000,love the app — it’s beautiful — but really needs and export feature.
5,HAmanda83,"To say thank you, just does not describe the depth of my gratitude. I suffer from CPTSD and also emotion regulation. I would not go as far to say as BPD, but I have been diagnosed with that. I am constantly looking for ways to navigate my biology neurobiology physiology mentality awareness of feelings, and all are somehow connected to the desire to best regulate my emotions. I have only been using this app for two days and I can already see how this is going to improve my state of mind.  The constructive criticism that I might add… first I would thank the “autistic” person who wrote the review, stating that there is a need for more moods/emotions that are not listed or being able to cluster these moods in one check-in -at least, this is what I understood from their review-  The thing that I would add, is a need in the menstrual cycle section; instead of no flow, light flow, heavy flow, etc. I truly believe it needs to go a little deeper, starting with the day 0 at which the menstrual cycle begins. My moods and emotions very much rely on hormones. I would very much like to understand myself better during these phases there is some research on PubMed, one of many articles:  The role of emotion regulation in the experience of menstrual symptoms and perceived control over anxiety-related events across the menstrual cycle This was a copy and paste; I apologize for the varying size and font in text. Follicular Phase  Ovulation Phase  Luteal Phase   Anyhow, I really appreciate what you guys at Yale are doing and I am glad to be a participant in your research.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you Professor, Andrew Huberman for suggesting the app."
3,s C frdftddhhffchu,It’s good but it is not giving me subtitles anymore
4,Emawsh,"I really enjoy how this app forces me to pinpoint EXACTLY how I feel and am very grateful for the definitions. Even as a pretty literate person, it can be hard to differentiate some of these so those are helpful. Enjoy the general process of selecting moods, especially the part where you select energy/pleasantness and then get the larger set. I appreciate that you can scroll to other color sections and also search things, including the definitions. The journal, photos, fitness, analysis sections are lovely. Appreciate the notifications and widget. Overall AWESOME, highly recommend, grateful it’s also free as I really needed this and $$ is a barrier for me.   Some changes:  1) I wish there were a way to export my data as a CSV, not just PDF. I am data minded and the PDF feels limiting, especially because it cuts off some of the data after a certain number of days. I would like to do some of my own analysis on my data… And would rather not have to figure out how to scrape it.  2) I wish there were a way to track my food intake. Even just a: big meal, medium meal, small meal, no meal. For me, food is HUGE on my mood!! Or even an alcohol/water section. Also- what about a sickness or pain section? These are hugely important on mood.  3) I know there are other apps that allow specialized mood tracking for mental health problems but it would definitely be helpful to rate intensity of some of these emotions. I recognize that some of that intensity is built into the descriptions… but I know I could benefit from some type of scale rating saying X is how intense my emotions are right now on a scale from 1 to 10. 4) New update to me makes the screen feel busier. I wish some of these new features were not necessarily buttons. Maybe that’s just me!!"

5,Tracy 1410,Thanks
3,Pinkrose064,"If being able to use more than two words to describe how you are feeling is a sign of emotional intelligence, then why is NOT possible to input more than two emotions at once??  For some people, two words might be enough, but for me, it’s not. Depending on the day, I may be able to use 10 or even 20 words, because I can be feeling several things at once. I did find the chart and the descriptions helpful for identifying what all of those emotions were, but I was frustrated that I couldn’t create one big entry. In my case, it would be far more productive to take the time to identify all of the things that I am feeling, and then be able to journal about why I am feeling each one. That would help me process each emotion, instead of just “feeling” them.  Could I do that on my own? Sure. But that defeats the purpose of the app. I should be able to do all of this within the app, or at least be able to create a single comprehensive list of my emotions in the app so that I could journal about them outside of it.  I could see it being helpful for people who have trouble even identifying their emotions to start with, but it’s not sufficient for people with a high intrapersonal intelligence. In my case, since my emotions are multifaceted, multi-layered, AND I struggle with depression, anxiety, and CPTSD, it would also be helpful to be able to track what my overall mood is. Am I in a good mood, or a bad one? Is my energy high or low? What is the sum total of all of my emotions, and what does it indicate about my current mental state? THESE are the things I need in a mental wellness app."

4,16Triley16,"This has the potential to make significant differences in people’s lives. I’m big on understanding emotions and have been looking for something exactly like this for years!   I’ve got years of DBT training under my belt along with years of therapy so please take my concerns to heart.   1. “Competent” is not an emotion. It’s a construct used by the upper class to demonize people especially minorities like the disabled. This needs to be replaced or removed completely. A kinder more accurate word could be “Able” or “functional” or simply removing it altogether seeing as “accomplished” is the same message without condescending connotations. It’s invokes a fury in me please get this elitist phrase out of this beautiful beautiful app.   2. New / More Emotions: “Dysfunctional” “introspective” “hyperactive” “hypoactive” “existential” “hyperfocused” “hypofocused” “extrospective” “closed off” “open hearted” “open minded” “close minded” “tolerant” “accepting”   [clarifications:  -Focused isn’t fully encompassing; adding hyper/hypo options would be incredibly beneficial to the autistic community, as well as educational for those that don’t know the difference. Same goes for active.  -Introspective is what I was looking for when I saw thoughtful so that’d be a nice distinction. Also Extro for when ppl feel friendly or like they want to socialize.  -It’s one thing to feel accepted it’s another to feel accepting and conversely tolerant]  I am autistic, SPD PDA low motor function etc, have CPTSD, OCD symptoms, severe anxiety and depression, as well as other neurological conditions.   The color coding and overall organization is almost perfect, I’m able to find what I’m looking for easily. It seems to be adapted from versions of the “wheel of emotions” wether it be Putnik’s or not, I am here for it!   I hope there will more colors in the future. As well as a more unbiased tone that feels compassionate & educated in the mental health field ie a field of emotions.    I know that this can help me and so many others; affecting change towards better recognizing, staying present with, understanding, managing, and accepting our emotions.  Thank you!"

5,<> () bookworm () <>,"The core feature, the check in, really helps with alexithymia. Huge variety of tools so that I don’t get frustrated because I’m plateauing with a particular tool. Replaces a lot of other apps including habit tracking, journaling, and even Spotify (if you listen to a lot of instrumental music then you’ll enjoy Sound Patterns)."

5,GGPaps,"My therapist had suggested this app to me and I didn’t think it would be all that useful but it has helped me so much with emotional regulation and actually finding the words to describe my feelings. For reference, I have with general anxiety and depression (officially diagnosed) and am working on getting an official ADHD diagnosis at my therapist’s suggestion. This app’s simple layout and detailed descriptions of emotions are very useful to me, and the check-ins are good outlets for writing about my feelings, almost functioning as a journal for me at this point. There are also breathing exercises and a variety of other tools that have helped me greatly when trying to calm myself down. It’s not anything new or unheard of, most people have probably seen or used most of the tools this app gives you. However the reason its so good is because its all in one place. You don’t have to scroll through youtube for hours trying to find videos of breathing techniques or turn your therapy session into a lecture about what emotions are and what they mean for us as people (true story has happened to me before). There are a bunch of other things i didn’t mention before too like quotes, lessons, mindfulness exercises, etc. Its overall very easy and convenient, would highly recommend to everyone even if your not necessarily struggling with your mental health."
3,YT Yesh Sesh,"I wish I could add more than one photo and video. At 5-10 pictures AND up to a minute long video. Also would love to see integration with apple music and Spotify and tag what I'm listening, including genre, or podcasts. Make an option to replace the black depressing background to a blurred color, gradient or photo posted with the journal entry. Please also add random prompts to help give ideas on what to write. We need a customizable 3-5 choice slider with color and emoji options for the emotion check-in. I find it easier to describe my emotions on a slider than to pick them."
5,Méndez2009,The free tools included as you track your habits work amazingly personally.The simplicity of tracking your emotions is really easy to be able to express your felling and helped me build a good habit to track my emotions to dictate how I should go about myself.I highly recommend how we feel

When I went to go check, a pop up with some code saying theres an error keeps appearing in the “friends” area. It also erased all history of my moods. Extremely upset!"
2,psychofrreak,"App was very useful to track my moods through the day and weeks/months and you could even add picture and customize actions locations etc. However upon updating 10/20/23 it no longer works on iOS 16.1. Crashes before it even finishes opening. I’d I have to uninstall to reinstall then I won’t bother because I’ll be losing all my data. Don’t look here for something long term as it doesn’t write to apple health, as that has no mood tracking. So if your app is corrupted, that’s it. Good while it lasted though."
4,AhoyP,"Wonderful app, but PLEASE allow account syncing and account creation/login with an option beyond just “Sign In With Apple”. Offer alternatives like a unique email/password, phone number or “Sign In With Google” that could allow common account login for a user who wants to sync across devices and do so independent of the device Apple ID and platform. An Android user switching to iOS loses their data for example or switching Apple IDs causes the account and data to be lost. Please don’t limit account creation, login, and syncing to the requirement that the user use “Sign in With Apple”. Thank you!"
3,CorCorAnonymous,So.etimes it's better said with an action than a word.
2,Jesse the K,"Looks like a great tool, but I can only read the headlines.  1. Doesn’t support Dynamic Type 2. Explanatory text is very thin, white on black therefore invisible 3. Only has dark mode .com"
4,dj phatmann,"I love the app, but doesn’t red kinda have negative connotations? If you’re trying to make a point about nonjudgmental analysis of emotions, perhaps using colors that don’t code a judgement would be more appropriate?"
5,EmJ06P,"therapist recommended this app and I use it everyday, providing as much or as little info as I want at any time. Notifications helped me build the habit. Going through major life changes are manageable & less overwhelming because I can break up my feelings and use the tools to express/track them. I’ll tell anyone with an iPhone who will listen about this app, wish my android friends could use it because they need it too!"
5,FaithCutrell,"I think the easy, yet powerful model of this is so great for people like me. It’s one of the only apps I have written an actual review for and that means I actually really, really appreciate it so much. I could rave about why I love this app but I’m short on time at the moment & don’t want to forget to write something now or I’ll forget. & this app is perfect for my many emotional issues. Thank you 🙏 It’s awesome & free & I gave them access to all my apple health stuff, by choice, because i don’t care about privacy, that literally barely exists anymore. Get this app. Please make a version of this for android users. I hate not being able to pass it on to friends who don’t have apple."
4,supernova677,Really fun app to check in with friends in a low effort way! Highly recommend! Unfortunately I cannot share with some of my friends because they do not have iPhones :(((
4,Alyjoy9,This is an awesome app but I’m very upset that it’s not available for android phones because I have some friends that I need to have on here but they can’t because they don’t have Apple phones. Please make available on more devices!!!!!!
5,ZeeWazzock,"This app is wonderful! I love it so much, the only problem is it’s only for iPhones, so my friend who has a android is unable to join in on all the fun. He feels excluded. It’s a great app!"
5,Cassiopeia135,"The ease of just finding the specific emotion you’re feeling makes such a difference. The little journey of lessons are all so approachable due to the length, the delivery, and what they’re trying to convey comes across. Honestly, it’s masterfully done. There’s so much clear and guided thought and effort behind this, I couldn’t recommend it more.  There is one issue though…  I’d really like it to be available to android. :) please get on that. This app is beautiful❤️ I desperately want to use it with some of my non-Apple users."
5,Livin with Gratitude,"This is an A+ app that is really ligit. The lessons are calm and approachable, and simply up to date.Sometimes I would like to be able to put in a pleasant and a  nonplesant emotion at the same time, but it is good in that you need to make a choice of the most felt emotion or the one that comes to mind first. Thank you for your valuable offering."
5,AshBrouwer,This app has been so critical for my self care 🤍🤍🤍 and I love checking in on my friends when they are sad or excited to share their excitement!! Best app ever!  Make it for android so I can share with more people!
4,Treyzamay,"Gave 4 stars due to there not being an android version 😕 I would so love for my clients who have android to use this. Also, small suggestion…visuals with emotion choices would be awesome, like face emojis or something that somehow can help the user better identify more closely how they are feeling in the moment. But other than that, I absolutely love this app! Amazing work!!"
5,MzNewbie,"I'm not a huge app person but I instantly fell in love with it! It's been incredibly helpful. Thanks so much for developing this app and that it is free!!!  In the last two years I've been working very hard on my development because I realized I'm dismissive avoidant and I struggle with life-long depression due to PMDD and traumatic factors. What I'm obsessed with this app is it helps show me reality vs. the stories I may be (falsely) building in my head and it's a much more positive outlook than I anticipated.   For instance, if I self report my own emotions at the end of the day, I'd probably say I feel down, blue, anxious or upset ""all"" or 75% of the time. But using the app, I'm very honest and thoughtful about what I love and the complete opposite is true--majority of the time I feel positive or good!   I realized about three days in using the app that 1) Our negative bias may inflate our perception of how frequently we *think* feel bad 2) Because negative emotions feel worse, those may make a more visceral impression and therefore we skew to thinking we feel bad much more often or much more deeply 3) My emotions are much more dynamic *towards the positive* and even though when I feel bad it seems that's the only thing I can or will ever feel, majority of the time it's actually very fleeting and I have the capacity to feel better much more quickly than I assume.  Armed with that powerful knowledge, after over 30 years of struggling with depression, I feel much more powerful and in control of code switching to a positive state than ever before! I've also supplemented it with yourpersonality.net for a more holistic view on my emotional state and progress.  THANK YOU! I've been sharing this app with everyone I know and my therapist was so excited, she now uses it for herself and recommends it to her clients.  My feedback is similar to others: - More nuance and options for emotions (One small example, sometimes I feel ""jittery"" but it's actually a good jittery. Not quite excitement because it will be tinged with apprehension, but I'd categorize as a positive emotion). - Ability to choose multiple emotions. I'll default to the one I feel most, but sometimes I'm really split. Having the ability to choose at least two, especially when they're contradictory, would be helpful because part of my struggle is when fragmented parts are fighting for control. If I could see any patterns relating to that, it could help me proactively address those situations. - More control over sleep, exercise and fitness metrics. I have iOS but use a Fitbit. It assumes I have my data in Apple health but I don't and when I tried to link it creates inaccurate counts, especially for sleep. - Options for food logging. I'd love to see if there is a correlation of diet to emotions/mental health and help determine if it is causation or correlation. (Am I craving chocolate because I have pmdd and feel bad or do I feel bad because I'm eating too much chocolate?).  Great job! Love this app. Keep up the good work."
4,TotalChris,"To start, I’ve been using HWF for a little over three weeks and I love how it’s designed, how I can schedule reminders for check ins, share with friends, and break down when I felt what I felt.  The biggest problem with How We Feel is the lack of an Android counterpart. I realize that this is a nonprofit’s pet project and it may very well be dead in the water three years from now, but I think it’d be well worth the effort. I live in a split Android/iPhone house and I want to add my other family members as friends.  Other feature suggestion, my description and where/what/who status should be shared with my friends with my emotion. I guess this works both ways, because if you can’t see those things you’re more inclined to ask that person why they feel that way in-person, but for people who are physically distant I think that’s important."
4,relatable reba,"I love this app, it’s helped me identify different emotions and will grow data to show my providers where my moods are at throughout the day.  Only downfall is my friends who have android and want to use the app can’t. It’s unavailable on the play store😕 is this only an iOS app?"
4,buhnaynay3012,"This app is a miracle, it has helped me through a lot of stress here lately and guided me through my mind.  It's simple but very effective. I've tried many apps for journaling but none are comparable to this. My only issue that causes 4/5 stars is that it's unavailable to android users. I have many friends who would benefit from this but cannot access it on their devices."
5,Havin'a'blast,How do I invite someone to share with? I sent the link and it does not add the person to your share list. Other than not knowing that this app is great
5,jennyneedsmeds,"I have tried so many mental health apps, and this one takes the cake - it’s THE BEST. I absolutely love the way it lets you choose from a group of very specific emotions, it analyzes and graphs your emotional patterns to help you gain more insight, and gives you the option to watch brief informational videos on how to identify and cope with your emotions. There may even be more features beyond this in the app that I haven’t seen yet!   The part where you check in and choose your emotion is much like the colorful “feelings wheel” I was shown by a therapist before, and I find so much comfort and confidence in being able to accurately identify/define my feelings. Also, each emotion on the list comes with a definition under it, so you don’t have to look up a word if you don’t know what it means - and you can make sure you’re choosing the most accurate word for how you’re feeling. That’s my favorite part about the app.   This is the only app where I actually remember to go check in without a reminder (although the app does offer reminder notifications if you want!), because I enjoy the process of checking in so much. And the more you check in, the more success you’ll have with the app- so that’s perfect for me.   And I love how it gives you a space to expand on that feeling with a written description if you want to. These other apps I tried just wanted you to write down how you’re feeling, but they don’t give you such an expansive and detailed list of emotions to choose from - nor did they track my progress in a way that was helpful to me. I tried that finch app and it just wasn’t for me, plus only the basic stuff was free on that app.   Also, please keep this app free!!! Please!!!! This app is helping me so much and I (along with many others I’m sure) can not afford to pay for any monthly subscriptions. And since it’s free, that makes it accessible to everyone - and a HUGE important factor of this app IS its accessibility. I will donate as soon as I am able to do so, in order to help keep it free. Thank you so much.   P.S. I found your app because of a video made by user @justjexx on TikTok. She suggested it & I’ve been trying it ever since, I love it.  The only suggestion I have for changes in the app would be 2 additional emotions for check in: grief and regret. There are many times when I wanted to check in with those specific emotions. Although it does encourage me to look deeper and get even more specific with identifying my feelings (since grief and regret can be kinda vague), so I understand if you don’t want to add them. Thanks.  Sorry for such a long review. I just feel really passionately about this."
5,avachristopher,I LOVE THIS APP. Super beneficial to check in with your emotions. It helps you become more self aware.  My only question is: How do you know what your friend code is? How do you know what your friends codes are? I shared the link with them and they downloaded the app but their names don’t appear on my app. Thank you!
3,Erica Griffin,Where do I find the friend code? My friend signed up from my link but it didn’t add her as a friend an I can’t find my friend code to share with her!
5,gardenpansy,This app is phenomenal!! I love the simplicity yet intricacy of breaking down low and high emotions into four sections! It makes it so easy to navigate especially when I’m feeling high unpleasant feelings! I don’t have to write anything if I don’t want. Also being able to look through the different words helps me calm down too somehow! I have friends who have androids and absolutely wanna have this app!! I didn’t realize how new the app is but please!! I hope the dev team is working on an accessible android version!! Thank you!!
3,Liz2910!,"I’ve tried tons of different mood apps and I really like this one. My main draw to it was being able to add friends who can see my check ins, but unfortunately I can’t add most of the important people in my life as they have Android devices. This app is aesthetically pleasing and I like the simplicity, but I probably won’t care to use it consistently until I can use the feature I wanted to use the most."
5,gfuiig4689743,"This app is free, so easy and fast to use that you wont mind doing it daily and will probably start to enjoy it. The analyzing of mood check ins are insightful and can help identify patterns in the places you go, people your with, and actives your doing. Love this app :)"
