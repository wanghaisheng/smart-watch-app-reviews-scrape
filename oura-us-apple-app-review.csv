5,zephyrdg,"PRODUCT: I don‚Äôt typically write reviews on apps, but had to for my Oura. I‚Äôve had mine for just a little over a year and have loved it. I chose the Oura because I have an analog watch that I love and I wear a lot of bracelets, so I didn‚Äôt want another thing on my wrist. Also, I have had other wrist worn activity trackers in the past and didn‚Äôt feel they were very accurate. The Oura is great because it fits with my existing jewelry. My only complaint is that I can‚Äôt do weight lifting with it because it will break (and the little nubs are painful when they dig in, I‚Äôve tried doing kettlebell or dumbbell workouts with it on)!   SERVICE: I noticed I was having to charge my ring more frequently in the last couple months, but just thought it was because I picked up my old sport of tennis again and was taxing it with more data. However, when it got to be needing a charge every 36-48 hours, I knew it wasn‚Äôt just my imagination. By the time this has happened, I had just passed my year anniversary of having the Oura (by a week). I contacted customer service (super easy through the app) and they responded right away. They mailed out a new ring for me the following day! It arrived while I was out of town, so I‚Äôve only just activated it. It was easy to delete the old ring and pair the new one. I‚Äôm happy to have it back and get back to being able to monitor my health again!"
5,NURV2600,"This ring has been an absolute game-changer for me; I've had issues sleeping my whole life, and have taken every sleeping pill on the planet, including all the heavy/narcotic ones, and I was sick of not being able to rest for days if I forgot/lost them, couldn't fill the Rx, etc. I also recently started getting back into running for the first time since high school (I'm in my mid-30s). Oura's ability to tell EXACTLY how I'm sleeping (light/deep/REM/awake), and give insights as to how my activity might be helping or hurting my ability to be well-rested the next day, is truly incredible.  Simply by wearing this regular-looking (stylish even!) ring, which is water+everything-proof, and has a full week-long battery, I can track EVERY step, heart beat, breath, and nap. I'm now completely off of all my sleeping pills (I was on seroquel, klonopin, and Ambien!), exercising comfortably (usually not more than Ours says is necessary that day), just overall living a MUCH healthier life!  My only feature request would be to be able to MANUALLY SELECT WHICH RESTFUL PERIOD IS COUNTED AS YOUR SLEEP EVENT! I often work crazy hours, and if I nap from 1-2am for example, that'll sometimes get counted as my sleep for that day, not my actual sleep from 7am-2pm (which IS recorded properly as a ""restful event"", but with only a single HR/HRV value). Other than that, it's perfect!"
5,TheBettyRocker,"I‚Äôve had an Oura ring since it was a big black pebble and kept upgrading as they went. It has such an impact on my daily health choices and how mindful I am about simple things like walking more and consistent bedtimes. It‚Äôs changed my mindset subtly - the scores keep me tuned into my behaviors in ways other things don‚Äôt. Having the new data to track basal body temp for monitoring my cycle more easily is an amazing upgrade, but it was already awesome before they added that feature. It‚Äôs small, light, the charge lasts for days and days, the information and features they continue to provide in the app are valuable without being overwhelming and having 5+ years of data is amazing to look back on. Being able to consistently measure HRV is essential and my doctor is a big fan of the tech too and we use the data for our work together as well.  The app developers spend the time listening to their customers and invest in keeping the app updated and their customer support is fantastic. This app and this device are the best thing out there and the value is excellent for what you get. Have recommended it to so many friends and family members who now swear by it too."
3,HDPhotpink,"I got this ring to pair with Natural Cycles. Prior to this week it would take literally forever for my temperature to sync with the app (sometimes an hour!). Interestingly enough as soon as they had competition in the new Apple Watch they fixed the issue people have been complaining about for months. Crazy how that works ü§™. Overall the app insights are super interesting, I have an infant that obviously wakes during the night and this helps me to keep up with her wakings as well as mine. It‚Äôs also cool to see the heart rate and stress tracking. The workout tracking is only mildly accurate I would say but that‚Äôs not what I bought the ring for.   I‚Äôm the most disappointed in the new subscription thing they‚Äôve got going on. ‚ÄúSpend $500 on our ring with all these features, and then you can pay us even more money to use them! Isn‚Äôt that fun???‚Äù It makes me question why in the world I spent the extra money on the newest ring when the old one has the same features as you get without the subscription for less cost. It‚Äôs just a shame to see the greed in these companies. I don‚Äôt know if I would recommend it to other people moving forward. At the least the Apple Watch has other features, and you don‚Äôt have to pay monthly to use them!"
3,Roseredsiren,"There‚Äôs a lot I like- can wear the ring in the shower and pool with no fuss. It‚Äôs more comfortable to sleep in than the Fitbit. Long battery life. I love that it does oxygen saturation and basal temp. As someone with wonky cycles and sleep I‚Äôve always wanted to track my temp, but id forget and get up before doing it or my wonky sleep would affect the data. But I hate that it doesn‚Äôt tell me the actual temp. It also has a major flaw in that you can‚Äôt tell it that you have a fever and to disregard those days temps. Even if you tag fever/cold it still gets confused and thinks that you‚Äôve ovulated. It thinks my period should start today when I know from other symptoms it‚Äôs 10-14 days away still. It‚Äôs better at detecting naps than the Fitbit, but it still will miss them and I want a way to tell the app I slept. Also I want to know just a basic daily resting heart rate like my Fitbit. I always know from that simple data when I‚Äôve ovulated and when the cycle is ending. Also as someone who has Fibromyalgia it needs a recalibration on readiness. Or a way to give feed back on not feeling well because I‚Äôm sorry but 5hr sleep should not regularly correlate with 70+% readiness. Even for a healthy person. I love that it‚Äôs a ring. I love that it does temp and heart rate and oxygen. I want simpler straight forward raw data, that I can interpret myself. Thanks."
5,Many Disappointed Users,"Love everything about my third gen Oura ring. I‚Äôve had it for almost 2 years and wear it every day. Unlike my Apple Watch I feel like this is light and I often forget I‚Äôm wearing it. I also feel more comfortable swimming and sweating in it, so A+ on the hardware! On the software side I think it‚Äôs mostly good though I wish I could actually see my spo2 data in a line graph over time. There‚Äôs a lot of data I imagine you‚Äôre collecting and I simply get no benefit because I can‚Äôt see it, all I see is a an interpretation of the data such as ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù but not the data itself. Lastly please please please change the Heart Health art in the app, it‚Äôs creepy! I feel anxious every time I open the app and see this weirdmy wispy humanoid in a falling pose 1‚Äôs I find myself scrolling past that section as quickly as possible to avoid that. I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm in the minority in my strong dislike but still I‚Äôm also certain there are countless other images you could have in that section that wouldn‚Äôt evoke such a strong reaction in people like me that apparently have a fear response to wispy falling people."
3,tabbiek,"This is a new review after finally getting some straight answers after 8 months of inquisition.I‚Äôve had the Gen 2 which had to be replaced due to faulty battery and then paid almost full price (only about $75 discount) to upgrade  to Gen 3. That was quite costly to NOT get all the allegedly upgrades of the Gen3. The ‚Äúlifetime membership ‚Äú is the ability to use the same app I‚Äôve always had but not have to pay a monthly subscription to use it now. But you need the app to use the ring. So not only do you pay hundreds of dollars for the product but unless you pay for monthly subscription you WON‚Äôt get the benefits of the gen3 since you won‚Äôt have access to the parts of the app to read the data. By the way live heart rate is only available on 4 select activities you have to choose before starting them . Which you use select in the app before the activity or you won‚Äôt get a reading. The ring isn‚Äôt intuitive enough to record you‚Äôve done something. It is truly only good at reading üò¥ üõå. But there is still no pulse ox SpO2 and it‚Äôs the only reason I upgraded from the Gen2. So for now I just use my Garmin watch. For everyday activity it‚Äôs NOT going to give you the data you need- not yet- not by far. Get an Apple, FitBit, or Garmin for that. If you just want to monitor sleep then this is for you."
3,Jacattack2,"Occasionally I‚Äôll wake up around 3 am for various reasons and it will take me some time to get back to sleep. It could take 30 minutes, it could take 2 hours, but according to Oura if I don‚Äôt fall right back to sleep then I‚Äôm up for the rest of the day and I have only had 3 or 4 hours of sleep for the night.  I am supposed to be able to manually edit my sleep hours but I guess because it shows activity for too long of a period I am unable to do this. So rather than counting those hours of sleep that follow it just looks like long spaces of inactivity. I‚Äôll wake up and have dreamt in that period of sleep, so I‚Äôm not sure how it isn‚Äôt registering as even light sleep like the rest of the night does. Regardless, it‚Äôs not completely accurate if I actually get 6 or 7 hours of sleep and feel more rested than the ring and app show. It affects all of my data, trends and patterns, etc. which is the general point of the ring; sleep being one of the more important for me. I was hoping the most recent firmware update would help address this but it did not. I‚Äôm happy to update my review if Oura is able to find a way address this issue. I‚Äôve had Fitbits and Misfits that didn‚Äôt have issues recognizing when I was asleep and when I was awake so it‚Äôs just a matter of some tweaking."
2,Really awesome game!,"Unfortunately, this app and the ring don‚Äôt actually add much value to anything. It does not do a great job at fitness/activity tracking, it tracks your hear rate just like every other device out there does, it makes up ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù scores that don‚Äôt really tell you anything you don‚Äôt already know. My readiness is 82! What does that even mean? How does this help me?  The only thing that might set this apart is the sleep tracking function. I‚Äôm sorry to say it is pretty much worthless. I have sleep issues and just did a full, in-lab polysomnogram: you‚Äôre hooked to a pulse oximeter, EKG, full EEG, they monitor your movements etc. I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea with an AHI of 45 (that‚Äôs a measure of how many times an hour you stop breathing and your oxygen levels fall at least 3%). Normal is less than 5. My lowest oxygen level was 74%!  On the same night, my ring and the app said I had a sleep score of 82, and my breathing during sleep was ‚Äúgood‚Äù and my oxygen level average was 98%. Completely divorced from actual reality, but worse: this ‚Äúdata‚Äù from oura is dangerously wrong. If I believed the ring, I would think I was doing fine. Untreated severe sleep apnea is life threatening and must be treated. I would advise you to stay away from using this product. It‚Äôs useless at best and dangerously wrong at worst."
1,alanak2580,"So on top of the $300 ring you get to pay a $6 monthly fee‚Ä¶for a ring that is entirely inaccurate. I wear my smartwatch and ring to bed; the smartwatch has consistently been more accurate with my sleep. The main reason I ordered this ring was to see my ‚Äúreadiness score‚Äù as I am someone who regularly struggles with low energy and would like to know what days to take it easy. Every day my readiness score is more or less the same and it hasn‚Äôt detected my energy crashes. I‚Äôve worn this ring almost daily for nearly 2 months now. Still paying the subscription fee in hopes to get some value out of this app‚Ä¶because if I don‚Äôt that means I wasted $300 on the ring. Lol, if I could go back, I would have spared the trouble and never would have purchased it. I don‚Äôt understand the good reviews.  I have seen some people want this ring because it will track their body temperature for the Natural Cycles app, my thoughts on that are 1. Based on my current experience with this ring and inaccuracy, I really would not trust it with something as important as birth control and 2. Natural Cycles is another subscription fee, so that‚Äôs another monthly commitment your bank account will be making.   Once again I‚Äôve learned the lesson that if something sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Best just save your money and stick to a smartwatch."
5,poneycakes,"I am a huge fan of the Oura ring. I purchased one three years ago during an acute time of healing and have used it as a major part of my recovery. It‚Äôs super encouraging to be able to collect metrics over the years and see trends of improvement. I love that the ring talks to you specifically and every month and year they give you a review. I love the added improvements of tracking your menstral cycle, temperature, and blood oxygen. I love that you can turn it off Bluetooth to reduce EMF and only turn it on to update and get your readings. I find I am more conscious of my sleep. The feedback they give is really encouraging, never fearful. I lost my ring once and they were super helpful with that and then when I bought the new generation and the update glitched the ring so it couldn‚Äôt charge, they took accountability and sent me a new one no questions asked. A really great company, invested in the customer and it is evident. Think Fitbit but even more data and a ring. Oh- and I forgot to add, I like their meditations and breathwork that they offer."
4,AllysKK,"Dec 2023 update: something quirky going on with the new Tagging feature. I added a tag to yesterday but it‚Äôs associating it with today. I try to go and delete the tag from yesterday and can‚Äôt find where to do this. There is no ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù for the day for me to select and see the Tags as their website suggests.  Previous and still valid review: My primary issue is that the ring thinks I‚Äôm sleeping or napping when I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôll be fully awake and it will think I‚Äôm sleeping- it even believed that I‚Äôm in deep sleep! I‚Äôm not sure why- I do have a very low heart rate. But then I‚Äôll have a decent nights sleep (just based on my lack of insomnia and the the feeling of being alert and rested) and it will tell me I had no deep sleep. And currently the app is only letting me adjust my bedtime and not my wake up time. So it essentially thinks I go to bed at 530p and get up at 930a. Even when I‚Äôve successfully adjusted the times, the app will revert back to the original times. Arghh! But I like the ring enough to have gone ahead and upgraded to the new Gen 3. I like seeing my HRV, HR and body temp. It has helped me realize how bad it is to eat late."
3,Missysmc,"There are things I love about this app like monitoring my hrv and how many hrs of sleep I‚Äôm getting. That is how many hrs I‚Äôm getting at night. I frequently take naps during the day they are very much needed for me to feel 100%. Unfortunately the app only tracks maybe 1 of 3 or 4 naps. I‚Äôve had the ring for almost a year now so I think I have a good idea of what it can do. I frequently look at this data to help gage my physical health especially dealing with a chronic pain condition knowing where I‚Äôm at helps. As a female it‚Äôs important to know our cycles and temperatures which the app sort of tracks. Basically you get your estimated start day and can track day one but no other data can be collected for that week, so it‚Äôs not accurate for tracking also it only gives a warmer or cooler temperature gage while sleeping but not your actual temperature. The ring battery life is now only a couple days. I put mine on airplane mode at night so I get a bit more time per charge. I would have to say I liked the gen 3 ring way better back in February, march & april of 2022. Now it‚Äôs trying to collect too much data which would be fine if the data it collected was full data not just a hodgepodge of bits and pieces."
1,Dr.TST,"It goes without saying this is an awesome product. Read the reviews below. As for customer service, there basically isn‚Äôt any. There is no phone number to call and my emails have been answered on average 10 days after being sent. The email responses reveal that the sender never looked at my email or considered my situation and just sent out a cut and pasted form letter response.  All I am trying to do is exchange my 2nd Generation ring for a 3rd generation ring. I never received any email instructions with QR codes telling me how to do this. Two emails (each 10 days apart for a total of 20 days) were sent to me saying I must have received the instruction. I didn‚Äôt. I am not an idiot.  I did place an order in the meantime and got an order #.  I finally, after 1 month, got an email with instructions on how to return my 2nd generation ring. I had to start by entering in my order #. The order number was not accepted saying this was an unrecognized order #. I screenshot my order # and the page stating it‚Äôs an unrecognized # and emailed this to customer service and now, 2 weeks later, still no response. In my 62 years I honestly can say I have never dealt with a company with such horrible customer service. And I am sorry, but ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù and ‚Äúunprecedented backlog of our products‚Äù is absolutely no excuse."
3,iamunscared,"First this is a fantastic product for tracking and understanding trends. It‚Äôs functionality with the app, and the fact that it‚Äôs a ring is incredible.  Second, HRV and heart rate are starting to fade out in terms of accurate assessment as HRV systems are not all the same... you will see in Formula1 racing they no longer use these things. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs decent for the public to play with. Oura does not track heart rate or HRV very clearly. I‚Äôve tested this against several other products and devices. Most of which are incredibly well tested. Ive spoken with several other users, and they are getting the same information. For instance, when Oura tells me my RHR was 58 last night, then I put on a medical grade HR/SPO2 monitor and sit down (mind you I‚Äôm not lying down asleep) and my HR is at 52, that is a significant difference in terms of testing. This is a problem. BUT, I digress and will say that the ability to track over time and see where you make specific changes or trends is great, and the portability is top notch. $299+ will need to change... but there are plenty of ‚Äúhackers‚Äù afraid of dying who will gladly pay for the next technological product to get them further away from feeling what they are plenty capable of feeling without the tech."
4,Bob and Sue,"The Oura ring is a great wearable. Lightweight, attractive, with good battery life. The sleep stage graphs in the app are much more correlated with my lived experience than any purely app-based sleep tracker I‚Äôve tried, so I trust Oura‚Äôs technology.  One thing that disappoints me is the small amount of information made available to me. I can find no way to export granular raw data for doing my own analyses. And neither the app nor the online dashboard supports views I would like to see, such as how my body temperature fluctuates throughout the day. (There is a relationship between body temperature and sleep.)   In general, I would love to see more emphasis on helping people understand what daytime factors influence their sleep (onset of sleepiness, regularity and duration of sleep stages, premature wake-ups, etc). This would empower people to take steps to improve their sleep quality. The data is there. Hopefully these features will be added in the future. If Oura doesn‚Äôt have the resources to do this effectively in-house, they could consider partnering with universities, the way they have for Covid studies. Sleep is absolutely critical for human health, so it deserves this level of attention."
4,BldBernee,"I‚Äôve had the Oura ring since 2019 and had the 1st Gen ring. I got the new ring and I am happy with all of the upgrades they have made. Oura is constantly making upgrades and adding new features. The only upgrade that I don‚Äôt like is they changed the sleep and I find it‚Äôs not as accurate. Sometimes it indicates that I was awake for 2 hours during the night and I slept all night. Maybe it‚Äôs because I am an active sleeper and talk in my sleep! Or that it cannot differentiate between N1 and N2 sleep. Oura‚Äôs customer service is excellent and every time I‚Äôve reached out I get a response immediately and a resolution. The ring is pretty accurate otherwise and it tells me to slow down when I am under the weather. I use the readiness to help determine when to workout and to slow down and that has helped in preventing me to get sick! It was interesting to see when I got the Covid vaccine, the ring knew something was off! I would give it 5 stars if the sleep data was more accurate. Finally, sometimes it picks up my naps and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt! Not sure why!"
1,blaakpilot,"I was gifted an Oura ring from my job a few months ago, and at first everything worked fine. Once about a month after I got it, the ring disappeared from my Bluetooth list of devices, and after trying to find it again per the Oura online instructions, I ended up having to delete and redownload the app, and it worked. Fast forward 3 months, and the ring disappeared again. This time, reloading the app didn‚Äôt work, and my online account I set up when I first used the ring completely disappeared. I could no longer log into my account as my email was no longer recognized, and my ring either is just dead or isn‚Äôt broadcasting anymore. It‚Äôs as if my account was just deleted from their servers. On the app, I can‚Äôt get past a screen that tells me to connect to an Oura ring, which I can‚Äôt do. I contacted customer service via email, and they weren‚Äôt able to do anything. They said I‚Äôd be contacted by the warranty department, and that was weeks ago. When the ring and app worked, they were very helpful health monitoring tools. When they don‚Äôt work, you‚Äôre pretty much out of luck. The only good news is I didn‚Äôt pay for this; I‚Äôd be pretty upset if I paid out of pocket and all I have to show for it is a microchipped hematite ring."
1,Sophia Harlow 345,"I bought my Oura ring a matter of weeks before the cut off of the new Oura ring. For reference, I got my Mom a ring at the 2 weeks after for her birthday and they automatically gave her a Gen 3. I followed up multiple times with customer service to see about upgrading or returning or trading in and they weren‚Äôt helpful. They are sticking to their arbitrary cut off date and totally f*cling their customers in the process.  We all got an over the top email from the CEO promising a big deal but the deal ended within a matter of days of the email and tracking down customer service to figure it all out was a mess. For instance, I had to email customer service 3 times through 2 different methods before getting any response. I‚Äôm sure the Gen 3 will track certain things more effectively as right now Gen 2 clearly gets thrown by certain things. Anyway, I‚Äôd heard such good things but was really let down by my experience. It‚Äôs been exhausting to try to figure it all out and I really wanted them to be better then they turned out to be. It‚Äôs like chasing a company down a rabbit hole to get any kind of answer. Hope they figure it out and meanwhile, I‚Äôm not so sure if there‚Äôs a truly authentic source on their product to be honest."
1,RealTalk54546,"It is so bad I am wiring my first review on an app - ever. Oura removed the ease of navigating the app and the visual overviews so now you have to hunt for info. It isn‚Äôt easy to find previous days‚Äô data or trends anymore and the app is cluttered but not with useful info - just topic headers. It almost feels like they purposefully made it hard and time-consuming to increase user engagement time with being active in the app. I can‚Äôt think of a single other reason to make it so unfriendly for users. It is horrible. I won‚Äôt be replacing my Oura ring when it finally dies and I am canceling my subscription since the data I pay to view requires hunting scrolling through 12 different topics now, and trends are basically hidden. The basic app is about the same as what you pay for now unless you have extra hours on your day for hunt and peck, taking screenshots, and then doing a comparison of those screenshots in your Photos app. Oura - you failed.  Edited to add that MEN must have made the decisions on this horrible UX, because navigating on the app to find a calendar display of your cycle takes a bit of work. Calendar should be the default view and I should be able to see the other days logged so far when logging a period day. Infuriating."
5,JohnTravels,"UPDATE - World Class Response - Oura responded with full replacement within 48 hours. A great product which I depend upon and a company that went above and beyond. The world needs more companies like Oura!  BATTERY PROBLEM!!! I am a fan and the ring has changed and improved my life, sleep specifically. I have used the ring for two years. It has worked perfectly until the most recently. I have contacted Oura about the loss of battery life which occurred suddenly - prior to the 1/24 firmware update the battery lasted several days at a time, since the update it dies in under 6 or 7 hours. Won‚Äôt hold data overnight. I contacted Oura and wrote that the ring is two years old and battery life crashed after firmware update - they wrote back that the ring has a battery issue and a warranty team member will contact me, presumably to tell me what I told them - I purchased the ring two years ago and so sorry! Stay tuned,,, well I am astonished that my ring is being replaced! Kudos Oura!"
5,WIllygee1,My wife and I have been wearing the rings for months now. I would call us product advocates since we too have found the information very useful. The rings are stylish and practical. The data provided is extensive and useful. A friend shared an article that noted the rings are not very accurate. They compared it to a sophisticated medical device. While good insight I would hardly expect a $300 ring to perform at the same level as a medical device that would cost multiples of this product. The medical grade technology is also not comfortable and would not be used daily. The author also ‚Äúargues‚Äù with the rings comparing how he felt to what the ring stated. Odd thing to do. I find it reliable and tends to be pretty accurate about things like the difference between when I have ingested alcohol or not. The difference is as dramatic as it‚Äôs supposed to be. I recommend you look at this as a tool and not necessarily a medical grade device. It can provide useful insights as to how your behavior is affecting your sleep and vice versa.
3,Jojo_beee,"I bought the Oura ring years ago and felt it could be better. I recently bought it again, hoping that it would have more ergonomic and intuitive user interface on the app. The app does not present information easily. With as much money, you are spending on the ring and then as much money that we‚Äôre paying monthly the information could be presented to the users easily. For instance, why do we have to scroll through when there can easily be a dashboard for all the information? You have to dig for the information you want if there was a dashboard you could click on ideal information that you‚Äôre interested in looking further into, but you have to scroll all the way down and really dig for what you‚Äôre trying to find. Really not satisfied and it‚Äôs unfortunate because the rings are expensive. I don‚Äôt think the company is focusing on the user as much as they should. All the information is wonderful, but making sure that the users can actually access that information easily quickly and intuitively would be ideal. Hoping they get better!"
3,EMP20142014,"I bought this for my sleep tracking, and for that purpose it has worked well. But the Activity and ‚ÄúReadiness‚Äù scores/tracking is completely useless. I am an armchair athlete who is in great shape and works out regularly, with a combination of cardio and strength training of various types, including tennis etc. Every day since I have gotten it, the ring suggests that my readiness is Low and that I should have an active calorie burn of about 150 calories. Which I can get walking around the house in a day, with no real exercise. Supposedly the NBA players are using this (can‚Äôt imagine what their readiness scores are!) I wish the Oura were ‚Äúsmart,‚Äù meaning it gets to know me and my body and my activity trends, and then could compare my readiness to my average, not some generalized person with a much lower assumed level of fitness and exercise. Or it could allow you to pick from some profiles where one is an active athlete. As it is now, a potentially valuable part of the system- Readiness and Activity recommendations- are completely useless. If you read reviews, you can see this is a common complaint. I hope Oura sees and is working on this!"
4,ace apertura,"The ring is pretty useful for activity tracking. I was disappointed it does not record temperature (only some warmer/colder scores). It essentially also only tracks heart rate when asleep. I love the one week battery life time though. The app is intuitive and shows a good overview of sleep information and breathing rate etc. Nicely integrated with Apple Health Kit.  Breaking news: The ring has a sensor to measure your weight and height. Or so it claims because it requests write access to your height and weight .... Seriously?  Update: Thanks for the dev response. Nevertheless, you should still display the raw body temperature somewhere even if the change is more interesting to look at. Ideally share the temperature into HealthKit if that's what you track anyhow or maybe share one value per night. Likewise it'd be great to have a choice to sometimes track HR/HRV when sitting still for long enough during the day (at the expense of battery). It's clunky to have to run find the phone for that. And fix the access right bug where Oura requires write access to height and weight."
1,RoNIN5IN,I bought the previous generation ring and was fairly satisfied with the product even with a customer service issue when I had to exchange the first one - despite this I decided to buy the current generation because I had an opportunity to get this ring without having to get signed up for the subscription service (as a current ring owner) that Oura out of nowhere forced on customers (I would definitely not pay a subscription) since I was already a customer - I again had to exchange the first ring in the new generation due to it malfunction - three times in the last two weeks this new ring when I have gone to look at my sleep score shows nothing and I had do a soft reboot get it working again for the next night - there are also constant ‚Äúfirmware updates‚Äù so who knows if this is the reason for that‚Ä¶I had no score today and had to do an update and looking back this seemed to have happened around the same time as the problem with getting a score - customer service is an endless loop of having answer this and do that and still no change - very disappointed in a pretty big purchase that doesn‚Äôt perform consistently
4,rbgood,"I‚Äôve had the Oura ring for a while now and I love the data but when there‚Äôs an issue, it is very difficult now to get the right support. Because they have handed over the support to AI. It‚Äôs difficult to read way through to somebody human. In my case, I‚Äôm having to resort to write a review here because after exploring the Support options can‚Äôt seem to get help. So here‚Äôs my issue. I usually walk between 45 to 60 minutes a day. Sometimes the distance recorded is accurate and sometimes it‚Äôs not. Yesterday, for example I walked almost an hour and I was, recorded to have walked 2.2 miles today. I walked over an hour and it said I walked 1 mile. This happened repeatedly lately. It‚Äôs a new issue for me. I tried Finn, the AI chat bought and that was a joke. Useless for me. On several occasions, I‚Äôve tried to weed through it and no. When I click on email support, it shows me past emails, but it doesn‚Äôt give me a window to start a new email. Let‚Äôs see if I can get some help using this option."
5,Sexy Donovan,"Oura creates a user-interface that is intuitive, insightful, & inspiring providing the user with a wide-range of data (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate, sleep temperature, sleep cycles, & more). Not only does is the Oura app provide daily insights, but it shows you these parameters over many days/weeks/months allowing you to TRULY understand your body in its slow, natural timeframe.  By equipping the ring w/ many sensors, the Oura software team has HUGE potential to use AI in order to fully understand your daily habits in ways that you may not. As of 2020, Oura has yet to release any real-time data visualizations, but through further software development, I believe Oura will seamlessly incorporate new ways to process & analyze the large datasets being recorded by the Oura ring.  For those who THRIVE on self-improvement & find STRENGTH through understanding, the stunning Oura ring provides you with the crystal clear picture of your vitals & shows you the HUGE importance of seeking out that perfect night‚Äôs sleep."
5,ArmigerMama,"I was highly skeptical when a friend of mine who was also treating me for issues related to stress recommended this ring to me. I broke down and bought the ring and it really changed me. I am a data scientist by trade and that‚Äôs why I was a skeptic at first. I wasn‚Äôt totally sure if the app can really come up with intelligent feedback. But it does. I changed my sleep pattern and really try hard to take breaks and move more. I co-own a consultancy/agency and my days are always crazy between work and family. I felt like I never had time for myself, or I never had enough justification to give myself time for self care. This app did just that. It tells me exactly what I need - go to sleep early, push yourself harder, take it easy, don‚Äôt eat too close to sleep time, etc. I love fitness and I love how the app is designed for overall fitness, not just steps, weight and calories. The sync works like a charm. Battery holds well. App is very intuitive."
3,Eric_WS41981,"I purchased the Oura Ring strictly to collect accurate sleep data.  Exactly how much sleep do I get each night?   I will typically wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. Or I will wake up very early and not be able to fall asleep for the remainder of the night.  After three weeks of usage, I‚Äôve determined that the Oura ring cannot accurately detect when I am actually asleep and when I am awake.  If I‚Äôm lying awake in bed from 2-4am the ring will say I fell back into REM sleep or light sleep.  There is no way to manually change this reading. If I wake up early but do not get out of bed the ring will think I‚Äôm still sleeping. At least the app will allow me to manually change my morning wake up time.  Why not allow us to make manual changes to the middle of the night data?  Better yet, improve the accuracy of the readings so that it can actually tell the difference between awake and sleep.  It‚Äôs still a helpful tool, but it falls short of my expectations. . . Waiting for some more improvements."
2,Buzz79,"I bought the Oura ring primarily for sleep tracking. Unfortunately, it works poorly for this due to a design choice that Ours views as a feature not a bug. Here is the problem - when I get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom (and as I‚Äôm a man over 60, this is basically every night), the sleep tracking records either the period before I got up or the period after. There is no way to correct the period in the app. You can shorten the period it records as sleep but not lengthen it. When I contacted Oura about this they confirmed that that is how the App works and said that if I was to adjust the period to lengthen it I might corrupt the data and get inaccurate stats. I don‚Äôt understand how the results could possibly be worse than they are when half of the time I was asleep are missing. I have been using a Fitbit for sleep tracking and it‚Äôs not any better at automatically handling this situation but the software allows you to manually correct the sleep period. If Oura allowed me to do this I would give it five stars. Since they don‚Äôt I‚Äôm probably going to return the ring."
5,CDawg!,"First off, I love my Oura 4 ring. It has freed me from the tyranny of my smartwatch, and I‚Äôm now back to enjoying my collection of fine timepieces only choosing to wear my Apple Watch Ultra when I exercise. The sleep tracking and HRV measurements are also more precise than the Apple Watch, and the Oura, overall, takes more of a general wellness - rather than fitness - approach to monitoring your wellbeing, which I appreciate. And now for a feature suggestion/request: Is it possible to add a smart alarm to awaken the user in a light phase of sleep close to their alarm wake-up time? Apps such as SleepCycle and Sleepzy have this functionality, and it would be great if Oura - with it‚Äôs precision sleep stage monitoring - had this functionality along with an Apple Watch integration that could trigger the alarm on the watch in a light phase of sleep. Thank you for making such an excellent wellness device."
1,flykitemindfind,"Dude. This app in general is actually fantastic. I completely recommend it.   I must add, however, that there‚Äôs a bug that slightly disgraces the quality of the rest of the app. That‚Äôs the exercise calories. I usually mix running and lifting in my workouts. I measure my heart rate during that time to log my workouts. The calories during the workout, I choose ‚Äúoutdoor running‚Äù because it‚Äôs the closest option to what I do, depend on *time* and not on how much work you did or how far you ran. This is a ridiculous heuristic, and considering the sophistication in the rest of the app, is a real shame. The other day, I accidentally forgot to ‚Äúend my workout‚Äù on the app. When I finally realized 25 hours later, the app logged that I spend 16,000 calories!!!!!!!! And I couldn‚Äôt erase that, even after deleting the workout lol. Other than my workout, I had walked and sat around all day. NOT spending 16,000 calories. This has got to be fixed man that‚Äôs absurd. It insults anyone serious about working out.   Thus, once this is fixed, I‚Äôm changing my review to 5 stars. Until then, one star."
5,SumSlev,"I often won‚Äôt buy something linked to an app because a lot of times, the product can be great but the app is garbage. But not this one! The ring is amazing and the app is completely functional and I‚Äôve never had a glitch in the couple of years I‚Äôve had my ring. Their support is great, they really work with you to ensure you‚Äôre happy with their product. And the data I‚Äôve gotten from my ring is life changing. I‚Äôve changed my eating, sleeping and drinking habits to get better deep sleep and I can tell the difference that‚Äôs reflected in the sleep stats. It gives me tips for improvement and it‚Äôs all based on my own data. I also know when my period is coming - I hope they release more features for that. Overall, it‚Äôs an excellent product and I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to bio hack their body and live a better life!"
3,Ride_zone,"The ring is great and I‚Äôve really enjoyed the sleep tracking and readiness insights for the past few months.   However, it‚Äôs really far behind as a fitness tracker. You can only record workout heart rates for indoor/outdoor running and cycling or walking - nothing else. And if you do another workout like weightlifting, playing soccer, etc, you just have to hope that the ring notices you‚Äôre active. After the workout, if it noticed that you were active, you can choose from a massive list of activities - but ONLY after and IF it notices you were moving. Mine hardly notices it if I‚Äôm lifting or playing a sport or anything like that.   It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me that you can‚Äôt indicate another sport or activity prior to a workout or even select ‚Äúother‚Äù before a workout and choose from the list they already have after. For the price of the ring and the technology in it, it should have a bit more flexibility for people who are even somewhat active."
2,Therealengali,"I‚Äôve had this ring for years for sleep monitoring. I only recently started really using the Activity tracker for steps in a day. It is way off. I have been walking on a treadmill while working and kept the ring on my finger and the phone in my pocket. I walked about 7000 steps according to the treadmill itself. Apple Health states I have walked 9,226 so far today. Oura states I have walked 2,922 today.  Yesterday I ran into the same problem and I thought it was because I had my phone on my desk rather than in my pocket. But now it‚Äôs clear that Oura doesn‚Äôt use the data from the sensors in the phone itself like Apple Health does and relies only on the ring itself. If I am walking and typing at the same time, my phone in my pocket will pick up my steps, but the ring will not because it‚Äôs remaining steady. Either that or the Oura step is not using the phone sensor data correctly. Either way, massively disappointed in something that was nearly half a grand. It makes me wonder how good the sleep tracking is. I will do a sleep study soon and find out‚Ä¶"
3,Mickey8218,"I love my Oura ring and the app. I recommend the product as much as I can. This is why I beg Oura to rethink their subscription model. I do not mean get rid of it, but rather make it fair and logical. Remember your mission and understand that your customers picked Oura because it gave us a simple and complete way to understand our health without a subscription. It is my understanding that if you do not pay for the subscription for your Oura ring 3 you will only get your 3 scores but not the deep data that comes with it such as temp, HRV, sleep data and more. These scores are useless without this deep data. Oura please make this deep data available to non subscribers, and have a subscription for anything else that is extra. We are already investing $300 or more for the ring so please drop the paywall, at least when it comes to the deep data for the 3 main scores. I still love my ring and the app but I can no longer just recommend Oura to anyone. Thank you."
3,AliNitro,"I‚Äôve had my ring for about 6 weeks. I like it, don‚Äôt love it, have some major gripes. The first major gripe is that I am only getting a successful heart rate recording during my workouts 30% of the time 6:19 workouts where I clicked the ‚Äúrecord hr workout‚Äù button and recorded a workout to be exact. The only tip I get from the app is to make sure the ring is snugly fit on my finger. I have indents on my finger, how much more snugly should it fit? This brings me to my second major gripe - I don‚Äôt appreciate that the app is actively using my location services / tracking my movements at all times.  This is only necessary when I‚Äôm recording an actual workout.  I end up force quitting the app when I‚Äôm not using it.   The data I get from the app is interesting, it‚Äôs nice to see the trends. I like that it integrates with apple health app. I don‚Äôt know if I will continue to keep the subscription if I can‚Äôt get a better record of workout HR though."
1,lameychang,"I recently invested a hefty $300 in an Oura Ring, only to discover that it‚Äôs essentially useless without an additional subscription. The marketing promises a wealth of insightful data to improve your health and well-being, but what they don‚Äôt tell you is that this data is locked behind a paywall.  Without the subscription, you‚Äôre left with a glorified piece of jewelry that offers minimal functionality. The initial cost of the ring should be enough to provide full access to all features, but Oura has chosen to squeeze more money out of their customers. This feels like a blatant cash grab and an insult to those who have already invested a significant amount in their product.  For those considering a wearable to track health and fitness, I strongly recommend looking at alternatives like the Apple Watch. Not only does it provide comprehensive health data right out of the box, but it also offers a plethora of additional features that the Oura Ring simply can‚Äôt match. Save your money and avoid the frustration‚Äîgo with a device that truly delivers value."
2,GrouchyOldMan,"Unfortunately, if you want a wearable for Sleep Tracking, and you work Overnights or Split Shifts in the evenings, this is not the device for you. It works well for everything else, but cannot accurately measure your sleep time, if you are in bed during daylight hours.  When it uploads your data, it will report you had Zero sleep time (hours & minutes) for that ‚ÄúDay,‚Äù or skew the results by adding in some of the hours of your previous ‚ÄúNight‚Äù and report you had 10, 12 or 14 hours of ‚ÄúOptimal Sleep.‚Äù  My other devices, - I have two of the major brands of watches - accurately report my sleep period during my day in hours and minutes, without skewing the data.  For example, my OURA Ring reports 9 Hours 51 Minutes of Sleep today, and Samsung reports 6 Hours and 11 Minutes, which is correct.    Hopefully, some day (or night !) in the future, they‚Äôll figure out how to make the ring work for someone like me.  I will continue to  purchase every upgrade, in anticipation of that day."
5,KeepCalm1111,"I love my Oura ring and give it 5 stars so far (I am 2-3 months in.) my only wish is that there were a section for women regarding menopause. It felt a bit traumatic as a women just heading into the big M, to not be able to relate to the period phases and to turn off all of the womanly tracking. I wish there was a menopause section for learning and tracking symptoms. Somehow turning the features off made me really sad and I felt separate. (I know that is a me thing!) I also wish there were half sizes. I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of two sizes. I would love a little more guidance on how to improve my sleep. It‚Äôs not good! I‚Äôm actually getting a sleep study in a few weeks after seeing my sleep scores. Or maybe it‚Äôs the night sweats. üôÉ They really affect sleep, yall! Thank you, Oura. Keep making it better and better!"
4,Jarymokin,"After wearing a fitbit fir years, i purchased an Oura ring. i like to compare the two results in the morning.  They sometimes have similar results but mostly different.  Oura alway records more deep sleep ,rem sleep and sleep in general.  i wish i knew the accuracy of either.  The oura does make me feel better about my sleep because it records more. i think the power of suggestion works so well that it makes me feel like ive had much better sleep.  i dont understand the heart rate results or some of the other things it records but im sure that will come.   I wear the Oura ring on my thumb, first finger or middle finger. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm  a smurf that the same ring fits all 3 fingers but it‚Äôs nice to be able to move it around.  i usually don‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs there but it gets uncomfortable sometimes so i change fingers. Like my fingers needs a rest  changing fingers resolves that. .   They suggest to sleep with the sizer over night.  When i sized the ring, the sizer i chose for the first night would barely come off in the morning. i think i went up 2 sizes to size 11.  i am over weight and don't wear rings normally.  The fitbit started recording oxygen levels but wont let you see it unless you pay. that is greedy to me  left a bad taste for fitbit.  they could show me something but don‚Äôt. It makes the fitbit ‚Äòout‚Äô for me.  i chose Oura because of that.  I wish i knew how accurate it is overall."
5,QQQQQZÓå®,"My husband passed away a little over a year ago and my sleep has been very sporadic. I often have insomnia.  I am trying very hard to get back  into a healthy sleep pattern. I have taken over his company and travel a week - 10 days out of the month in different time zones.  That, coupled with grief hasn‚Äôt been helpful for sleep. The Oura rings helps me to understand my sleep patterns.  The first thing I do is check my sleep in the am.  I‚Äôm still not falling asleep when I should every night, but I am making a point to get at least 7 hours sleep. I love how it tells me about rem sleep and deep sleep and how many calories I burn during the day.  It truly makes me more mindful.  I even add my meditations in and I can see how my breath slows and my heart beat slow.  Just an all around game changer."
2,Zvirani,"When I first got my Oura Ring I was beyond ecstatic about it. I loved the way it looked and more importantly started becoming obsessed with the data. Friends would ask me do you like your Oura ring and my response was yes, but ask me in a month, I want to see what the value is without the membership.  After pausing my subscription to see what the difference is, I‚Äôm confidently able to say to people, if you feel confident you want to spend money on the subscription, then this is for you otherwise don‚Äôt spend your money here. I‚Äôm surprised that Oura thinks the best model is only the 3 basic scores without a subscription. In principle, the subscription is less than $100 / yr but we are now in an age where companies believe that we have to scrape every last dollar from the consumer.  I‚Äôd love to be an ambassador for Oura but given you only get the 3 basic scores without a subscription, I simply can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs too bare bones and makes you feel as if the organization is just money hungry."
2,Edu-Ari,"Putting aside the poor connectivity of the device (two days owned), the app is surprisingly limited for being the ‚Äúestablished‚Äù and longest existing ring wearable on the market.  /‚Äî-Deets‚Äî-/  The only widget the app offers are on sleep. Making it so that I have to UNLOCK my phone, FIND the app, then DIG out stats from their SUB-menus. If mental wellness really is a goal, they‚Äôd offer us the ability to not have to engage with our phones beyond a glance.   The app‚Äôs landing page is filled with irrelevant how-to‚Äôs that CANNOT be swiped away or closed. Worse is that you can‚Äôt even organize the position of tiles, or place stats from sub menus on the home page.   Upon set up, I‚Äôm asked the ‚Äúgender I was born as‚Äù, but still pushed female centric features. This isn‚Äôt some anti-female comment, this is coming from myself as a developer. If you‚Äôve gathered information about me upon set up, why not use that to suppress irrelevant features? Best I can tell, it‚Äôs throwing every content tile they have available, attaching a ‚Äúsoothing‚Äù banner and fluff content just to present itself as a completed/feature-rich app.   Ultimately, I‚Äôm likely returning and canceling plans to buy one for my partner and mom. The device‚Äôs connection issues and the app‚Äôs lack of growth (which I‚Äôd be paying for yearly?!) only make the case to keep on keeping with a watch. Or until Apple releases their own non-watch wearable or I leap back to Samsung."
1,Ragpie83,"If you use a keyboard all day for work, don‚Äôt expect the Oura ring to accurately track your activity. My steps are being doubled every day and the culprit is using the computer for work.  Spoke with their customer service rep, Ross, and experienced possibly the worst level of service I have ever come across.  First he ignored my questions in my first two emails and simply sent me cut and paste responses from their help Center. Then, after acknowledging that they‚Äôre aware of the issue, his solution was for me to take off the ring while I‚Äôm working. Not sure what I paid $400 plus an ongoing subscription for if I can‚Äôt wear it 8-10 hours per day while working. After I asked for a refund he quickly tried to backtrack and said he would have the product team ‚Äúlook into it‚Äù, then he stopped replying to me and is now simply ignoring my emails. Have gone through their website for a refund instead.   Will be reverting to an Apple Watch. Better product. Better customer service. More accuracy."
5,Masterthegameoflife,"I‚Äôve been a customer since the generation 1 ring.  The amount I‚Äôve learned through the use of this ring has been incredible, along with the accountability it creates to make changes in life.  Looking at my data over the past 6 years is fascinating, I have no idea how I was coping with my poor sleep quality before purchasing this ring and enacting changes in my life based on the feedback.  I just want to thank the ≈åURA team for making such an incredible product, and for their excellent customer service over the years.  I am a bit confused by some of the reviews mentioning bad customer service because they‚Äôve always been incredibly responsive to me and have replaced 3 rings for me in the past through warranty, in a very quick and no cost manner.  Thank you team ≈åURA!"
3,Arj423,"I bought this to track sleep, which it does well, but there are a lot of flaws. 1) the graphs are excessively complicated ( who uses a stacked bar graph??) and I always feel like I‚Äôm being inundated with data.2) it doesn‚Äôt do a good job detecting naps and you also can‚Äôt edit naps 3) it shows you sleep and movement throughout the night but you can‚Äôt drag your finger across the timeline to see at what point in the night you had movement 4) it tends to adjust your sleep score based on length of sleep rather than quality of sleep I.e. I had a night of terrible sleep but because I slept for 8+ hours I had nearly a perfect sleep score. 5) It shows your average blood oxygen throughout the night instead of a bar graph or line graph that shows how it varies throughout the night. I could go on but I won‚Äôt - honestly the pillow app is better, much more accurate, and easier to digest"
2,antititus,"After a week with the ≈åura, I'm unfortunately relegating it to the ""fun trinket"" bin. The app is buggy as heck. On my second day, both entries in the date picker were labeled ""Today."" Different screens tell me I went to bed at different times for the same night. The silliest bug though is a line chart showing my ""readiness"" score. The chart shows my most recent score as below average, but the text congratulates me on being above average. If this company can't even figure out which way their inequalities are pointing, why would I trust them with a more complex task like analyzing my sleep? I tried writing support, but they gave a canned ""try reinstalling"" reply. It might work, but since the install is only a week old, it's pretty bad if it does. My guess, though, is they're just trying to put up a hurdle before spending any time investigating, a hallmark of lower-tier software companies. Wish this thing were better, it sure seems like a promising idea!"
5,M.Allison.,"Of all the investments i‚Äôve made in my health this year, my Oura ring is by far the best one. I‚Äôd wanted one for a little over a year, and really established a routine this year so I decided I‚Äôd earned the splurge and if I didn‚Äôt like it in the first few weeks it‚Äôs returnable within 30 days. Not once did returning my Oura cross my mind. Waking up and looking at my sleep stats and readiness makes me excited to get out of bed each morning, and monitoring my days activity allows me to make smart choices in my body autonomy. Thank you Oura for the tool to connect so expertly to my body. I‚Äôm so grateful for this science and it‚Äôs accessibility to college students like myself. I would recommend investing in an Oura ring any day if you want accurate, timely, and encouraging statistics about your body."
2,Niki860,"I switched from FitBit to Oura about a year ago. After +-1 year, my Oura has to be charged every 3 days. It lasted 7 days for the first few months and quickly faded. I don‚Äôt expect it to last much longer. I‚Äôll probably go back to FitBit soon. I got much better insights from my Fitbit, though it was too bulky and intrusive for my taste (my reason for the switch). I‚Äôd recommend the Oura if all you‚Äôre concerned with is sleep analysis. But everything else is subpar compared to FitBit. You can‚Äôt get real-time anything from Oura. You have to stop and take a ‚Äúmoment‚Äù to get any real-time data. My last FitBit basically told me I was pregnant before a pregnancy test came up positive (4 years ago). I can‚Äôt even track my cycle with the Oura. And now that they‚Äôve jumped on the subscription bandwagon‚Ä¶im completely over it. I spent $300 on this ring‚Ä¶my FitBit was 1/3 the price and lasted 3+ times longer with better insights. my final thoughts, Oura is not worth it if you want to keep track of your stats."
3,Mamakachama,"Every time you update your iPhone OR get a new iPhone it is a TOTAL NIGHTMARE with your Oura ring. I‚Äôve gone through this ordeal TWICE now and it‚Äôs exactly the same thing whether updating my iPhone or trying to get the ring to connect with a new iPhone. I‚Äôve deleted the App and re-installed it; turned off the phone and turned it back on; turned off BlueTooth and turned it back on; gone through the entire Factory Reset process; banged the ring on the counter while in the charging port (as described by Oura Customer Service Rep), etc etc etc!!! Although the Customer Service Rep was very patient, after about 15-20 emails back and forth trouble-shooting I was about to call it QUITS with Oura. SOOOOOOOOO frustrating!!! I FINALLY got the ring to collect data again after my last iPhone software update but now with a brand new iPhone here we go again!! It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard!"
2,Sleepless in the Springs,"I purchased this device hoping to better understand my sleep cycle and improve my sleep.  Even though it fits well and has good data capture, it consistently fails to detect that I am awake when it thinks I‚Äôm asleep.  It takes me at least 30 minutes to fall asleep, and it doesn‚Äôt even recognize I‚Äôm in bed trying to fall asleep for the first 10 minutes, then reports I fell asleep in less than 5 minutes!  Oh I wish!  I wake up several times during the night and it thinks I‚Äôm in light or deep sleep - even for up to 2 hours at a time.  I‚Äôve even gone to the bathroom at night and it didn‚Äôt think I woke up at all.  I don‚Äôt move around much while sleeping, and it‚Äôs correct about that.  It‚Äôs also inaccurate with reporting I‚Äôm napping while I‚Äôm standing up reading on my phone or sitting reading at my desk. I wish I could give it feedback and it could learn my signals so it would be more accurate.  The exercise data seems accurate, but sleep and readiness are highly inaccurate for me."
3,GTRacer69,"Don‚Äôt want to be active today but still want credit and keep your step count looking good - just sit ride/drive in car for a few hours. After a 3 hour car ride I was surprised to see I had accumulated 1000s of steps. I wrote to Oura and Trevor replied ‚ÄúWe have witnessed a small number of cases involving excess activity reporting. As a workaround to this issue, simply place the ring in your pocket when partaking in activities that involve excess motion, such as motorcycling or mowing the lawn.‚Äù I‚Äôm sitting in a car! Oura won‚Äôt allow the user to edit step count. I can‚Äôt adjust any data points to account for this. Oura is building algorithms off of junk data and they don‚Äôt care to allow the user to help correct the flawed data. And. I tried the pocket and it doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, it just counts a few less steps at a lower intensity. Something tells me this canned reply isn‚Äôt limited to ‚Äúa small number of cases‚Äù only involving excessive motion."
3,AllTheNicknamesAreTaken121,"The app overall works well, so my lower rating isn‚Äôt due to any app errors like bugs or crashing.  However, I find the app to not be intuitive. I find it confusing to find the information I‚Äôm looking for. I also found it confusing how some items wouldn‚Äôt show up until after a certain period of time when you first got the ring. But it‚Äôs not consistent because, for example, you can see the cycle data but it will say ‚Äú# more nights still needed.‚Äù  Even though I have access to the items now (I think‚ÄîI‚Äôm not completely confident in this) the items seem to kind-of pop up on the main menu but then sometimes not. And then I feel like I have to tap around manically to try to find what I‚Äôm looking for.   Lastly, the data in the charts are frustrating to me when I can‚Äôt see the specific numbers for the data points. For most charts, it‚Äôs just an image with the x and y axis labeled and a chart illustration of the data.  What would make the app better for me: - an easily comprehensible library of the data I can access (and please no chunking items by category unless the categories are confirmed to be intuitive) - showing all the data available at once, even if you have to add the ‚Äú# more nights/days needed‚Äù label - adding the ability to see the specific data for all the charts."
3,cammy cam,"I had high hopes, but it has become more a part of my wardrobe than my training. You could definitely find a cheaper ring with the same looks. Due to its lack of customization, I‚Äôm not sure it has a use. As someone that does moderate intensity cardio for at least 7-10 hours a week, strength training for 7-10 hours/week, and about 3 hours a week of cardio, I require very specific customization. The system sometimes tells me I need to lay low and burn only 250 calories on a day where I have a 20 mile run planned, which I‚Äôve trained and slept and eaten to be ready for. I rarely sleep more than 6 hours, which the system thinks is abhorrently low. Yet if I get the amount of sleep it recommends, I feel groggy and crappy and it effects my training, meditation and stress levels. When/if they begin to allow for customizable settings, this could be really cool. Until then it‚Äôs more templatized than the US public school system, ie not very useful."
1,peterchicago,"I initially was excited about this product, as I was trying to improve my sleep. In the beginning, my ring would randomly disconnect from my iPhone, even though I have full charge, and now I can‚Äôt even connect. I‚Äôve tried the troubleshooting steps, I‚Äôve tried contact customer support, and the responses have been poor, not helpful, and also takes way too long. For a $300 ring, that is inexcusable. In spite of this, I have asked and pleaded with the Oura support team to at least send me a replacement ring, showing evidence of the disconnect, and following and confirming their steps. THERE IS NOTHING PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH MY RING. The app and the ring simply REFUSE to connect and the data is not in sync. Now, the support team is not allowing me to return the ring or receive a replacement ring. I am not being unreasonable and am pleading, please resolve this situation by providing a new ring, or allowing me to return this ring for a refund. I work hard for the products I buy, and this is not fair treatment."
4,99st,"I‚Äôve had my Oura ring for a few weeks now and it‚Äôs really starting to sync with my body! It‚Äôs a great product! The best wearable I‚Äôve used so far!  My biggest problem though is that it doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize certain workouts as well as others. For example, I do a lot of weightlifting and I also teach rowing classes. It measures my heart rate accurately but it doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a ‚Äúworkout‚Äù. If I go for a 20 minute walk, it will recognize that, but it really only seems to give you ‚Äúcredit‚Äù for your activity if your arms are moving in a walking pace.   I know I can manually enter a workout myself, but there is no weightlifting option. WHY!!??  I work WAY harder lifting weights than I do going for a walk but there‚Äôs no real way to track it. Please take this into consideration next software update!"
1,JohnDoeSan,"Update:  Still no response from Oura customer service. I have decided not to upgrade to Oura 3. Its sleep stats have always been pretty inaccurate anyway, why should I reward such a terrible company with my money?  And the app has gotten even worse recently. Inaccurate sleep tracking aside, I have always been able to import (before midnight) exercise data from Apple Watch into the Oura app without any problem. Today this import function suddenly stopped working. Even though I have imported 400 calories of (afternoon) exercise into the Oura app, it said I only did 160 calories of exercise. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't also tracking my data with a spreadsheet. What a piece of crap!  Terrible sleep tracking, inability to record exercise after midnight, no longer functional (before-midnight) Apple Watch exercise imports, literally zero customer support, greedy subscription bait-and-switch... I hope Oura goes bankrupt very soon. Can't wait to see a better, ethical company kill it off.  Sort the App Store reviews by ""recent"" to see for yourself what the truth is.  ps. Oura, no need to tell me to contact your customer service, because it doesn't exist.  Original review from November 2021:  Emailed them a simple question and still no response after almost 2 weeks. And they want people to start paying them a subscription fee for simple, basic features that have always came included with the ring lol"
2,Mom4tnt,"I purchased this when it first came out and loved it. The first update created battery issues so they replaced it for me. Then another update created connectivity problems, again they replaced it for me. Now the last update has the battery lasting less than 2 days, and the sleep as well as activity measurements are no longer accurate. I find it reading that I‚Äôm asleep when I‚Äôm lying down reading, or stating that no calories were burned while I‚Äôm walking. After reading all the issues with newer generations and the required subscription for getting all the information I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth getting a new one. I‚Äôm really disappointed in the direction they have pushed this product. I realize more data tracked means you are getting better quality health information but if it isn‚Äôt all working as it should be, don‚Äôt release it. It‚Äôs really frustrating that it‚Äôs no longer useful."
5,LWalker187,"I got the Oura ring to pair with the Natural Cycles app for hormone free birth control and am absolutely loving it. It seems so rare that a tech device works completely seamlessly but I have been very surprised at the fact that there was been no glitch. Each day my Oura app automatically syncs with my Natural Cycles app and I get insightful, helpful, and most importantly accurate information about my cycle without having to do or remember a single thing. Very grateful for this integration. Additionally, I am really enjoying learning more about what kinds of activities provide restorative time. I held of buying this for a long time because I did not think the information was really worth the price, but I definitely have been proven wrong and love the flawless app and functional ring."
5,NASH Productions,"I have owned my Oura ring for about a year now. The information it gives and reads as it analysis your sleep is incredible. Recently my husband got Covid and exposed my daughter to it. For 4 days I was fine showing no symptoms of having the virus. On the 5th day, my readings from Oura started to show that my temperature was elevated and my HRV balance was off as well as my resting heart rate was up. It continued to show negative reads, and on the 7th day I got tested and was positive. I told the doctor that my ring as well as the obvious of feeling horrible on that 5th day that prompted me to go get tested. The doctor said my heart rate was elevated because it‚Äôs working hard because my body is fighting the virus, and I told her yes I know because my ring alerted me. This ring could actually save your life!"
5,Minnispanny,"I‚Äôve worn an Oura ring from the very beginning. Within a year my husband and children were also wearing Ouras. During Covid we took part in a study through UCSF which looked at the ring predicting Covid.  As the science has improved we‚Äôve updated our rings and actually follow each others health through Circles. The information this wearable technology has provided me and my family is invaluable. From HRV to oxygenation to time asleep, deep and REM, temperature and so much more. It slaves seamlessly to my Apple Watch and allows you to add tags about your health to personalize your experience.  A great help to me has been learning about how alcohol or eating to close to bedtime and my circadian rhythm affects the quality of my sleep. Honestly I think everyone should wear one."
5,Aarwen19,Sleep tracking has so many bugs! Initially I was excited to get this ring as a gift and it seemed like a good idea to have more data on my wellness. As a new mom my sleep pattern is slightly different and need help tracking how much rest and recovery time I was getting. It does not track sleep well if you are not sleeping 6 hours at a stretch. Everything is a nap in the app and there is no detail on sleep quality in a nap. Even when I have slept through the night it only catches a few hours of initial sleep with data missing frequently. Every other day even if you wear the ring correctly overnight you get no data quoting ‚Äòseems like you forgot to wear the ring‚Äô! Don‚Äôt need faulty data in an already sleep deprived world. Save your money for Apple Watch or other better health monitoring gadgets.
1,LT_Ahhsum,"EDIT: Thanks developer for the response but you‚Äôre a couple months too late. Glad someone is taking action all the same. Back in December I finally got a response from the warranty department after I threatened to take action through my state attorney general, and successfully returned my ring for a refund. Just checked the app and seems to be working now even though I no longer have the ring and have deleted my account. Leaving my review below the same because it was such a miserable support experience that took months to resolve.   App crashes instantly on open. iOS 16, iPhone 13 Pro, now version 4.7.9 of app. Can‚Äôt use ring without app. ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù has been beyond useless. Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre reading this it‚Äôs probably too late; you likely already blew 400 bucks on the ring. Hopefully you can get your money back, because I sure can‚Äôt! This is among the most miserable customer service experiences I‚Äôve had in my entire life. I wish I could rate this 0 stars."
1,act7491,"After wasting at least an hour of my life trying to setup my new ring, i‚Äôm calling it. I‚Äôm returning my Ours ring and probably move on to a better product, like the Whoop band or something else. I‚Äôve tried contacting this company about assisting me, i‚Äôve tried using this virtual chat, to no avail. Even if i were to get it setup, theres no way I could feel confident in using this product with the troubles i‚Äôve experienced while attempting to set it up. When i try and set it up on my computer, the website wont verify my address, and i‚Äôve tried on multiple computers, in multiple locations. And its not like i‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere, i live in a very big city. Then when i try and set it up on my phone, I get to what i think is the very end to submi payment and that circle just keeps spinning and the page stays still with no further action. nothing happens, its like this site is stuck in a processing payment limbo for eternity and dragging me along with it. Goodbye oura, you blow."
2,mcanoe77,"I got the ring to compliment my Garmin Watch which I use for training, but to give me more information about my body temperature as I navigate pregnancy. I was really disappointed when I went to log a pregnancy and track my body temperature to find out that there was no setting to do this and I just felt completely ignored as a woman. My body was going through all these changes (as well as a loss), I was exhausted and although this was reflected in my readiness, I would have appreciated something that acknowledged I was pregnant.   I see you are now partnering with Natural Cycles so hopefully more information, but this comes with ANOTHER subscription of $99 (after a free trail). I spent $300 on the ring, a $7 a month subscription all to be told you can‚Äôt tell me the basic biological information as a female and instead have to be directed and pay for another app. Just disappointed all around, clearly your female clients aren‚Äôt a priority."
3,Abbeetime,"Originally gave this 5 stars. I have had my ring for 2 1/2 years. During that time it has given my invaluable data. I have had sleep issues and having the data gives me the opportunity to show the doctor exactly what is going on. It also helps me tweak what helps and what hurts my sleep (alcohol, desserts üò¢). I did have my first ring stop holding a charge after about a year, but the company was able to troubleshoot it on their end and sent me a new ring, no problem. Now my ring is starting to lose its charge again, so I was thinking of getting a new Gen 3 ring, because I have enjoyed having the ring so much.   HOWEVER, just found out that they are requiring a $5.99 membership per month to get all the data with the Gen 3 ring.  That‚Äôs an additional $72 a year! That‚Äôs not going to fly with me. Going have to find an alternative."
5,Piper's Human,"This is a really great product, and it allows users to stay on top of their activity, sleep, stress and now aspects of heart health. Please use AI to provide more insights around my data to guide me to better sleep and health longevity. (Ex) ‚ÄúDid you know, when you fall asleep during your recommended bedtime window that you typically experience 20% more deep sleep‚Äù. We also need ability to customize the home screen ‚ÄúToday Screen‚Äù to select which data shows. For example let me hide cards about stress management, ‚ÄúPin‚Äù readiness or sleep to the top of the screen or etc. Add workout programs to the explore tab to improve VO2 Max such as HIT training. Scan for AFIB in the background like the Apple Watch."
4,Julia A H,"I love my Oura ring and originally bought it to track my workouts, but the one major flaw that I really dislike that it only lets you ‚Äúrecord workout HR‚Äù for outdoor/indoor running, outdoor/indoor cycling, and walking. What about all of the other workout options? The only way to add a different type of workout, such as strength training, barre, etc. Is by adding it after the fact. It‚Äôs not constantly recording the HR like it would be if you selected the ‚Äúrecord workout HR‚Äù option. I wanted this ring to replace my Apple watch, but this is a huge turn off. On my watch, I can select my exact type of workout and it will constantly track HR until you end the workout. That isn‚Äôt possible for a majority of workouts on the Oura ring. I really hope this changes in a future app update!  ü§ûüò≠"
1,Veroito,"All I. asked Oura  (but please no AI) if anyone from oura  please call me or reach out to me and help me, bc I genuinely rely on Oura for seizures that had decreased immensely but I stop for lat two weeks bc the battery wouldn‚Äôt hold.  I can honestly say the oura ring since it was introduced to me with noom has beyond weight loss for me with its heart rate variations, sleep data and much more. I am aware it helps many other too, but that gran mal are extremely card to predict the best you ate the markets that according to what I learned from the first oura .   Unfortunately  your AI want alll your verification which I try but I am not getting any where.   I love. the Ouara  for the peace of mind it brings people like me when we you need a suuport system to help with that issues arrive with the oura ring,bc many people like myselI rely on the Oura for my life. I get seizures this Friday and  I wasn‚Äôt wearing the ring due to battery charges probably.  Please help loyal original tester from the beginning win , on second our ring."
2,BbP331,"The app is getting so much worse. My sleep score for the last few months has shown two totally different measurements for deep sleep and REM sleep due to the new algorithm (only available to 3rd generation rings). The numbers shown up top will usually be twice as high as the ‚Äúnewer‚Äù measurements below. So I‚Äôll get a good sleep score saying I got 2.5 hours of deep sleep but then I scroll down and it tell me I only got 1.25 hrs. So what number do I believe??? if the new algorithm is better, then I have I just been getting a lot more sleep than I think I have for the last three years I‚Äôve had oura ring? Was their algo before that insanely inaccurate?   Then the other issue is it missing recording a lot of my sleep. Half the time if I wake up for a little during the night and fall back asleep, it will never record the second half of my sleep (even if it‚Äôs hours long) and it also miss half of my naps."
5,Adams1brostar,"Amazing product, it‚Äôs worked flawlessly for me for the last fee years. Love the form factor since I can wear my ring and use my Apple Watch simultaneously. I am a medical student and use it to track my sleep and activity to make sure I stay active and take care of myself. Highly recommended for anyone looking to improve sleep and overall performance as you can see what‚Äôs working for you and what‚Äôs not.   One suggestion for the oura team: make the battery notification appear a few hours before bed, or better yet let me customize when I get the notification. I have do not disturb turn on at 9pm and the notification to charge my ring doesn‚Äôt come, so I‚Äôve been left without my daily readiness score quite a few times."
1,nicholas.selman,"1.5 years into owning a Gen 3 ring. I used to love this thing, and told everyone about it. I was a huge advocate for the Oura brand. Recently, though, the updates to the ring software crush battery life. I can get maximum 2 normal nights on a charge. If I get 6ish hours of sleep per night, maybe that extends to 3 nights on a charge *just barely*. By the way, Oura will tell you that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is 2 nights on a charge, or better. I used to get 4-5 easily before the latest firmware update. What‚Äôs worse, in my back-and-forths with Support, they blame me. They tell me that various features of the ring consume more battery life, and that a longer night of sleep can also consume more battery life. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve done absolutely 0 to change my habits with the ring other than update to the latest firmware. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed that there‚Äôs been no acknowledgment or help to remediate these issues. I‚Äôll be moving on from my Oura when this current billing cycle concludes."
5,ed cheung,"WOW!  Been using my Oura ring for 2 months now. This tiny thing is amazing. I was very skeptical at first because I have tried multiple different sleep monitors out there. This one really is the best.  I am a Hospital Physcian who is ‚Äúbio hacking‚Äù myself to slow / reverse aging. Sleep is the elusive 4th part of it (along with exercise, eating and mind).   This tiny ring is comfortable and packed with amazing sensors and tech. It not only accurately measures sleep time but also the phases of sleep. It is honestly better than many sleep reports I see at professional sleep labs.  FYI, I see a lot of patients with sleep apnea and they get sent for sleep studies all the time.   However, the true key and benefit I am getting from my own sleep data is not only the quality of sleep, but the Heart Rate Variability.  It really is a predictive measure to gage my body and mind. It helps me be more in tune with myself and is predictive of the following few days if I do not take care of myself.   Absolutely recommend this to everyone who is wanting to improve the quality of their life. HOWEVER, you want to improve yourselves AND be in tune with your own body to bet full benefits."
3,Gabie Allocca,"I forget how long the ""trial period"" is, but I got the ring originally because I thought I may be having heart problems and this could help me monitor without having to wear a watch.  I do like seeing how much I slept each night too, to plan for the next day and whether I need to squeeze in a nap or not.  My trial period ended not too long ago though, and I haven't made any changes but I've noticed before the ring would last about a week or so without having to charge. Then I chose not to pay the monthly subscription at the end of the trial period to have the ""extra stuff"", and it seems that now my battery lasts about two days at a time.... ü§î At this rate I don't really see the point in even keeping the ring, if I have to pay monthly to not have it die every two days, when I'm used to it lasting about a week..."
5,MSUBeast37,"As someone who is into health and fitness I have purchased many health gadgets.  8 sleep, Ooler, Apple Watch, Whoop, Muse. Oura is by far the most informative of all of them.  As an early adopter I have also seen the company grow and Oura provide more health metrics.  Every new feature is a new insight into how my body is performing.  When my ring has malfunctioned or no longer holds a charge their customer service immediately addresses and a new ring is shipped within days.  I have been so impressed that I have purchased Oura rings for all my employees along with my parents and siblings.  If you are wanting to see how your body is performing at rest don‚Äôt waste your time on any other device.  Do yourself a favor and buy an Oura ring."
5,DRE23,"This app and product rocks! Been using the Oura ring for 3 years now. The ring is incredibly durable and it‚Äôs low enough profile for me to not even notice I‚Äôm wearing it.  Also the support team is amazing. My ring battery ran down after about a year and a half and they sent me a brand new one with speedy response and great customer service.  I also host a health, fitness and wellness podcast and I recommend my listeners get the Oura ring on almost every other episode, I‚Äôm even wearing the ring front and center in my podcast cover photo (Livin‚Äô the Dream Podcast). The app stores all the years worth of data and gives you trends of your activity, sleep, recovery, etc.. can‚Äôt speak highly enough of team Oura! üíØ"
2,UAM Weevil,"This is a scam plain and simple. I bought this ring for the health information it provided. Sleep info, body temp, etc now with this asinine monthly fee if I don‚Äôt subscribe I can‚Äôt get the information I paid $300 for?!?  This is a classic bait and switch!!!  The ring was great, so great in fact I got one for my wife too. It was nice to see sleep patterns, heart rate and other important health information. But now Oura has made the ring useless unless you pay the monthly fee. Oura does offer meditation and breathing exercises and stuff like that if you pay the monthly fee but thaT IS NOT what I got the ring for. So why should I not have my personal health information b/c you want to offer all these other items? A suggestion to Oura: give us back our health information and charge the people who want to use the other items like meditation and all that jazz that I am not interested in."
3,dallas61,Oura used to be a great product. After the latest update the app no longer tracks outdoor activity. It recognizes that it happens but what used to be automatic as recently as 5 days ago no longer works and I‚Äôm getting instructions that are basic from support effectively blaming me as the customer for why it isn‚Äôt working. I have been using the Oura for almost 4 years and I know how it works and all the tricks to try when it isn‚Äôt working. The latest app update broke it and previous app updates have made the heart rate monitoring less stable. It is still decent for sleep monitoring but I don‚Äôt think it is worth it as an overall tracker any longer. The latest update is that even though it appeared with the last update engineering can‚Äôt do anything about it. This gets worse with every update.
5,AJDiVo,"I‚Äôve never worn a ring before so I was hesitant to wear/buy. How could this little device provide me any insight that my other wearables don‚Äôt? The accuracy is unprecedented and the minimalistic form factor is amazing. It‚Äôs completely unobtrusive to my daily activities and provides a wealth of health data that I couldn‚Äôt imagine or get from another wearable.   The sleep algorithm is just phenomenal, and the granular details Oura provides in the app across sleep, readiness, activity, scores, and health trends is just mind boggling. Oura provides so much more detail into your physiology than the ‚Äú3‚Äù scores everyone is familiar with.   Oura integrates and is able to draw data (if you give it permission) from your other wearables which provides a near 360¬∞ view of your overall health and wellness. I cannot recommend this product enough.   If you‚Äôve never been a ring guy (like me) and we‚Äôre hesitant because of that aspect - I can assure you that this little device that fits around your finger is so worth the time it takes to get used to the fact that you‚Äôve become a ring person that you‚Äôll never want to take it off."
1,Borders Baby,"Loved my Oura ring so much I opted to upgrade to the Gen 3. I‚Äôd love to give a review for the Gen 3 but I cannot get the Firmware to update therefore it is unusable. I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING suggested on their website and have tried to contact their customer service on 3 different occasions over the past 3 weeks - no response. I‚Äôm hoping someone might respond to this review. My next step is to ask for a refund or elevate this complaint. Oura if you are reading this please help, I want to love your product again!  UPDATE:  28 days from initial request for help I finally heard back from Oura.  Customer Service 101 would have suggested they at least acknowledge their lack of contact.  It was apparent that Oura did not bother to ready my email - they provided the same troubleshooting instructions from their website.  If their APP has not updated in the past 4 weeks what difference will it make if I continue to try the same troubleshooting instructions?"
1,JBHorner,"Putting the company‚Äôs history aside, I‚Äôll focus on the app. Painful is the only word I can use. When it works, it works well. When it decides it‚Äôs not going to work any more, it‚Äôs a colossal pain to get things fixed.  Symptoms: Tap on the app to open, and it immediately exits (I presume it‚Äôs crashing‚Ä¶as not even a splash screen shows.). The only recourse at this point is to remove the app and then reinstall. Then it‚Äôs necessary to enter your email address again, then log in, and then PRAY that the app will find the ring that‚Äôs been working for months‚Ä¶notwithstanding the last time it forced you to go through this process.  Then, once it finds the ring it leads you through a series of questions for which it should already have answers. (It knows the ring‚Äôs serial number, and knows it‚Äôs registered to you‚Äîwhy is it necessary to go through the list of questions again?!)  The comes the synchronization. It usually works, but not always. The symptom of ‚Äúnot always‚Äù is akin to the spinning beach ball on a mac, or rotating circles in Windows. All you can do is wait‚Ä¶and wait‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶nothing.  Sadly, this is not a rare occurrence. I‚Äôve had this happen five times this year‚Äîacross two different iPhones. I do not have problems with other apps.  Having to go through this nonsense, particularly when it ties to poor error handling within their app, is nuts."
1,MurderNote,"Update: Without a subscription you get 3 scores and that‚Äôs it. You pay over $300 and then have to pay $5+taxes/month or you get useless information. After a recent update my battery wouldn‚Äôt last more than a day and a half. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why and in researching, found many others were having the same issue. You cannot opt out of allowing your ring data being used by the Oura company and whoever they share it with. I knew this so I never allowed my location to be used. After the update, it was turned on without my knowledge. I turned it off in the app then went into the settings on my iPhone and blocked it there too. Now my ring stays charged longer, but not as long as when I first got it. (Gen 3) I also cut off the subscription. This company‚Äôs behavior is too red flag-ish for me. Further, I get more info from my smart watch than this and I don‚Äôt pay any monthly fees and, I get to maintain my privacy."
5,ZeeArteest86,"The app itself is great, and my favorite part is that it starts syncing as soon as the app opens and shows the progress bar. This is way better than my old fitbit charge 5 which seemed to wait forever and sync the data whenever it felt like it which was really annoying.  The ring itself has been great with only a couple things I want in the next version to improve the experience‚Ä¶  For Oura Ring 4 I would love if the sensor bumps were smaller and all around the ring because I don‚Äôt like having to check throughout the day to make sure the ring hasn‚Äôt spun at all, since it has to be facing a certain direction for accurate heart rate readings. This is especially true when I wash my hands and the ring gets slippery, and it has created a habit of checking on it that I don‚Äôt like.  The other nitpick is how beefy the ring is. This is the most minor thing but I would love if it could be a little thinner.  Mainly though if I didn‚Äôt need to worry about the ring orientation it would free my attention up here and there throughout the day and take it from good to great imo."
4,Daisyy07,"I‚Äôve been using the Oura ring for about two years now. It‚Äôs helped me to monitor my sleeping habits among other areas of my health such as body temperature and readiness levels. Two feedback items that I wish programmers would address; 1- a notification to charge the ring. I‚Äôve encountered numerous instances where the battery shows half charged and then when I‚Äôm looking for sleep data the next morning, there isn‚Äôt any because there‚Äôs no charge. Inevitably the battery life subsides after you‚Äôve had the ring for some time. 2- the Oura seems to count certain activities twice. For ex. when I‚Äôm jogging, it will count my steps, and when I log the jog as an activity, it will count it twice, doubling the activity numbers which is not accurate."
1,Cydnew,"My ring and app were working perfectly, until less than two weeks ago. I loved being able to see the variables indicating when my body was more stressed than normal. As someone with chronic health issues, catching a problem while it is small is a big deal and helps me avoid bigger problems.   Two weeks ago though, I could no longer edit my sleep data, even within the three day limit. The sliders show, but are grayed out. I updated my app thinking it would help. After the update, my ring no longer syncs at all until it is on the charger. Once I put it on the charger, no sleep data syncs though some daily data is recorded.  Then, the battery charge drops to zero despite previously having 40-60%. It makes no sense.  I would have assumed it was a battery issue, except it was fine until the update.  Regardless, the ring is useless if it doesn‚Äôt record the sleep data."
1,KathyH007,"This app worked great for me for several years. I lost the ability to log in a week ago (Dec27). It won‚Äôt even open to a login splash screen.  Have been waiting for a reply from Support since then. The ring is great. Company processes are not for fulfillment or support. At this point, my ring is nothing more than a ring.  Update Jan 2, 2020 - Hey developers, thanks for making a ridiculously obvious suggestion because that‚Äôs just what I needed to hear after waiting (now) 7d and counting. Duh. I‚Äôve done that several times per day while I wait for contact from Support. It doesn‚Äôt work. Meanwhile, you‚Äôre wasting valuable time addressing well-earned criticisms here in reviews rather then focusing on providing actual support or doing dev ‚Äî because reviews are visible to potential users. And you‚Äôre experiencing high support volumes because your app IS NOT working and hasn‚Äôt been for at least a week, rendering the ring useless until it once again does."
2,Hale the Rose,"The new layout where we cannot switch between days easily is super neurodivergent unfriendly; the change in navigation is not easy to navigate for folks who spent a long time using the other interface; please give us an option to accept beta testing before you release updates with changes this major- I want my old interface back üòî Before I could change the day and see all the data for that day in one block. Now I have to go to a different section, and scroll to that date, back and forth individually for each section to track my own trends‚Ä¶. If I want to look at February of 2023 it‚Äôs really inconvenient to do this, and frustrating to the point of not wanting to use the app. Please, I really like this ironic and would be very sad to feel like I wasted my investment. Thank you for your understanding."
2,T.S.P,"The Oura ring and app have several issues that limit its usefulness. 1. If I spend any amount of time sitting quietly either before bedtime or when I get up in the morning, it counts that as sleep. Sometimes, after I have corrected that, it reverts and I don't notice so there are these anomalous and incorrect nights of 10-12 hours of sleep in my history. Therefore, the longer term (weekly or seasonal) analyses aren't very accurate. 2. I need to remove the ring when I mow the lawn or drive long distance, otherwise it counts that as a fairly vigorous or extended workout with no way to correct. Once again invalidating any long term analysis and also the readiness score. 3. The battery only began at around 4 days (not 7 as claimed) and soon was down to 1-2 days. The ring was still under warrenty and was replaced, but when the new ring developed the same short time span I was told the warranty (for the replacement ring) ended at the timeframe for the original ring. So, I charge it every day, which the instructions recommend so I guess they know the battery is quite limited, but like to pretend you're going to get a week at a time.  I really only use it to see my hrv when meditating. Even the nighttime hrv is in doubt due to above mentioned inaccuracy gauging when I am asleep."
1,Ysa Farias,"A bunch of friends and I bought the Oura ring at the same time. Most have had a battery fail at a bit over two years. It wasn‚Äôt clear until the warranty expired and even though they acknowledge the battery is defective they have only replaced one persons ring at no charge. I‚Äôm sorry, but if you‚Äôre using parts which you subsequently learn are defective, shouldn‚Äôt you replace all of those defective rings? Buyer beware, this company does not stand behind their product. Buy something else. So, you lose data because what looked like enough charge was not. And, your screen is taken over by constant reminders to buy the new ring. You can‚Äôt dismiss it once you‚Äôve read it the first time or the hundredth. I get we all want latest tech but in an effort to dial back consumption and to maybe support climate change efforts, couldn‚Äôt they do a better job than this? My two cents."
5,atk0007,"I hardly ever write reviews but I just had to for this app!  I‚Äôm blown away by the quality of the ring and app. I am an Apple fanboy but this ring blows the watches tracking out of the water. While I still love my watch more for exercise, this ring is the leader in healthy lifestyle tracking. For those that are complaining about a subscription, I don‚Äôt mind it at all. It‚Äôs well worth it. The meditation at the end of the evening is well worth the cost alone. The background music combined with the meditation and voices is perfect. I can‚Äôt wait to keep using this as I start with making my sleep better and changing my lifestyle for the better. Thank you Oura!"
2,WordGirl8602190,"I really like the ring. It‚Äôs nice to not have yet another wrist tracker to wear and I find it‚Äôs more accurate that my Apple Watch. I love the longer battery life, ability to wear it in water, while sleeping, it‚Äôs great. However, the ring itself is expensive, and then you have to pay an incredibly expensive fee for the app. Now, I‚Äôm still in an extended free trial, so I‚Äôm using it, but the info syncs to Health, which I‚Äôm not sure will still happen once my free trial ends. Although, the info isn‚Äôt always syncing accurately. Only a third of my steps yesterday registered in Health. I haven‚Äôt mastered the insights of the app like others, and I‚Äôm going to try in my last couple months of the trial, but I‚Äôll likely end my trial before I have to pay for it. Which is a shame, because it seems like I‚Äôll have an expensive and useless ring without it."
3,ras68,"The ring provides decent data and app is helpful, but not worth the $ without promised updates. Many of us bought Gen3 rings on the promise of better sleep algorithm, SPO2, etc early 2022‚Ä¶and we‚Äôre still waiting. App shows good data, but app lacks expected learning algorithm. With data it‚Äôs collecting over time and tags users are imputing, the app should provide personalized  recommendations, not general static ones. I.e, don‚Äôt keep telling me to not workout or eat late, when I‚Äôm already doing that. If my tags show work stress or medication, recommendations should be personalized based on user input and trends. I can get general recommendations elsewhere, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm paying for. And users will be furious if asked to pay for subscription without necessary app improvements."
5,Dr K Sawyer,"I purchased my Oura Ring back in 2018 in a size that would fit both my finger and my husband‚Äôs, so that we could switch it out to whoever needs it the most.   It‚Äôs been a very accurate companion, and I secretly love the fact that it gives me steps for knitting. I try to remember to take it off before I start, but not always.   It has helped calm my nerves during Covid times as I could always look at my overnight temperature to see if anything might be going on.   It also help me convince my doctors that my knee was infected after a knee replacement, when my overnight temperature spiked for several weeks.   And most recently after a bout of the flu followed by a sinus infection, when the overnight temp went up again for five nights in a row, I knew I was fighting something else. It help me to find a blistery looking bump that ended up being a staff infection likely connected to history of significant antibiotic use, and I was able to go get a treated yesterday. So glad I have my Oura!   Now, if it could just read my aura and adjust my chakras, I‚Äôd never be sick! (Feature request?!)"
2,bjsk6684,The interface is really amateurish and antiquated.  It should allow more precision and detail.  Graphs are too generalized and data is vague and not able to be viewed with enough accuracy and precision.  Ring battery was good out of the box - about 5-6 days without using too many features.   18 months later I barely get 3 days.  It always shuts off in the middle of the night and then doesn‚Äôt record anything for that night.  I don‚Äôt receive notifications that the battery will expire until it‚Äôs too late.   After 18 months I‚Äôm cancelling the subscription. I‚Äôll wait until a new generation with improvements and better interface comes out - also need a better battery or battery level notification system - like a text message telling me it‚Äôs time to charge the ring. Surely that‚Äôs an easy fix?
5,Alextricity42,"I‚Äôm really excited about my new Oura ring! I just got it a little under a week ago and I am already pumped about reaching activity goals as well as achieving the optimal sleep goals. It‚Äôs comfortable, aesthetic, and stays charged way longer than any other tech I own. It charges very quickly too. I‚Äôm telling everyone I know about mine! It‚Äôs been a product on my radar for quite some time. Some possible improvements: I would like to see my oura ring have automatic uploads of data without opening the app. New info from the ring only shows up as you refresh the app therefore new notifications only appear when you check it.  Better tracking of my workouts. It‚Äôs pretty good at detecting general time frames for workouts you performed but sometimes I am having to add the tags myself as it didn‚Äôt show up automatically that I worked out. I have to say the Apple Watch takes the cake on the workouts this far.  All in all. I love this product so far and I would recommend to anyone looking to improve their health or become more aware of their overall fitness.  Thanks!"
5,Hippi-Kat,"The Oura ring really surpassed my expectations. I thought at most, that it would be a solid tracker that could you some enhancements to be great.  It was great right out of the box, and it performs sleep and step tracking really well. I honestly think the Sleep tracking is the best of the two because it is so incredible, but the activity tracker is very strong and surpasses the performance of health trackers I‚Äôve used in the past.  It is well maintained with software updates when necessary, plus the user interface is very detailed yet easy to use and navigate.  The ring itself has a strong build and is comfortable. I‚Äôm an active person and haven‚Äôt had any issues with it. I do take it off when I lift weights or do push-ups/rowing, but that is just me being pre-cautious and not a reflection of the ring‚Äôs build.  Battery life is strong about 36-48 hours before a recharge by my estimation, and the charge time is quick.  I‚Äôve found customer service to be top notch from the Oura team, and I‚Äôm a very happy customer.  While isn‚Äôt cheap, the Oura ring is a great value that I think most people will be very pleased with."
2,Jess V. 28,"I absolutely HATE this new app update‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not user friendly at all and now I can‚Äôt just simply swipe to yesterday or other days I have to dig to try and find it. And for the meditations I have to search for those too. There tabs are too small and hard to see in dark mode, the timeline is upside down and the app almost never captures my live heart rate even if I‚Äôm siting perfectly still. They just made things VERY challenging to find. There‚Äôs too much. I understand things need to change and update, but when you update it to ‚Äúunusable‚Äù I wonder why I not only paid a million dollars for the ring (which I love - hence the second star, one star for the app itself) but I also pay $7/month for an app that I don‚Äôt even want to open because it just gives me anxiety. Please change the app back"
1,McShowoff,"I loved this ring but the app has been crashing for the last several months. I had to tweet at them to get an email address to reach customer service. The responses said they new it was an issue by there would be an update soon. They said please just keep deleting the app whenever it crashes and then reinstall it. I would do that and lose the data from the previous night and sometimes more. Not to mention the pain of having to set it up each and every time again.   I got an email saying the update is available and should do the trick, but I might have to delete and reinstall again if it crashes sometime after the update. I did that and it crashed and I reinstalled etc. That was six days ago. It just crashed again tonight. I‚Äôm done.   I have the 2nd generation ring I believe. I didn‚Äôt want to upgrade to the 3rd and have to pay a monthly fee for the additional features (and I don‚Äôt think there was a choice to keep the free plan I‚Äôm on if I upgraded). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related but it sure feels like what happens with a ton of tech companies when they get you in and then upgrade and change the terms and require you to upgrade in one way or another.   Very unhappy with this, especially when it was so promising."
5,Vval,"I am a Registered Nurse who works night shifts.  This ring and app‚Äôs guidance help me structure my day and night routine around my work schedule. I monitor my data daily and change my habits, my sleep routine and work shifts accordingly. It works! This functional piece of jewelry has a good potential to make you feel better and improve your health. You just need to pay attention to your numbers/scores, read their advice based on your data, learn about yourself (i.e. your sleep habits) and make a change! It is a game changer for me. Will it be a game changer for you? It all depends on how you use it. Great potential. Accurate sleep data. Thank you, developers! I‚Äôm staying for long! :)"
5,1appuser,"My ring was a birthday gift from my 3 adult kids. I love it. I love the feed back and the challenge do do better, like going to bed earlier for more sleep or going out and taking a walk to be healthier. I‚Äôve had a Fitbit for years, and actually still wear it out of habit, but I like the feedback from my ring and often feel it‚Äôs more accurate, and it‚Äôs more detailed. I also like some mornings it will tell me to take it easier that day if I‚Äôve had a big day the day before. It‚Äôs very validating to how I‚Äôm feeling as a senior. And some mornings it will tell me I can accomplish a big goal because all my numbers or something looked good. The ring offers good information and I love understanding more from its feedback through the app."
3,Guzzie2,"When the ring is working, the app is fine, but there is no reset and troubleshooting mechanism other than contacting customer support, which takes weeks to communicate with to solve problems.  I went through 5 levels of customer support trying to reset a defective 3rd gen ring, and you have to unpair the ring from the app and start over, but since the ring doesn‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt return to my data, it‚Äôs stuck in setup mode.  No option in the app to cancel the setup and get back to my old data. I‚Äôm on week 3 of troubleshooting a return and the service division said they‚Äôll forward me to another division and then went dark.  I never had trouble with the 2nd gen ring, but the 3rd gen one has been trouble."
5,KCL1234,I truly love my oura ring. The one thing I wish I would change is the ability to edit sleep stages - I have insomnia and my oura ring often picks up periods of time when I am lying in bed unable to sleep as ‚Äúlight sleep‚Äù when in fact I am awake in bed with a low heart rate and little movement. This really messes with how my sleep score maps to how I feel in the morning and because the cycles are in the middle of the night there is no way to edit the data (it only lets to modify your sleep and wake time). Seems small but I use the ring primarily to help manage my insomnia so this improvement would massively help !!!
4,ChelsTodd,"Great for tracking sleep but as an athlete my active energy is generally well above the daily goals set by Oura, which over time affects my readiness. I wish there was some level of customization like adding in training schedules so you can work your overall readiness around your workouts instead of having them compete.  That said, my sleep has improved since using the app quite dramatically so it‚Äôs been well worth it in that regard.  Only real downside is it doesn‚Äôt sync with many other apps besides Apple Health, which I‚Äôve had some issues with source data carrying back and forth correctly. Suggested apps that can sync into oura would be the Polar Apps for activity tracking when ring can‚Äôt be worn, and Strava which more accurately calculates distance."
2,Prpl haZe,"We‚Äôve had a couple of rings in the family and right about a year and a half they stop being able to stay charged for more than half a day, which makes them pretty useless.  I contacted customer service and they initially offered to send me a new ring but then ghosted me for a month, when I followed up, they eventually responded and a few weeks later I had a replacement ring.  By this time I had already canceled my monthly membership and come to find out if you‚Äôre not paying the data that you get as a worse than what you get from your phone. You can‚Äôt even look at yesterday‚Äòs history or add workout or any of the basic functionality you can do with a fitness tracker app on your phone.  So I appreciate them replacing the tiny, but I do not feel it is useful unless you‚Äôre committed to paying $6 a month or whatever they‚Äôre charging these days.   That said it is nice and unobtrusive and gives you heart rate data and some other interesting things that if you have health problems or are curious, can be fun to look at. But overall, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back because it wasn‚Äôt really driving any activity or giving me anything that I need to know."
5,Zaki Bin Uddin,"The sleep monitor is very accurate among all the other features. It can tell exactly when and if I wake up in the middle of the night. The charge lasts around a week which is very impressive. Very solid construction. The styling is simple and nobody can tell right off the bat that its loaded with hardware. The app has literally a ton of information to offer. This ring is not a gimmick. There is alot more to say. I don't write reviews but for a company like this, it's well deserved. I hope they continue to add more to what is already an incredible product. It's an elegant fashion statement that doubles as a health tracker that monitors your vitals so you can be more in tune with yourself. Great product. üëåüèº"
5,Tajmania,"Oura can help you on your journey to truly learning about you in areas we don‚Äôt often focus on.  I‚Äôve been monitoring since a little under 10 months consistently with Apple Watch and Apple fitness and biometric weight scale.    Once you understand how ours measures, and you will find yourself reducing the difficulty levels of activities because it surprisingly keeps getting better and you stay much more mindful about your overall health.   It‚Äôs truly a individual journey.  To each of you especially those that have felt the change, best of luck n keep going!"
2,SamManns,"Pros: Clunky at first, but easy to forget you‚Äôre wearing it since it‚Äôs lightweight.  With that out of the way, cons!  App is an over-designed news feed. You have to fish for your metrics amongst recommendations and articles and beta features. Most other fitness tracker apps let you customize your feed. Not here. Sure, there‚Äôs a tab at the bottom for most metrics, but if they‚Äôre not what your priority is, too bad.  Activity sensing is erratic at best. I work a desk job and it says I‚Äôm walking 12,000+ steps a day‚Ä¶ I am not. When I workout, I‚Äôll sweat aggressively for 40 mins and it labels the activity as ‚Äúhousework.‚Äù When I actually am doing chores, it calls that ‚Äúhousework‚Äù too.  Some metrics are totally abstract - The ring doesn‚Äôt actually READ your temperature, it only maps fluctuations on a bar chart. No concrete ‚Äú98.6¬∫F.‚Äù As someone who does fertility tracking, I was excited for this feature and found it‚Äôs useless in integration with other fertility apps, unless you pay for their preferred app partner.   The biggest con - value. I spent $400+ on a ring and lost all smartwatch screen features (alarms, texts, calls, emails). Now I have to spend an additional $6/month just to sees my own data? Yikes. Return to sender."
2,wasp604,"The app itself is OK, but the devs don't listen when users point out glaring design flaws. Custom tags are a necessity. The current tagging system is completely rubbish. So many useless tags (inconvenient & cluttered) and no way to tag things that really matter to the user (things not necessarily popular enough to warrant adding a new tag for everyone). Still no way to add a workout that happened yesterday. In addition to all this, the app sometimes just won't launch at all, crashing after it loads, leaving the user with no way to see any data from the ring for hours at a time. Yes, I've tried all the troubleshooting steps each time; the only solution was always to wait.  Update: App won't launch, and I need to see the battery level to know if I need to drive home to get my charger before my overnight trip or not."
4,From the Bayside,"Just knowing the app will ‚Äúreport‚Äù my activities back to me keeps me more disciplined about sleep and movement. It‚Äôs spotty on the physical activities- will pick up an 11 minute walk but miss a 30 minute one! On the other hand it makes me realize how onerous some of my caretaking responsibilities are when it reports back a ‚Äúworkout‚Äù for 15 minutes at midnight‚Äî and it was ‚Äújust‚Äù the physicality of a challenging caretaking task.   TIP: to avoid the spinning disconnect signal when you switch it to airplane mode - a real annoyance - click for airplane then cancel, then click on airplane again and complete. This usually avoids having to shut down the app, take the ring off its charger and starting all over."
1,HydroDynamicSpatualar,"Ordinarily this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. The problem is that I just bought the watch, opened it up and began the set up. Download and open the Oura app, get the email that lets you complete the set up for your account and go through the steps there. Get the message ‚Äúwelcome to the ours community, valuable member‚Äù and am told to return to the app. I click continue on the app and am met with a messages saying that it cannot validate my email. Try again, same thing. The app does not want to verify my email even though I have followed all the instructions. This error persists no matter what I do, different email? Same error. Oh the best part is I can access ‚Äúoura on the web‚Äù using my credentials and on there is says my email address is validated but the app still will not let me continue the setup due to my email being ‚Äúunverified‚Äù."
3,Meglet84,"I don‚Äôt normally write app reviews, but I‚Äôm doing so in hopes the developers will see this and make appropriate changes. I love my Oura and have for years, but the new lower density UI of the app is swollen and clunky without offering any new information. I much prefer the more condensed view of contributor information on the readiness, sleep, and activity tabs on previous versions of the app. This new lower density view is a step back from previous versions. Maybe some said the text size needed to be larger, but at the very least offer a choice for a smaller and more condensed view (the same as it was before). This new UI makes it impossible to see all contributor data on the screen at once. Please bring back the condensed view!"
4,Billmeout,"I‚Äôve been using this for a while and at the last update had to go to the beta version. I keep the app updated and check it daily out of habit. I‚Äôm not locked into it because the sleep function isn‚Äôt really reliable ( when I‚Äôm on the computer or reading it either has me napping or going to bed), and if I don‚Äôt actively set myself up as exercising, it seems to do a spot check in. But I still look at it. I tried to activate it today and only got the message that the beta version expired. Nothing else, no way to troubleshoot. So I came here to maybe pull a real app, and nothing. Tried to go to the help function and it doesn‚Äôt work.  So now I guess there‚Äôs nothing?"
4,Continual Afib,As a person with Afib Oura has worked great in tracking my sleep and monitoring my daily heart rate.  I am however missing my resting heart rate and averages.  When in workout mode it does a great job of giving my continual heart rate.  The doctors have chosen to treat my Afib with medication rather than surgery to stop it as it‚Äôs not  interfering with my day to day life.   More and more patients are living with Afib these days as more and more people are finding out they have it.    How can we as Afib patients get the full benefits of our Oura ring in future updates.  Could we have an update for those of us who live with Afib ? Or maybe there is a better device that you know of which works for us the chronic Afib patient.
3,Val Hella,"So i researched watches and found the Oura. I bought it because I understood it to be a fitness and sleep tracker and because I can sleep in a ring much easier than I can in a clunky watch or a tech savvy ‚ÄúHi Fashion‚Äù watch. So far the app does not offer the option to record a Kickboxing workout, it is either HIIT or boxing which according to my gym wearable both miss the mark. I am also not seeing the ring pick up my workout heart rate. Now I have only had it for a week so I am hoping someone here can help me navigate it better or maybe I can find some YouTubes that will help me find what I am looking for. But I was also expecting my Apple Health to pick up the work out heart rate from the ring and so far they are only reading the sleeping heart rate."
2,Lucythemck,"Seriously save your money. My ring keeps skipping data for no other reason than software issues which apparently are rare, yet I‚Äôve experienced it three time since the ring was gifted to me on Christmas. I contacted customer services & nobody got back to me for three days. There was no apology for the lack of response & there has been no apology for ‚Äòrare software issues‚Äô that they are working on. So bare in one if you purchase this, you will have to deal w consistent ‚Äòrare‚Äô glitches. Happy to share my email correspondence w anyone should they be interested.   I have other basics complaints such as inability to log workouts for anything other than the current day. It‚Äôs not recommended to wear the ring whilst weight training, so I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt always remember to add the workout that day, especially if I train in the evening, so the data for that day is essentially inaccurate.  It also doesn‚Äôt record you as sleeping if you only get a few hrs. If you have insomnia, don‚Äôt buy this ring.  I‚Äôm giving it two stars bc it‚Äôs definitely been interesting to get a basic understanding of how certain things affect my sleep, however, having experienced the ‚Äòrare‚Äô glitches, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how accurate it is. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
5,Ripley3619,"I love this ring and all of it's technology hidden away inside such a tiny innovation. It tracks my sleep and activity very accurately for the most part. Here are it's shortcomings: If you ride a motorcycle, if you use a leaf blower, if you use a chainsaw, etc.... Your ring will confuse it for exercise. Olympic athlete type exercise! As a result, my activity and therefore overall score is off the charts which is highly inaccurate.  Oura, please allow the user to go in and modify detected activity for what it is. The user should be able to select the misread activities and sort them properly. My ring must think I'm a marathon runner sprinting around the world but I'm actually just commuting to work on a motorcycle."
2,Used to be Oura User,"I have had an Oura Ring since 2021 and loved all of the information available to me.  After 2 1/2 years it finally died and well past any warranty so I ordered a new Gen 3 Ring.    Now that my month is up I can‚Äôt get any of the information I used to be able to access with My Gen 2 Ring without paying for a subscription.  When it came, I thought they were referring to all the fancy extra tracking (that I wouldn‚Äôt use) that would be a trial for a month.  Not so, only 3 basic items that are less than what you get in a Gen 2.   For $300 we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay even more (I also bought the extended warranty in case it died again beyond a year) for data that came normally with a lesser expensive and older generation model.    I will be looking into selling it because it is basically useless to me now.  I can get the 3 basic details from my watch.  I am all about improvements and upgrades but  to be a loyal and repeat customer and now having to pay extra for these things that are still available on Gen 2 doesn‚Äôt sit well with me.  If my Gen 2 still worked I wouldn‚Äôt have even known this.  So if your thinking about getting a Gen 3, get ready to pay more."
1,furuyama,"The Gen3 rollout is making me change my mind about the company.   I ordered the Gen2 and received it and was happy with it. Upon the announcement of the Gen3, I was offered a free upgrade since I had only recently purchased the Gen2. This seemed like a great move for customer satisfaction.   The whole experience/process has been completely downhill since. Claiming the upgrade was confusing as it took them two days to acknowledge. Part of the condition for the free upgrade was that I return my Gen2 first and then they would send my Gen3. I have since returned my Gen2 but can‚Äôt get any confirmation about my Gen3 being sent to me. Their customer service sends the same generic responses and then just ghosts you completely. My ‚Äòshipping update‚Äô email promised my ring would be shipped this week‚Ä¶and here we are at the end of the week with nothing, meanwhile I see on Reddit and instagram countless people receiving their rings but I still can‚Äôt get a human response from customer support.   So I have neither Gen2 nor Gen3, and no ability to actually speak with anyone as to how/when/if they can make it right.   Their customer service has been an embarrassment. In my industry, a rollout and subsequent failure to support would‚Äôve cost someone their job."
5,PYRO-X 2024,Liked the ring while it worked but now it doesn't hold a charge long enough to even get through my day. I haven't tried to return yet but have read on forums that it not and easy to get a response or replacement ring for this issue. We will see. I‚Äôll add some stars if the process goes smoothly. Also Heart Rate Variability is wacked on mine so i disregard this info all together. Sleep tracking is pretty spotty some nights but i believe this is related to the battery issue. The device has great potential but for $300 i had hoped i would get a perfectly functioning ring :( or at least a quick easy exchange program.
5,Gratitude girl,"Oura just celebrated me for over three years of using Oura. In that time I‚Äôve largely overcome PEM and dramatically improved my sleep quality after decades of chronic illness and sleep deprivation. We are such big fans everyone in our family from 14 yo to 82 wears one - three generations! Each one of us has different goals. So grateful to have this ally by our sides.   Ps - we too have run into the occasional battery or other issue - every single time customer service is impeccable. Oh! And I get easily overwhelmed cognitively / brain fog with tech gadgets but even I can easily do all updates, charging, even ring swaps when we upgraded. Just the best."
5,Finance76,"I‚Äôve been fascinated by HRV and health metrics for sometime but most devices just don‚Äôt live up to the hype.   So, I was not optimistic about the Oura.  However, once I got it and spent some time with the device I am VERY impressed.  The extra sensors that keep track of temperature and respiration really help add accurate assessments to the HRV reading.    In my time with the new ring (pre-ordered) it has been extremely accurate.   When I was sick it knew I was sick.  Sometimes even before I knew.   When I ate bad foods or drank too much it told me to take it easy the next day.     I‚Äôm very impressed and the team has done a great job.   The software is well polished and the ring looks and feels great."
4,A__D__S,"I love my Oura ring. I feel like it‚Äôs given me some very valuable insights into my health. However, it‚Äôs missing one glaring functionality. You cannot add workouts from previous days. Sometimes I do active things in the evenings and in the midst of dinner after and winding down I forget to input the activity that night. The app does not enable you to go back and add a workout. I understand it calculates your readiness score based off the previous day‚Äôs information, but it‚Äôs an algorithm. It should be able to recalculate based on new information. Without this functionality, my readiness scores are not reflective my true levels. Oura, please fix this."
5,sspediacci,"There nothing out there for me that comes close to being able to wear 24/7, great for tracking casual runs/bike rides/walks, has a good connection with Apple Health to pick up more intense activities tracked in other apps, and captures my overall recovery trends accurately.   I am not a fan of how ugly smart watches are and prefer an old school watch (heck give me a Timex) over the Apple Watch. I‚Äôve never worn rings before, but this one is clean and fits in with my style simply enough that I don‚Äôt mind it.   Also, if you‚Äôre concerned about cost - I don‚Äôt even drink coffee, but Oura is cheaper than your average caffeine addiction."
4,ihhenixibdbsi,"Of all the wearables, this is the best most convenient option. I‚Äôve owned their rings since the inception and abandoned my whoop which was a similar competitor. The ring is a put it on and forget about it device. Lots of data points that are ok accurate considering it‚Äôs size and location. The major flaw is the wear of the ring. Scratches fairly easy and especially if you lift any weights. Considering the cost, they could have used real metal that would look better when scratched. Or at least a colored polymer instead of a finish coat. Perhaps wearing it on a toe would be better. All the finishes wear similar. Silver would probably wear the best as that is what is below the exterior coat."
5,Tried to make it work. ,"This app has delivered all that the hype about it said. The unexpected surprise for me was the educational component. I‚Äôve learned a lot about sleep patterns in general and how to improve mine. The links to white papers and detailed explanations of the charts and graphs is extraordinary. Further, tying the education to my actual experiences and opportunities for improving sleep is very impressive. Thank you for this contribution to improving my health.  In addition the personalized support responses clarifying how to better use the tool and how it works has been wonderful. It takes them a few days to respond but the response was worth the wait. Thanks!"
1,RobCop12,"Very difficult to get someone online to speak with. I ordered a ring and decided I wanted a different color.  Never could get someone to return an email never mind find someone to speak to.  In addition, I received the plastic rings (for sizing) but never completed the steps to get the real ring. Not one email from the company asking if I was having a problem. I thought maybe, once they noticed i had t completed the order - I could switch my color. No luck. I do receive these emails about rating them or whatever but not a single real customer service email. So my rating is about their service not the ring. Their customer service is the worst.  Even on the most recent ‚Äòrate us‚Äô email, it says click here to contact customer service. It takes me to their main page.  Worst experience ever."
1,Dr. A.R.T.,"First, there is no one to talk too. Response time is slow and sometimes zero. From the way my wife and I were treated it seems that they don‚Äôt really care to service a client, just sell more rings. We had ordered two of the diamond rings at about $1000 each, plus  four more rings for our friends.   When they came out with the Gen 3 we asked to get updated for free or for a discount due to fact that they got rid of the diamond ring we paid a premium for. We ended up still buying the Gen 3‚Ä¶ No refund for the diamond ring just a year service which was free when we bought the first rings. my Gen 3 starts acting up about a month after the one year warranty. Sent emails to company and they told me all they could do is offer $75 discount on a new one. They are rude and the responses are nearly all robotic, there is no human to talk too, ever.  The Device is helpful and I enjoy it when it‚Äôs working properly. Looking forward to another company with great customer service, a company that cares about their clients and hopefully makes the same or better device to come into the market. We have bought 8 rings total. Oura Ring is very disappointing on many levels.  Dr. A.R.T"
3,soupheist,"My review for Oura 2 was 5 stars. All I'm looking for is a sleep tracker that feels accurate. Since I switched to 3 the app constantly gets the Time Asleep wrong by several hours and I have to adjust it. Sometimes even including time periods when I wasn't even wearing the ring. Once in awhile I'll correct the time asleep, check back in later in the day, and it's reset to be the incorrect amount again. It's also frustrating that you can't adjust the Time Asleep on old entries for this reason.   It's also become A Lot harder to sync. I'll often have to try multiple times, when previously this was almost never an issue.  Fingers crossed this will improve, but overall super disappointed in the past 3 mos performance."
2,susan9870,"I purchased a Oura ring in September shortly before the Gen 3 version was announced. When the announcement was made about getting to exchange recently purchased Gen2, I tried to order but never got confirmation. Then a few days later, I received the offer to exchange and get free lifetime membership so I ordered again. I just received the sizing kit and was entering my size when I noticed 2 orders. I have been trying to get help to make sure I only get one of the Gen 3. I returned the Gen 2 ring (received by the company Nov 16) and submitted the size needed before that date. I am not getting any helpful replies, just automatically generated messages saying they‚Äôre busy and will be in touch. I really liked the ring I had for the time I had it, but this experience has made me question the reliability of this company."
3,Yarmo Zone.,"I am amazed at all the data this ring captures. That said, there are two issues I have with the app. First, the gps doesn‚Äôt track well. It often shows me walking across a lake I routinely walk around, and therefore my mileage is off. Yet the steps are tracked correctly. Easy math would show there is no way I‚Äôd have that many steps if the route was captured correctly. Second, we should be able to rearrange the tiles on any of the tabs and hide the ones we don‚Äôt care about.  Finally, the new walking test is terrible.  The ring rarely connects to even do the test.  And everything is charged and working fine otherwise.  It‚Äôs clear this was rolled out without proper real world testing."
3,McOsompants,"I‚Äôm writing this in hopes that the developers will see this and make a change/fix. I really like this ring, but I would like to be able to add my own custom tag to my sleep chart. When I click into the sleep score or sleep efficiency chart it gives the option to add tags and activities. I click on this and don‚Äôt see a tag that fits my description so I write a short comment description and click done. If I don‚Äôt actually click on a tag then nothing shows up after I leave the comment. Please add a method to make a custom tag so that it shows up along the bottom of the line chart and not just in a comment section somewhere else. If there is a way to do this I haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, my apologies."
3,wtwar,"I love this product! I‚Äôve only had it for a couple of days and before this I have never worn a ring for long periods of time in my life. I love how light weight and clean looking it is! I would be giving this a 5 star rating but the reason why I got the ring was because my brother and sister-in-law have one as well and I was hoping to share my readiness, sleep, activity, etc. within the app. I would recommend an option within the app to add friends and select certain things that you want your friends to see. I know for some people they may not want to share EVERYTHING about their personal health but there are somethings that would be fun to share with family or friends. Thanks for an awesome product!"
2,50 and Jacked,"I have the Whoop band and an Apple Watch, but I dislike wearing them and bought the Oura ring since it doesn‚Äôt go on the wrist.  I am an frustrated that it seems to do a terrible job at recording sleep.  Wearing both the Oura and Whoop one, the Oura one seems unable to properly capture when I go to sleep‚Ä¶often showing my sleep time 2 hours later than when I went to sleep (which the Whoop seems to get correct).  On a night where the Whoop band is off, you can at least edit the start time in the Whoop and it recalculates it.  You can‚Äôt edit the sleep time in the Oura app to start earlier when it incorrectly sets your sleep start window late.  As such, the ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù and ‚Äúinsights‚Äù are useless because it based on sometimes as much as 2 hours of sleep missing."
1,Ssilver7,"What is going on with the development team? The functions are getting more and more ridiculous. Just to name a few‚Ä¶ for any workout, if you happen to not be the person that constantly check the apps and confirm the workouts right away. Guess what, you would lose all the records next day. (You may see it show up, but it won‚Äôt be incorporated into any stats in the prior day‚Ä¶ so thank the app for showing a 200 calories day when you work a hard workout for 1000 calories) Thanks to it, I now have lost HOURS AND HOURS of records which completely screw up my long term records. If the app can‚Äôt provide me with a reliable tracker over time, what is the point of using this? BUYER beware‚Ä¶ unless you are a fanatics that checks this app every hour, good luck with keeping a good history of workouts"
2,Marcosa56,"The hardware is good - really accurate and helpful. The app originally took me a day to learn my way around. With the new update, every time I go to the app, I‚Äôm still not sure how to find what I‚Äôm looking for. It now takes multiple clicks to find things that took zero or one click before.  A good UI redesign should enable a user to clearly see what was improved. I don‚Äôt see it. After reading the blog post on the new redesign, I still don‚Äôt understand what the goals were and how anything is any better.  IMO Oura should revert the changes and do more user/beta testing before launching.  One more thing on the redesign - there‚Äôs too much focus on today. It‚Äôs now much harder to find and view a previous day‚Äôs data"
3,Nicole Sangiorgi-Bell,"I‚Äôve had my ring for about a year. I‚Äôve noticed ever since the update that includes the blood oxygen sensors (and a few other updates after) my ring randomly and frequently disconnects from my phones Bluetooth.   I find this extremely aggravating as it does not seem to record my workouts. I‚Äôll run 3 miles and it will tell me I‚Äôve only taken a couple hundred steps from prior to my run. Constantly showing my activity score to be low and I always ‚Äúmiss‚Äù my goal.   The workout tracker was one of the main reasons I purchased the ring. The fact that it is not recording anything is frustrating, especially given the price point of the ring. This is not an issue with my phone as all my other devices such as wireless headphones will stay connected until I turn my Bluetooth off or manually disconnect.   I often only have my ring connected and use wired headphones in case that may be an issue. No matter what I do, my ring frequently disconnects and I don‚Äôt discover it has until my workout is over. Even if it connects prior, it does not stay connected."
3,Cal B 7,"I love my Oura ring and love the Oura app, when it works. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had issues with the app not opening three times in the last month. When I click the app to open it, I see the Oura logo screen and then it disappears. The only solution I‚Äôve found is to uninstall the app and reinstall it, but then I have to be near my charger in order to reconnect the ring to my phone. This is a bit annoying because I often travel without the charger for a few days and can‚Äôt access the data until I get home. I‚Äôve waited for a few updates to see if the issue would be resolved but nothing so far. Would love to see the issue go away, because it‚Äôs a five star review without it."
1,Kristingavaza,"I‚Äôve had the oura ring for a year now and I loved it at first. Unfortunately, it started to go down quickly the last few months. I started to notice that when I would open the app to check data, I would more and more frequently find that the ring was just no longer sync‚Äôed and therefore, without any notification, had just not been collecting all the data. It then requires troubleshooting - restarting my phone, sometimes having to ‚Äúforget the device,‚Äù put the ring on the charger and go through the process of adding it back. It‚Äôs very tedious and now something I want to be doing about weekly like I have been for months now. This product and this app are way too expensive to be having all these problems. I love the concept but it‚Äôs very frustrating."
5,IcedBBleach,"I got my Oura ring a few months ago to pair with my Natural Cycles Birth Control app. At first, I just wanted to be able to take my basal body temperature with convenience, but now I use it to keep track of my heart rate, sleep patterns, physical activity, and more. Every day Oura gives me a little tip for how to take care of my body depending on my recent conditions, which I think is awesome. It is a little bit spendy, I will admit that, but in the long run it was definitely worth it for me. If you‚Äôre interested in learning about and taking control of your health, and you have the money to do so, I definitely recommend Oura."
5,LittleLee12,"I love this ring. My husband bought my first rig and I wasn‚Äôt sure about it. However; I truly love it and so glad he bought the first one. I now have Oura Ring Gen3 and I‚Äôm extremely happy with it. Not just the sleep information but the heart, goals, readiness, activity and the weekly/monthly data they provide.   I provided some feedback and they sent my feedback to the developers. They are quick with responses for any question you have or need assistance with.   I‚Äôm m, usually, terrible with providing feedback, however. I just can‚Äôt say enough about the product, the app and the developers."
1,RaRoIEII47,I have gone through four rings and now need a fifth in just over three years. I love it when it works but it doesn‚Äôt last long. Oura‚Äôs  warranty was two years but now it‚Äôs only one I would guess because they were having to replace too many rings with a two year warranty. I saw my ring was only getting less than three days charge while it was still under warranty but when I contacted customer service they were rather pointed in telling me it was fine. Now two months later and out of warranty it won‚Äôt even hold a charge for 24 hours. If I buy another it will be my fifth ring in just three years and three months. I wouldn‚Äôt even d replacing every couple of years but once a year is two mucbh for me. Should last longer for the price.
2,Margee848,"I hate the new app UI redesign. The previous version was simple and fairly intuitive, in the new one you need unnecessarily many clicks to find any information you previously got with one swipe. I for example start my day by looking at my sleep pattern. Now the icons for each block (activity, sleep,..) are on the top of the front page (which means I can‚Äôt use my thumbs to click them). But once you click them, they move to the bottom - why? I never find resilience anymore since it‚Äôs not part of the blocks but under something else called Health hidden under a tab. How is Health different from other data and the blocks? I‚Äôm 30+ but feel senile since I just don‚Äôt get this and how does it serves us better. I hate it, sorry."
1,Tjm777,"I‚Äôve been an Oura ring user for years. I loved Gen2 ring and decided to upgrade when Gen3 came out. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had nothing but problems with the Gen3 ring after about 9 months of use.  My first Gen3 ring was replaced by Oura at about this time last year. After many messages with Oura support they finally acknowledged an issue with the battery. The ring would be 100% when I went to bed and less than 50% when I woke up. In addition, it wouldn‚Äôt sync any readiness and sleep data.   I was happy after the replacement as the ring worked as advertised.   Now I‚Äôm at about the same age as my original Gen3 and have similar issues. The ring won‚Äôt sync any sleep or readiness data and the activity tracking is way off. For example, I went on a 3 mile run and a 2 mile walk and the ring said I only had 2,418 steps.  I‚Äôve been messaging Oura support for over a month with no success at resolving the issue. The ring is worthless to me in its current state and support isn‚Äôt offering any help. I wish Oura would take responsibility for product issues and just replace the ring.  Sadly, I‚Äôve encouraged many friend and colleagues to get an Oura ring. I won‚Äôt be doing that any longer."
1,action{snacks};,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt like I should in this case. I‚Äôve been a dedicated supporter of Oura since 2018, and have been an early adopter of their rings for two generations now. The recent poor communication regarding the detrimental impact of their updates re: battery life, as well as poor communication regarding the product and services themselves is a departure from the company I once loved. Their support is incredibly condescending. Their product communication is beyond terrible, especially when certain colorways risk damaging other belongings. Their service and overall offerings have seen an incredible decline and lack of care for even their dedicated user base over the years.  In 2019, I would have shouted ‚Äúfive stars!‚Äù Now, you‚Äôd be best to avoid this company, app, and product like the plague."
1,TheBiggestApple,"What‚Äôs the famous saying, if it isn‚Äôt broken don‚Äôt fix it? Oura, what‚Äôs been going on the past month? Not only is all Heart Rate readings is gone, my sleep data hasn‚Äôt uploaded properly to the app for the past week. I went through all the trouble shooting from Oura support from soft resets, to the hard resetting where you tap the ring on the charger, deleting the app, reinstalling the app, deleting everything on phone and reinstalling everything(process take hours), to no avail. My family who never updated their software, everything is working fine for them.  July has not been Oura month. Even the Oura Gucci ring, was in stock in many sizes, hours later Gucci‚Äôs remove the Oura link even though the rings didn‚Äôt sell out.  I‚Äôll update this review when everything is resolved. Good luck to my fellow Oura ring owners."
5,Four String Lulu,"I didn‚Äôt want an Apple Watch bc I didn‚Äôt want to be peppered by email, texts, etc. I did need an uncomplicated meditation tool and something to measure sleep activity. I have had the ring for about a year and I am sleeping better, longer, fewer middle of the night wake up sessions. I can select meditation modes as well. The data tracked for the price is such a great deal. I see the ring as a tool or measuring item but I have gotten so many unsolicited ‚Äúwow that ring is good looking‚Äù comments that I now realize it‚Äôs also perceived as jewelry !  If you‚Äôre on the fence about making a purchase and/or have sleep issues , this ring will help you!"
3,Skips789,"Oura doesn‚Äôt handle if a person wakes up in the middle of the night for an extended duration. When I went to check my sleep score this morning it tried to say that I had napped twice late last night, the first starting at the time I went to bed. I cancelled that because it was part of my sleep and wasn‚Äôt a nap. Then it said my sleep was excessively short starting early this morning and I had no way to edit the start time to what it actually was. I had thought this could be done. I could not go back to re-add the naps to at least get some accounting for them.   I now have record amounts of restorative time split between yesterday and today."
4,skibumB4,"I have found this to be a good wearable device overall. I do not think that some of the interpretations made are accurate, especially around sleep. I think my Fitbit is actually more accurate on logging my activity.  I also have had ongoing issues with being able to get the updates to load which is frustrating.  Cosmetically, the metal became scratched up very quickly which is unfortunate considering the cost.   I have recommended it to people who have asked about it.  I‚Äôm considering purchasing the latest version but the cost is definitely slowing me down from making the jump."
1,dianasaurus rex,I used to love the oura ring (have a gen 2) but the quality of the application has become terrible. I‚Äôm the last ~2 years I‚Äôve had my ring replace 2 times because of tech issues. I didn‚Äôt decide to upgrade to the gen 3 when they offered because there was really no discount for longtime users. For the past week the app has been crashing on me and I finally decided to reinstall it so I could reset my ring and now it tells me I can‚Äôt access my information the same way because I need a membership??? (I‚Äôm also straight up locked out of my account for no reason.) Customer service does not care about their customers and doesn‚Äôt provide any help at all. Absolute trash. Unfortunate because they really have the best form factor but I will no longer be using this device!!!
4,ChcltShan,"I love my ≈åura ring! The data I‚Äôm able to see daily is pretty on track with how I sleep and do my activities affecting my energy levels. I gave 4 out of five stars for one reason. I feel that a major market is being missed. I‚Äôve noticed that my ≈åura ring has picked up on my fertility window by tracking my body temperature. I would love to be able to add a tag for ovulation or fertility window, but there‚Äôs currently no option to do so. As someone who works in women‚Äôs health care, I can‚Äôt help but think how groundbreaking it would be if ≈åura could incorporate the ability to track ovulation. All other areas that the ring picks up on are great! I love that the charge holds for a long time too."
1,jgspin,"The Oura app was great until the latest update. This is one of the least intuitive user interfaces I‚Äôve ever encountered. It used to be so simple to see everything and now the data I want is hidden behind multiple screens, taps, and clicks. Maybe the worst part of it is the actual screens with the data are the SAME, it just takes way more taps to get to them and find them. Why do they need to be hidden away?! I used to be able to open the app in the morning and take a quick scroll through my numbers, how I slept, how the overall week is looking, etc. Now, I hardly want to use the app anymore. It‚Äôs ridiculously counterintuitive and just impossible to remember where things are hidden. So frustrating since we have to pay the monthly fee anyway‚Ä¶ beyond disappointed."
3,jfhehr,"The Oura worked for a year, then just quit. The app won‚Äôt update. The hardware won‚Äôt update. The ring, while fully charged, won‚Äôt communicate with the app. So now it‚Äôs just a piece of jewelry.  While it worked, I‚Äôd say the Oura was ‚Äúokay.‚Äù It was good for tracking body temperature, but unable to distinguish between lying awake but still and being in light sleep (watching a movie = sleep, staring at the ceiling from 2:00 - 3:00 = sleep); that‚Äôs not great for older users.  For walks and runs, distance tracking was in the ballpark but not super accurate. Fitbits also were off by 15-20% when introduced, so maybe that will improve with time.  Readiness number feels pretty on-point, and it was useful to see how a second glass of wine or a heavy, late dinner affected sleep (even though I felt that impact myself). On the other hand, having the occasional brutal 3:45 of sleep get a ‚Äú78‚Äù rating was ludicrous, especially when paired with my daily (high) activity level.  Overall, Oura gets an ‚Äúeh‚Äù rating. The sudden failure of app and hardware is pretty disappointing though. I‚Äôll be sticking with my Garmin in the future."
2,PressMyBet,"Order three rings for the family this Christmas. My daughter and I got our rings. The rings feel a little cheap but the product works as advertised and the app has great data that supports living a healthy lifestyle.   Now, let‚Äôs talk about the third ring‚Ä¶. Oh wait, still haven‚Äôt received it yet. The same response I have received on the three customer issue claims is that the USPS has lost it. ‚ÄúPlease look around to find your ring.‚Äù  We‚Äôve done this. Nothing. I now I get no additional acknowledgment of my missing ring. At this point the wife things I boomed on her Christmas present and I am out the $300+. They should be able to track or identify if the ring is online somewhere using their app, etc. so they would now if I‚Äôm lying or trying to cheat them. Still got nothing.   Don‚Äôt buy the dang ring unless you can get it in your possession right away. Their customer service is non existent if you have issues. No number. They‚Äôre located in Finland which makes it almost impossible for any quick response. In this case, I just wish I could get a response and resolution.   Anyone got an extra ring for sale?"
5,VAMagnus20,"The Oura ring changed my life. Seeing and learning from the data analysis from Oura opened my eyes to habits and trends that I didn‚Äôt realize or didn‚Äôt see (consciously or unconsciously). Entering and understanding these trends have helped me make changes in my life that have resulted in an amazingly healthy lifestyle. Better sleep, mental health, lost weight and increased cardiovascular health/capacity. If I had the opportunity and power to provide everyone with an Oura ring I would without hesitation. All hyperbolics aside, this is an amazing piece of art and machinery. The data and analytics are amazing. Honestly a life changing device. Andrew Ennis"
3,Po------,"I‚Äôve worn my Oura ring daily for the last 5 months. It has made me more generally conscious of my health and sleep. That‚Äôs good and I guess it was worth the price of purchase for me. But much of data it provides are unreliable.  It seems to accurately detect my periods of deep sleep, but it often can‚Äôt tell when I‚Äôm awake or in light sleep; not sure about REM sleep accuracy. I‚Äôve lain awake for hours when Oura thought I was sleeping, and I‚Äôve had several times when I was sound asleep but Oura thought I was awake.   Activity detection is not very accurate either. For example, today I walked an easy ~4-5 miles. Oura thought I walked 6.9 miles. This is typical.  Customer support has been responsive and very polite, but basically ineffectual.   I most appreciate the heart rate and heart rate variability monitoring. I can‚Äôt say it has been inaccurate and it feels like a good gauge of my health level from day to day. There are other less reliable inputs to the Readiness and Sleep scores, so those scores in general are not so useful.  If your expectations are low enough and $300 is no big deal to you then you might enjoy this product."
5,SSueH,"I am a new user of the Oura ring and love its ability to track sleep, activity, and heart health.  It provides valuable insight on when you need to take a rest or push yourself.    I do have a request for a future development.  Many women would like the ability to track hot flashes. It could be a great tool to help women have conversations with their doctor about appropriate treatments based on the severity. It always shows insight not why there was restless sleep or temprature fluctuations or spike in heart rate.   I would love this option to be considered on behalf of thousands of women struggling every day with hot flashes."
4,JamieBethRN,"Still playing around with my new ring and app but so far I‚Äôm having problems importing workouts into Oura that are recorded from my Apple Watch/Health app. Read the support questions on the website and looks like both apps must be open and active so I‚Äôve fixed that and hope it works today. But I‚Äôm disappointed that it doesn‚Äôt appear that the Oura app will import my daily activity like steps and active calories. That‚Äôs unfortunate. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt wear my ring during the day so not sure this is going to work out for me as simply a sleep tracker. Oura, let us import our steps and activity from Apple Health please!"
2,ewh410,"After weeks of troubleshooting with Oura, they finally admitted that, if you‚Äôre not wearing the ring, their app can‚Äôt import running, walking, elliptical and other workout data recorded through Apple Health. Their explanation is below, which, from a technology company, is unbelievable:  It's common that devices with their own accelerometers do not share Steps data. The reason for this is due to the variation in how trackers calculate STEPS.  This includes algorithms, manufacturing procedures, materials, sensor types, and so forth. More specifically, Oura is a 3D accelerometer with an algorithm that identifies steps from your unique movement. Apple Health uses an accelerometer in your phone + GPS to track your steps.  Simply put, we do not sync this data because each device/app show different step estimates because they use a different method of categorizing steps.   C‚Äômon Oura, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the sync has an exact count of steps or mileage. It just matters that there was a recordation of an approximation of the activity.  Love the ring for sleep tracking, but I don‚Äôt prefer to wear it during the day, as it‚Äôs a bit chunky."
5,Mazatch,"Came back after having the ring for 7mo now, and now I love it. The updates are frequent and every time I wish there was a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù new feature, they deliver. It gives me the confidence that my ring will continuously keep getting better and the app even more useful. New custom tag feature is great, now if we could get rid of tags we‚Äôd never use, that‚Äôd be awesome. Wink wink. But seriously, love my ring! In a scary situation, it helped me see and find the cause of why I suddenly wasn‚Äôt feeling well, for which  I‚Äôm grateful, because it convinced me to get medical attention when I needed it."
5,brucem142,I have the Gen 3 ring and about 2 weeks ago the Oura App started to crash. I deleted it and reinstalled it at least 10 times. I notified Oura and was notified that they are aware of the problem but the app still crashes. Up until now everything worked fine. Without the app the ring is useless. I do not recommend this ring. If and when they fix the problem I will change my review.  Apparently the problem with the app was corrected. It is working fine now and I changed the rating to 5 stars and highly recommend the Oura ring.
1,James Rukstalis,"I received the ring as a gift. I charged it first day and wore it for 24 hours. It only monitored about one hour and nothing else. When I put it back on the charger the next day and looked at the app, it didn‚Äôt record anything for sleep cycle, heart rate, or pretty much anything. Just functioned right for an hour after I started wearing it and then stopped.  I responded to the daily email with the problems and was given an auto reply that they don‚Äôt monitor emails and won‚Äôt respond. I do get the requests to pay Oura money for a subscription, which seems to be all this company actually cares about.  This seems like a gimmick to sell to companies. It would be interesting if it might have worked, but this just seems like it was a waste of money spent on me by the company who bought it for me."
4,J.walk08,"Overall, I feel like this has been the best on the market. That being said, a few tweaks would make the user experience much much better. 1. I hate having to open the app to have the information sync, this should just refresh in the background without having to think about it 2. Same as number one, but during workouts it automatically refreshing and tracking in the background is how it should operate 3. A widget for iOS would be helpful once the nail the background refresh, so I can simply see on my Home Screen how the day is going. 4. The app could use additional features to make Oura an all in one power house. Features like calorie tracking, nutrition tracking, and then features that help you understand your body more (how many calories does my body need, what would give me a deficit, syncing with a scale even, etc).  Overall, I don‚Äôt regret the purchase and will continue to love my Oura ring. 4/5. Fix the above and you‚Äôll be a 10/5!"
5,frmaru893,"I have been using Oura on a daily basis for 6 months now and the experience has been great so far. I love the comprehensive analytics and the minimalistic design, and the new visualizations and meditation features are definitely a great way to iterate the product. I would suggest enhancing the user‚Äôs ability to switch to airplane mode in a more intuitive manner. I wear several devices simultaneously and I usually have them on airplane mode to reduce exposure to radiation. In that context, it would be useful if I could just turn on/off the airplane mode at any time without having to connect the ring to the charger. Keep up the great work!"
4,Sash501,"I‚Äôm really enjoying this option over my trial of whoop.  Much easier interface to understand.  Two improvements I‚Äôd like to see.  1. Setting notifications to charge at different battery percentages.  I primarily use this for sleep tracking and having the reminder only before bed doesn‚Äôt fit for my use.  I‚Äôd like to be able to set the charge reminder at whatever percentage I choose, 20%, 45%, 50%, 85%, etc.  especially since it is recommended to not let the ring fall below a certain percentage.  2.  Y‚Äôall figure out how to make a slimmer ring and I‚Äôll buy another one!"
1,Life Coach Melanee,"My daughter and I both purchased a ring in late 2022.  She purchased the gold which was more expensive and I purchased the silver. Within a year, her rings battery wasn‚Äôt lasting three days. After repeatedly contacted customer service multiple times over a dozen they finally replaced her ring. Fast-forward until recently, and my ring started needing recharged after only two days. After contacting customer service, I was advised that my battery is working ‚Äúas expected‚Äù and they refuse to replace the ring or repair it.  If you want to spend a lot of money to only have it work less than a year, this is your item. Otherwise, you may want to purchase a whoop. And has a way better warranty! Along with more cooperative customer service"
1,Dfunk5,"Had the ring less than 2 weeks and it would never stay connected. What‚Äôs odd is that it would never be able to connect while I‚Äôm awake but somehow it was recording my sleep even when it wasn‚Äôt connected before I went to bed. Customer service is a joke. They respond once then ignore you for days. I know a product developer who specializes in wearables and I asked him about the Oura ring and he was not surprised with the issue I was having. He said the Oura ring is known to have a very high scrap rate in the industry, meaning many of them won‚Äôt work as intended largely due to poor design and manufacturing. What‚Äôs even worse is they make you pay return shipping for a product that came broken and never worked. So I pay $30 total in shipping costs to try a junk product for 2 weeks."
5,Dejennyp,"The ≈åura app is an incredible tool for anyone serious about optimizing their health and well-being. I genuinely love the detailed insights it provides on sleep, readiness, and activity levels. The sleep tracking is top-notch, offering in-depth analysis of sleep stages and trends that help me prioritize rest. The readiness score is a game-changer, guiding me on when to push myself or take it easy. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to understand all the metrics, and the personalized recommendations are a fantastic touch. It‚Äôs a must-have if you‚Äôre looking to improve your health in a holistic way."
3,Schmidiot,"The new UI makes it a pain to easily scroll through my data or find past information. I liked the previous update much better. It would also be nice to be able to import workouts from my Apple Watch to the Oura app more than just one day after they happened. I recently ran a marathon but can‚Äôt include the data in my ring because I forgot my charger at home and had the ring in airplane mode to save battery so I can‚Äôt include that race in my data (I didn‚Äôt realize you had to put it on the charger to turn airplane mode off, I misread the pop up thinking it auto turned off after 7 days but I could turn it on)."
5,neg_ions,"I use the open-ended guided sessions every day, sometimes twice a day to monitor my meditation for float sessions. The newest update as of a few days ago seems to have broken that feature for me. When I end the session ( by tapping the end session button ), it doesn‚Äôt actually end and does not show up as a daily activity any longer until about 3 hours later and then it says my sessions were 3 hours long. I am on an iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 14.8.1. I am a developer as well and have been recently playing around with the ≈åura API."
5,supervix3n,"The app is really easy to use & super intuitive. I love how every single thing can be tapped on which takes you to the Oura blog for more information. The trends are really insightful. Thanks to them, I know that it‚Äôs my work stress that‚Äôs been making me miserable, not at all how dark or cool my bedroom is or how well I slept. Finallt, it‚Äôs a tool yes, but a great one that nudges me to make better decisions about my life. I‚Äôve seriously cut back on alcohol ever since I started using it. Which was never even on my mind when I purchased the ring to find out why I wake up tired every day."
5,CiZEN,"Seriously though, they finally added a feature that lets you set your own goals. As a disabled person being able to set realistic goals is a huge win. Before I would get maybe 20% of the preset goal which made me feel like such a loser even though I push every day to reach my maximum potential. Being able to set my goal allows me reach it and feel good about reaching it! It‚Äôs a meaningful change and helps me feel better and work harder. Now if you guys will add a treadmill option for walking I‚Äôm set!  Great job Oura team!"
1,melodyba,"I‚Äôve had an Oura ring for a long time, at least 3 years now. The first was a gift from a friend who bought a new one. I loved it. The second, I bought after the old one finally began having battery trouble. I‚Äôve had problems with it from Day One, should have returned it. Now, it doesn‚Äôt agree with its own previously-collected data. I submitted screenshots to Support, and after 6 days, have heard nothing, though they gave me a case number. DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR MONEY  Edit:  another one star, I‚Äôd give zero if possible, for customer service.  After waiting ANOTHER 6 days (they supposedly sent my data/screenshots to the ‚Äúspecialist team‚Äù), still have heard nothing about why I‚Äôm not getting good data.  Last night, it wanted me to confirm a nap, in the middle of the night.  Please!  Such a waste of money."
3,sheanon,There has been others who have asked for this.  I know they have a more sophisticated measure of fitness but many people use other apps that read data from the health app. I would like the step count to be shared because other apps use it. A major reason for getting a ring is the compact size vs bringing your phone or even a smart watch. But now I find myself still bringing around my phone when I go for a run or walk in order to count steps. They save the step data already why not share it?  Also sleep tracking should include the ‚Äúrest‚Äù naps that it records.  There should be a metric that combines the rest and sleep time. I remember the jawbone app did this quite nicely before.
3,some girl(:,"I work night shift‚Ä¶i wish this app was more compatible with my schedule, such as reminders to move. It tells me it‚Äôs time to wind down when it‚Äôs right in the middle of my shift. It gives me my it constantly ranks my sleep timing as poor because i sleep during the day. I‚Äôve clicked that i have sleep problems because i work night shift or shift work, but i wish there was an option to tell it that night shift means my schedule is flopped so i could track everything better.  I also wish i could rearrange the categories on the app. I would like my heart rate readings at the top as soon as i open it.  The app isn‚Äôt bad, it could just be better."
3,sharonestl,"I love, love my Oura ring! My first ring was a gen2 and I upgraded as soon as the gen3 was available. However, I‚Äôve had my gen3 for a little over a year and am having connection and battery issues. I emailed customer service a couple of days ago and asides from the email they sent saying they got my email and set up a claim number I have heard nothing else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶It is extremely frustrating because I so enjoy the data the ring gives me and would really love to be able to use it again. The product is great when it‚Äôs working. 5 stars, but do to the lack of response from customer service, it has dampened my experience so I deducted a couple of stars."
1,studentzzzzzz,"Buyer Beware. In my case, I found the Oura Ring was not really giving me enough meaningful data and I decided to initiate a return for refund under their clearly stated 30 day return policy, however, the only way to do this is to follow an automated process through the app or website. The automated system repeatedly process fails to generate a RA # and shipping return label and continues to error in a never ending loop. Attempts to contact custom support are a dead end. No live person. No phone number. Meanwhile I am stuck with the bill. Very disappointed. Update Nov 5‚Ä¶ still zero response from Oura. No way to get in contact. Only automated app ‚Äòchat‚Äô and automated email. No live person. FRAUD update‚Ä¶ Nov. 8, still zero response from OURA. Purchased Oura Ring under 30 day return policy and OURA will NOT initiate the return."
2,AudioNET1,"I‚Äôve had two generations of the Oura Ring and I‚Äôm pretty disappointed. The readings are suspect - for example, it often says it detected a workout when I know for a fact I was seated and not working out. The other day it thought I was working out for 45 minutes but I was sitting down, driving. It‚Äôs results never agree with other sleep apps - so much so that my insomnia doctor believes it‚Äôs causing psychosomatic results (getting anxiety because the ring told me how terrible I‚Äôm sleeping when I may actually be getting better sleep than the app claims). I have written the developers multiple times with inconsistencies but they claim it‚Äôs working correctly. I wanted to like this device but I no longer trust it."
1,ernie bernie :),"Let me start by saying that I loved the oura ring when it was working. I‚Äôve had it for a little over 1 yr. And I have the gen 2. I use it to sync with natural cycles app which I pay a monthly fee for. About a month ago, the ring just stopped working (won‚Äôt sync, won‚Äôt log data). I reached out to customer support, which assured me that this was a known bug and they were working on it‚Ä¶ one month ago. And my ring is still not functional. Despite frequent attempts to connect with customer service for updates. So I am stuck paying a membership for natural cycles without having accurate data.   I was tempted to buy a gen 3 but thought against it because of how this is being handled. What happens if I spend $400 and it breaks‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs that.  Very disappointing."
5,ZenVester,"I‚Äôm now 3 years in and it‚Äôs cool to look back at my poor sleep habits and the progress I‚Äôve made to better my health. This ring has opened my eyes to the importance of sleep for every area of my life. It has cued me to pay attention to my energy and to take it easy if I‚Äôm coming down with something or over trained. Definitely worth every penny. I bought one for my adult son and recommend it to many. I discovered Matt Walker‚Äôs teachings alongside this ring, everything shifted for me. I now wind it down and follow rhythms of sun and Im regularly in 90s for Readiness Score."
4,antidisestablishmentarianism's,"It works quite well & appears to be accurate. They just instituted AI responses to questions and I hope that gets better. There are also a few  glitches (naps not recorded if close to the end of main sleep of the day, getting only ‚Äúfair‚Äù ratings if you have  a moderately heavy exercise level the day before, etc). There‚Äôs a lot of different measurements with only a few that seem weird (constant messages of a ‚Äúnew discovery‚Äù after adding a note about an unrecorded nap, not recording most meditations, etc). Overall, Oura is easy to use & provides a lot of insight into how your biology is working."
5,Oura-LOVE,"I‚Äôve had my Oura ring for a little over two years and it‚Äôs one of the rare apps I actually check daily. It has helped me with my health journey by providing sleep scores based on changes I make and activities goals based on my workouts. I absolutely love this app. At one point my original ring was losing battery extremely quickly, I contacted support and made them aware of the issue. Without thinking twice, they sent me a new ring, free of charge. That in itself makes me a loyal Oura fan. Thank you!"
5,Jbear29130,"I love my Oura ring and the app interface is beautiful and user-friendly, the data and insights it provides are amazing. The app has been very reliable, no bugs or connectivity issues, and updates have been excellent.  One feature I would love to see added is the ability to manually add naps or edit sleep times. Occasionally the ring doesn't pick up on these, and it would be helpful to be able to add them manually for a more accurate picture of my sleep patterns."
4,NicoleKS96,"I love the Oura app! I‚Äôve overall had an amazing experience, even with syncing data over to Natural Cycles. The one issue I‚Äôve come to have often is that the widgets on my Home Screen and Lock Screen will disappear anytime the app has an update. Usually I just have to add them back on my screen, but after this most recent update they aren‚Äôt even in the list as a possibility of having on my lock screen. Which is a bummer bc I do like to see my progress throughout the day real quick on my Lock Screen vs having to unlock my phone and open the whole app"
1,SlimothyTV,"Fix these for 5 stars:   1) Ring needs HALF sizes.  2) We need social options to share data with wife/husband. Like sharing Activity Rings on Apple Watch.   3) Fix Heart Rate tracking. It‚Äôs so bad. My smartwatch takes my HR every 2 mins. This thing struggles to get 1 reading every 30 mins. Really bad. Like legitimately bad during the day. Nighttime works great though.   4) Get rid of monthly fee. I wanted to buy these for my whole family (1,500$ in rings) but it‚Äôs POOR TASTE to gift someone something they have to pay monthly for. So Oura is losing a ton of money because of that. These rings die every 2 years anyway due to minuscule batteries. That‚Äôs a subscription of itself. Oura is DOUBLE DIPPING on premium hardware prices and a disgusting monthly fee.  5) Tags need to be completely overhauled. Basically useless as it is now.   6) Oura should let you know WHY heart rate data was missed for a period of time. Was it that the hand was too cold? Too much movement? Too loose? This would be incredibly valuable information to help figure out why HR data is so bad with Oura.    I will update this review later as I find more things wrong with the product."
1,Mich√≥n,"My friend gave me this ring after losing a bunch of weight and needing to order a different size. I love the way the ring fits, however the battery life has significantly drained and it doesn‚Äôt stay charged throughout a whole nights sleep. I have cleaned the contacts and everything it still doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve been wearing it for 2 weeks now and have only gotten it to read 2 nights of sleep. The info is amazing but if it doesn‚Äôt work then what‚Äôs the point? I tried to talk to customer service about the battery issue and they will only talk to my friend who originally purchased it. Understandable, but I still haven‚Äôt gotten anything out of this device. I‚Äôm happy it was a gift, a great gift, albeit unusable to me personally as the app and battery life need significant work in my opinion."
3,Itsbabaxo,"I just received the Oura ring as a present a few days ago. I am still getting used to the app etc. One thing I have noticed that I am not happy about is, not being able to log in my workouts. If I am paying $5.99 a month PLUS however much thing ring is. I should be able to log in my workouts! I wanted to log in my workout from yesterday but it won‚Äôt allow me? It only allows you to log in workouts day of. This is ridiculous since I am paying for the app and I tend to forget to log in this kind of information. I feel like the app needs to be updated and improve this issue. Thanks."
2,Adonai Soap,"I purchased my Oura ring a few months ago. I really liked the idea of it all. Not sure on the technology? The ring fits great on my pointer finger yet I get odd readings. It‚Äôll say I took naps when I don‚Äôt. I check my stats about an hour after waking, but it‚Äôll put my wake up time when I check the app? I can barely get 3 days out of the ring before needing to recharge. One big reason I got was for body temperature readings‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôll only tell me + or - not an actual reading. So I love the idea but not sure why I‚Äôm getting inaccurate readings? I have no issues paying a monthly fee for the app when my free 6 months are up. All in all comfortable ring. I regret getting it in black. I might get a silver one and gift this one away."
1,80Dub,I‚Äôve had my ring for 3 months.  It‚Äôs gotten my sleep correct hardly at all.  Throwing my numbers off.   I‚Äôve contacted Oura numerous times and they say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a bug we are fixing‚Äù. This week it‚Äôs missed my bedtime by over 3 hours almost each nigh.  I go to bed before 10 every night and it constantly registers 1am.  I‚Äôve contacted them numerous times.  It takes them days to get back and then give me the same answer everything time.  There‚Äôs a bug they‚Äôre fixing. I let them know my issues at the first week I‚Äôve had it. Same answer always. When i requested a refund they said it was beyond the 30 days so they said no and there‚Äôd be an update shortly.   Fast forward.  No update.    So disappointing.  I‚Äôm a PT and wanted to recommend this to my patients.   But sadly I cannot.
1,Ugh....rosetta,"After a month or so I tossed my Oura ring into my wife‚Äôs jewelry box. Oura‚Äôs app doesn‚Äôt integrate (much) with other health/work-out based apps and therefore it only gathers and/or shares a small portion of the data one needs to track in order to truly understand what ones body is going through. To get the best out of what the ring actually does, you have to wear the ring all day - even during workouts - which is disappointing. Would rather wear a robust heart rate monitor and watch and then have the data fully integrate with Garmin, Strata, Health, etc.... but it doesn‚Äôt.   Overall, wish the ring and app would gather the data it‚Äôs best at gathering, share the data with other apps, and pull data from other robust data sources in order to tell a better/fuller story. Until then - we‚Äôll wait for something better."
2,Watt rn,"I‚Äôve had my ring for over a year and loved it. Then all of a sudden the battery life started waning a lot, no big deal that happens. Now it doesn‚Äôt last 24 hours. I‚Äôve maybe had it for 18 months. The thing is that I can‚Äôt trade it in for an upgrade and can‚Äôt find customer support on their website nor does the website have any customer feedback. The app is very expensive and the basic or free version provides zero information. Since I‚Äôve had it so long I can use the free version. I get it takes money to fund the science but it‚Äôs very disappointing that the product has basically become useless in less than 2 years for a pretty steep ticket price."
3,Skacorin,"Love everything the ring offers, except when you have to delete and reinstall the app because it keeps instantly crashing when you try and open it, which of course means you have to reconnect the ring. So yea, that‚Äôs frustrating for the amount of money you pay for these rings. And you don‚Äôt even have a way to contact support directly through the website, which is dumb considering support can‚Äôt be contacted via the app when the app KEEPS CRASHING. Ugh‚Ä¶ As much as I love these rings, I may have to consider a refund on this Gen3. Consistent issues since I got it, whether the ring or the app. It‚Äôs very disappointing."
1,Prat trey,"The ring and app itself is great but the customer service is lacking to a degree that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them. I have had my original ring for 2 years and and purchased the Gen 3 in October to update my ring. It‚Äôs now late January and I still have not revived my order. With multiple reach outs in the past 6 weeks no one can tell me where it is in the process, I‚Äôm just getting automated responses I think. I‚Äôve also sent multiple request for my refund and have not reviewed a reply. I‚Äôm so disappointed because I was looking forward to the new ring, but a product is only worth what the customer service can provide. Sadly, I still have rate this company a 1 star. I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt have to take further steps to receive my refund."
5,madalion3333,"I got my ring a little over a year ago and love it! I‚Äôm so happy i can now sync it with Natural Cycles. I think it would be really cool if you could somehow sync the sleep data the ring gathers with an alarm app in real time so it can wake you up in your lightest sleep cycle. (E.g., if you want to wake up between 8&9, if you‚Äôre in your lightest sleep at 8:10 one day the alarm would go off then. If you‚Äôre in your lightest sleep at 8:50 the next day the alarm would go off then)"
5,truthspeaks1,"Step tracking was so far off that I found it worthless. When I opened the app, it took too long for the ring to sync with the app. The ring itself was still bulky after upgrading. The app displays a lot of useless data. I tried returning the ring under 30 days and the company refused because I exchanged the first ring that did not fit.  Update: the company made it right and accepted a refund. I changed the review to five starts because the company did the right thing."
5,Will A. from San Francisco,"I‚Äôm a terrible sleeper, I have been since I was a child. This app and the Oura ring have helped me to sleep better by giving me advice like ‚Äúnow‚Äôs a good time to get ready for bed by winding down‚Äù. It helps me see what positively impacts my ability to fall asleep and have restful sleep. I know this can help tons of people who struggle with sleep to wake up feeling refreshed and energized.  I live in California but travel internationally for work sometimes, and it helps me take care of my sleep and energy on these long journeys full of jet lag and sleeping on planes!"
1,Darian LA,A+ product F- customer service Good luck to you if anything goes wrong in your order process‚Ä¶ it takes them a month to get back to your issue and ultimately when I finally got a hold of someone they didn‚Äôt even correct the problem. I was a very early adopter but regret ordering the Gen3 as they don‚Äôt treat their loyal customers well. They advertised founding members a $50 discount and free lifetime membership and just completely ignored that campaign promise when processing my order. Charged me full price and then when I asked about it‚Ä¶ customer service ignored my request and by the time they got back to me after i messaged the service several times (26 days later) they responded saying the promotion had expired‚Ä¶ ridiculous.
3,dkamionk,"This is a generally good product but the tagging feature doesn't allow for any serious analytical value because you can't download the tagged data, you can only visually review it on graphs and only at a daily level. It strikes me that Oura gets more value from our tags than users do. Also, custom tags do not appear on the cloud application. I'm on an annual plan which renews in 10 months. I won't be renewing without serious improvements in the usability of tags. Also, the virtual assistant Finn is basically just a primitive search engine, very frustrating and unable to understand any context at all."
1,MathiasW,"Wearing my garmin watch and the ring at the same time while exercising, the ring shows my heart rate 50bpm below the watch. Going to bed and checking the clock, the ring shows that I went to bed 1:45 later than I did. Sleeping overnight, the ring shows that I was awake for two hours. I may have not slept well, but I would have noticed being awake for two hours. It‚Äôs hard to trust any data from the ring when it is verifiably that inaccurate. To make it worse, zero response after a week when I opened a ticket asking for help.  This thing is a rip off, avoid it at all costs!  And to the developer response, I already returned the ring, why would I want to pay so much money for bad data and terrible support?"
5,Jorgito el libre,"This ring gives you a very insightful info of your body, I gave away my apple watch because this is 10x better (yes, I dare to say it) starting from the long lasting battery to the HRV... there‚Äôs so many awesome things.  On the section where you specify your workout for the calories burnt. Would be cool to have [workout - job] for those of us whose jobs are physical. That way you can separate what was done under GYM, JOB, CYCLING, OTHER...    Ps. Just bought the ring 2 months ago, idk if you had that feature in the prev version and was deleted, I‚Äôm new here. Thanks."
5,Paukenmac,"I‚Äôve had my ring nearly three years. I‚Äôve learned so much about my sleep patterns and the effects my daily activities have on it. As a result of the feedback I‚Äôve gotten from the ring, I‚Äôve been able to increase my sleep from five hours a night to 6.5-7.5 a night. Service: After owning it just over two years, the battery began to fail‚Äîneeding to charge every day. I contacted Support through the app and had a replacement ring three days later. They have won my loyalty!"
4,Bugbegone,This app is really good at tracking the things it was meant to. The UI is very intuitive and among the best in its category. Everything is laid out to make it easy to drill down if you want. Or get an overview if you don‚Äôt.   One frustration is having to run the app manually every night before bed in order for it to import all activities recorded in the Health app. If you forget to run it the activity is not imported and thus not counted towards your daily activity. So the next day‚Äôs recommendation is off. This can be a hassle if you have a smart watch that you use for activities.   Hope they address it soon.
5,Meshachw,"After hearing some top sleep scientists, doctors, and health coaches talk about how powerful the Oura Ring is for improving sleep and health (not to mention the increasingly frequent studies on the power of sleep to prevent disease and boost mental health), I purchased the ring. After trying many quant devices I was naturally ready for disappointment. I‚Äôve been blown away at how powerful the ring has been in changing my life. It‚Äôs especially useful to identify behaviors that negatively impact sleep and to have more control over my sleep. Highly recommend."
5,Koala Dawn,"I have had an Oura ring since the second version (many years).  It is amazing when it can accurately predict any illness any morning before I get sick, before any symptoms that I can feel appear.  This helps me to not infect others, lay low, and start to prepare for what is brewing.  It also helps to target what affects my sleep quality and how much exercise and stress reduction I need that day.  So much good has come from this ring.  And it is much easier to sleep with than a bulky smart watch."
2,JMDien,"Product is decent, data seems mostly reliable, definitely expensive, but I submitted a bug ticket because a 45 minute afternoon nap increased my readiness and sleep score for that day AND the day after.  I included a screenshot.    Leo from customer support responded with some generic product marketing garbage, clearly not having read my problem description nor having tried to understand my issue.    Seriously?  For this expensive of a product?  Sadly my first experience is just like any other startup who has fake (or chat bot/automated) customer support because the bottom line is affected when they do actually care enough to read about and fix bugs."
4,Dr Aww,Overall I find the app helpful EXCEPT it uses incomplete information at time. For example I have charged the ring and forgotten it all night and also put n n n the middle of the night. In the first example it recorded that I slept 25 mnutes total and. Had a great night sleep but there is no way to correct that. In the second example it recorded 4 night sleep. AND both nights are factored into my overall data. There should be a way to fix errors ‚Ä¶.. VERY Frustrating. !  Also very difficult to get help with questions ‚Ä¶
1,Timer user 930,"Always have loved this ring and the app but today the app keeps crashing. When I try to bring it up it just turns off. I al Amy‚Äôs put the ring on airplane mode at night, then sinc in the morning. I just can‚Äôt get the app to stay up. I noticed that the app recently had an update. No longer works.  Stopped working on the evening of June 11. I updated my IOS , restarted my iPhone 8 max, and did a force restart. I went to support page and did everything that was suggested as well, still crashes. Also there is no way to contact support on the support page.   I have gen2 ring. I was considering getting the new gen3 ring. That is a problem with things that require an app. If the app does not work it is useless."
4,Cr0601,"I‚Äôve absolutely loved my Oura Ring and introduced friends to what the Oura Ring provides me. However, when the new Oura3 was released mine stopped working?  I upgraded my phone and thought it might be the issue but not true. I finally got it connected to my phone but the ring no longer was collecting my sleep or activity data. Service replied the first time right away but now due to a higher volume of inquiries. Now my ring wont connect or collect data.  I‚Äôm hopeful that Oura Service can turn this around for me. I purchased this ring November of 2020. Missing my Oura ring in 2022!"
1,CanIBFrank?,"TIP: SORT REVIEWS BY DATE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT ALL THE MOST RECENT REVIEWS ARE BAD. SOMETHING HAS GONE TERRIBLY WRONG AND THE COMPANY IS NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR CUSTOMERS OR THEIR PRODUCTS. STAY AWAY AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I‚Äôve had my ring for almost 2 months and the sleep data is useless to me. Sure, it may guess somewhat accurately for some kinds of sleep, but it absolutely can not distinguish between the most important nighttime states: whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. It consistently tells me I‚Äôm asleep when I know I‚Äôm wide awake. I can‚Äôt figure out what this device is good at, all the data is confusing and doesn‚Äôt correlate to my lived experience. I wish I could get my money back.  ************** Update: continued attempt to reach and hear from any human in customer service have been fruitless. Only bots respond. My data has grown more meaningless and even the app is contradicting itself. I get the impression there will be no support for Gen2 customers even those who bought shortly before the new Gen3 was announced. Bad business culture to dump customers like that. Purchase at your own risk- no company support for this product."
1,Sabrina Rowan Sexton,"I waited for years to buy an Oura ring because until recently the heart rate tracking for workouts was too infrequent to really capture your heart rate vs time.  But with the Gen 3 ring that changed and you can now ‚ÄúRecord Workout HR‚Äù and get a nice detailed graph of your heart rate over the workout start to finish, with average, minimum, and maximum shown on the graph!  Yea!  Until the update three days ago, that is.  Now, even if you record workout heart rate and use more battery to get detailed information, it no longer shows up in the workout report!  It‚Äôs just . . . gone.  All they have now is that stupid bar graph showing high, medium, low intensity vs time.  Even for my old, past, workouts, the information is gone.  So it‚Äôs not that my ring is malfunctioning.  I put in a ticket about this, but despite the promise that I would hear back in 24 hours, I have not.  I suspect it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù not a bug and that I will not hear anything.  For $6 a month for the app, this is a dealbreaker.  Fortunately for me, I‚Äôm still in the 30 day return window!  Goodbye, Oura ring."
4,Umichchs,"You really need an update to be able to delete imported data. If you use heart rate monitoring, and your workout is from an app synced with your Apple help (ie: peloton, strava, etc) then it double counts in the Oura app. Since there is no way to edit imported workouts there‚Äôs currently no way to remedy this, except for for turning off the sync and manually adding workouts you don‚Äôt use heart rate monitoring for. This is exceedingly silly and, from my research, seems to be a very common complaint. Kind of absurd not to have a fix for, given the cost of this product."
2,Bthueson,Upgraded to the new Oura ring 4 cuz of the new design and the interior nubs were a nuisance on the Oura ring 3. The physical design of the new ring is awesome. The connectivity of the new ring is terrible. I‚Äôve lost connectivity after a few days almost every time after establishing connection. And if I don‚Äôt have the harder handy I‚Äôm not able to reconnect the ring. Even when I do have the charger it takes multiple attempts to reconnect going to lengths of having to delete the app and reinstall it. Only having data available a few days at a time with major gaps defeats the entire purpose of the ring. Hopefully Oura can fix this issue asap!!
5,oneghing,"Love this little power ring way more than a watch or other bio reader. Why? Small. Good looking. Encouraging. Teaching. Keeps me in touch. For example, after a HII t workout the app said ‚Äú That was intense.‚Äù  After a restless night the app tracks what‚Äôs going on over time and gives me guilt free permission to take it easy in order to be focused. Told me what great resilience I have and how my heart age is. On and on w more precise details as we go along. A very sophisticated monitor and support device. As good as a wonderful coach. With me day and night."
4,eko2crossfire,"After having worn this product for several months now and testing it, yes it is great at what it does. But the value proposition of the subscription price is just not there. I think if they set the price to be $3-4/month, that would significantly increase the outlook towards the reasonableness of this product. In our subscription economy, this product can only justify higher prices if the multifunctional innovations occur (I.e: it has an ECG and a multi use button and blood sugar sensor etc) but I don‚Äôt see the innovations anytime on the horizon."
3,ManuelGonz2023,"This could be a much better product with just a few tweaks. Regularly misses naps, but impossible to add them manually - because we have an innovative nap tracking system that does not track your naps! Contacting support does not help either ‚Äì they could add a nap once but then mysteriously lost this ability. Now the ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù section of the app does not even load.  Bought the device for sleep tracking and it‚Äôs suboptimal at best. Disappointing but already just spent hundreds of $$$ on the device and the subscription, so will have to hang in here for a while‚Ä¶"
1,UToepea,"My app STILL crashes on opening. What‚Äôs the point? I used to be happy with this and was even contemplating upgrading to subscription but now it appears that even spending 300 plus dollars isn‚Äôt a good enough reason to keep the subscription free customers happy and if your original customer base isn‚Äôt important to you, why on earth would I invest more money on a continued basis? Businesses are so focused on getting a stream of money from us they are forgetting that if there is no customer referrals and word of mouth, NO ONE has a reason to initially buy a product.  Please appreciate the people who still invested 300 dollars, it is no small amount and way too much for a ring and a app that can‚Äôt open to Show you anything."
5,Kimeurie,"I wear my Oura ring every day and it has changed my life! I sleep better because Oura has shown me what my good cycles look like versus a bad night of sleep, so I can adjust my habits to set myself up for success. I also use during the day because the activity tracker is more accurate than others. I have tried all the other health trackers on the market and never saw the value in wearing them for more than a couple weeks. I have worn my Oura for over a year now every single day. A fan here for life."
4,"Hunter, Hunt, G","The bugfix was creating an account on my laptop as opposed to my phone‚Ä¶ odd. The good news is once the app is up and running it seems to work great! Sleep tracking is very accurate, and the built in meditation routines are very nice.  Old review: Got the latest Oura ring (gen 3). Using the app to set it up, says I need to verify email. Fill out all steps in the email, until it says I can customize my experience in the app. In the app it says my email cannot be verified‚Ä¶ completely unable to proceed. What a great $500 washer I bought, horrible first impression."
1,skutar,This is my second ring and I updated when they released the new style ring. Worked well for a while but‚Ä¶. No longer tracks sleep accurately. I get accurate info about 1 out 5 nights as far as I can tell. For example last night I fell asleep at 10 pm (as confirmed by my wife). The ring thinks I went to sleep at 2 am when I got up for a bathroom break. I understand minutes off or even an hour but when it‚Äôs consistently several hours that‚Äôs an issue Customer support was not helpful. It‚Äôs a bummer because it was sooo good at this. 2 stars because it used to be a very good tool.  Just changed to 1 star as it‚Äôs still not recording accurately as it once did.  Almost ready to give up on it.
5,jbl the doc,I‚Äôm on my 2nd OURA ring having upgraded from the original to Gen 3 a couple of years ago. Fabulous product. Have been having issue with battery length into this 2nd year of use daily (live I AZ desert heat!) and after significant decline in battery life the OURA group did some tests and decided to replace my ring free of charge ‚Ä¶ artery was not performing as usual. Wonderful response as to my problem and ideal solution to Maintain perfect function. This is why I have gifted both my kids the ring as well!!!
5,AECollegeInvestor,"I love the ring and the data. I have a very active lifestyle and the ring helps me determine if I‚Äôm over exercising or just sleeping poorly.   It would be AWESOME if you guys could add a feature where another person could Temporarily wear the ring and it doesn‚Äôt affect my baseline data. For example, my relative wanted to know about her sleep patterns. I gave her the ring to try it out, but it‚Äôs going to throw off my data. Please add a ‚Äúguest mode‚Äù or ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt count toward my data‚Äù feature."
4,Afloat000,"Overall I really like oura, the date is interesting and well presented. Sometimes I find the accuracy lacking but in most places that is easy to adjust manually. The one place that doesn‚Äôt work is the bedtime adjustment. I regularly go to bed and toss and turn trying to fall asleep for an hour or more, and then am surprised to find my latency at only 15 minutes with a great sleep score. Not being able to adjust bed time earlier means I‚Äôm missing critical data about those very long latency nights."
3,NotNewtonsApple,"This is a great app and product, but has some issues like data integrity. Oura refuses or can‚Äôt figure out how to sync sleep data which is how they calculate readiness and other scores.  This data doesn‚Äôt sync in the background and is prone to being lost along with any useful information it brings.  The fix is simply forcing sleep data to sync in the background, but Oura hasn‚Äôt figured out how to do this yet and as a result I have lost several days / trends of data/information.  I wish they could just implement this so that I could make use of the information I bought the right for."
1,Mr Pink...,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  After two weeks and putting up with idiotic permissions questions (can Oura use your GPS?! To‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ track your heart rate‚Ä¶?).   The developers of this ring have ruined a device. I had whoop for two years and was constantly jealous of my friends with Oura ring. Since the new update and the overhaul of the app I am now sad I purchased it.   It has only captures o2 saturation twice in two weeks (it‚Äôs a good ring fit), it does not capture my heart rate most of the day, and now it simply wont even connect to my phone. Sweet! I purchased a $399 ring with a subscription that LITERALLY doesn‚Äôt work after 2 weeks.   Now when I‚Äôm looking for support there‚Äôs ZERO customer support. So yeah. Unless you like the style of ring, and think it‚Äôs worth $399 don‚Äôt waste your money - because you should expect the thing to work.   To the devs - you know what you‚Äôve done. You know you‚Äôve ruined your product. And I bet my last dollar that your entire dev team was frustrated at the design changes.   What a shame. The best on the market becomes a waste of money."
5,Bridge337,What a wonderful way to improve your sleep. I‚Äôve worn it for three and a half years and it has helped me steadily improve the quality of my sleep and the amount I get. Great statistics to help me analyze what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not. A nightly score which boosts my intentions...and my spirits when I get a demonstrably good night‚Äôs sleep!  Now my husband is using it too. Has helped him address his sleep habits in a way that‚Äôs improved my sleep as well.   I cannot emphasize enough the value of good sleep to health and positive feelings...and Oura‚Äôs contributions in helping me optimize my own.
3,jalund33,"I purchased the Oura ring early 2022. The first ring I got died a month or two after purchase. Speaking with support they sent me two chargers over the course of a couple of weeks. Finally got rhe geeen light for a replacement ring after chargers were working properly and the ring wouldn‚Äôt hold charge.   Fast forward six months and now the app won‚Äôt launch and when it does, it crashes after a few minutes.   I love the idea behind the ring and body metrics, however there are some stability issues that need to be addressed regarding hardware and software."
4,Rellimlk,"If there was the ability to correct the bedtime manually so you could say 10:15 when it ‚Äúdetected ‚Äú 11:05 this would be A 5 star app. But you can‚Äôt, so only 4 stars for me since my main problem is how long it takes to fall asleep.   The ring and app are good overall and provide lots of different insights on temp, heart, and sleep quality. If you want to track the quality of your sleep or how well you STAY asleep, this has all the tools. However, it does not accurately capture bedtime (if you are a person who has trouble falling asleep) AND it does not allow you to edit it to be EARLIER‚Ä¶ you can only make it later.   Oura fails to count the first 30-45 min (or however long) of me TRYING to sleep. It‚Äôs like it just figures out when I actually (first) fall asleep and then retcons my bedtime to be 5 min before. This messes up the data on ‚Äúbedtime ‚Äú and ‚Äútime in bed‚Äù.   Otherwise great product/app."
5,VOICEOFHER,I bought this ring for my husband who would just never wear a watch‚Ä¶ and he is so interested in all of the good information and lessons he can learn to help keep him ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù‚Ä¶ thank you so much for giving him a reason to ‚Äúplay-interact‚Äù with a truly healthy lifestyle.   He ended up buying me one too and it sends info to my Apple health program too which is also insightful to review every once in a while‚Ä¶ but I enjoy utilizing the app and we compare our daily status several times a day.
1,Whatforchips,"Is the app itself for Oura ring good, sure but do not and I mean do not buy an Oura ring!!! An app is worthless without a working ring.  The battery life on this is a joke. After 6 months you will be lucky if it works for 2.5 days.  I purely use the ring to track my sleep and nothing else.  I use other devices for activity related tracking.  It looks like their customer service is out of United States.  It‚Äôs very clear no solution is provided but rather the same prepared communication is used.  Nothing was ever resolved for me.  Good luck to anyone that has this ring.  I have been using them for 3 years and it was never like this. It‚Äôs a good thing all types of new rings are coming out now."
1,rogrmcmahoney,"This app works perfectly when it measured sleep, heart rate, and HRV. Since they added the pink, stress bars, and the resilience stuff, it has become more and more useless, while having less and less of a correlation, with how I actually feel. Also, why does this Avenue start tracking your sleep as soon as it‚Äôs midnight, even on the weekends? It‚Äôs insulting to receive pushy advice to go to bed earlier on my days off. Instead of adding libraries of beginning level, annoying, mindfulness recordings, how about lowering the price of the subscription? for a ring that costs hundreds of dollars, I just want it to work to track my health as it did when I purchased it. The simpler this app was, the better."
5,Andrey_Karpov42,"First, I have been a big fan of this product overall ever since I got it almost a year ago. I have always been obsessed with understanding sleep and have been very happy with the data and actionable information Oura gives me every day. One feature I have missed and asked for was treating daytime naps like sleep by providing sleep data and applying naps to the readiness and sleep scores. I am so excited to see that the latest updates have made this happen! Thank you, Oura!"
4,Tvegas99,"I‚Äôd like to give this ring and the app five stars, as there are many positive attributes.  But I still feel like some work needs to be in done to improve the app and the ring.  Either the app or the Ring are inaccurate maybe 10% of the time, maybe a little less at 5%?   For example, I could go on a 20 mile bike ride and I know 100% it‚Äôs 20 miles and the ring only gives me credit for 10 miles.  Also, I could go on a run for 3 1/2 miles and I know it‚Äôs a 3 1/2 mile run but I only get credit for 2 miles.  The problem is there is no way to edit your workout, I can‚Äôt go into my 10 mile bike ride and edit it to 20 miles. It‚Äôs not possible based on the apps locked fields.  The ring is super comfortable and the charge on it lasts forever. I‚Äôve become a healthier person since owning the ring. I hope we can make these last final improvements so I can have a five star experience!!"
2,gyammine,"Usually a solid app, no issues but I must say it‚Äôs been days now that the app crashes on open. Literally opens and immediately flashes and closes back to iOS Home Screen. Searched online and saw many users reporting this. As a mobile developer I‚Äôm shocked they‚Äôre not seeing these crashes in their monitors, releasing a hot fix or rolling back. Just want to be clear I love the product but this is uncharacteristic of the app based on my experience Edit: It‚Äôs possible the app is crashing before their crash/error analytics even loads and they‚Äôre totally blind to what is happening. Hope y‚Äôall notice this and fix it soon"
5,MarkGWilder,"I was an early adopter and have owned an Oura ring for a few years. My original decision on Oura was because I knew wearing a watch or something else on my wrist would disrupt my sleep, ruining a big part of the concept.  I‚Äôm constantly amazed by the metrics, and insights into my own health that the Oura ring provides daily. Oura also updates consistently adding features and not standing still with their technology. Their customer service listens and responds. What more could you ask for."
4,Ephhhy,"I love the concept, and the app is not bad either. I bought it to track my sleep habits. I often wake up in the middle of the night and stay up for 20-30 minutes before returning to sleep, but the ring will no longer count that second period. There is no option to track a power nap either. It would be great to set the time that you plan to stay asleep each night (11-7, for example), comparing it to the actual result.  Looks like the app started tracking/adding sleep hours better. I added a star because I love the minimalistic concept."
1,Wanderluster2,"After having a poor night‚Äôs sleep, waking up around 4, I went back to sleep from 5 - 6:30. I‚Äôm sure I was asleep because I was dreaming! That last bit of sleep never got recorded. Apparently this is a known issue posted on their site since May. Hello? Oura? You‚Äôre a sleep tracking company and you can‚Äôt get this basic function right?  Don‚Äôt get me started about how I was held hostage into paying the subscription rate on my Gen3 ring after my Gen1 and then Gen2 rings stopped charging. $300+ and a subscription on top of that? And the data is no longer accurate?   Go elsewhere if you‚Äôre looking for a sleep tracker. I wish I had before making this ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù in my health."
2,Brandon05301983,"Extremely poor customer support. Oura informed me that my Gen 3 ring that is under a year old is not available to be replaced under warranty even though it only now suddenly gets 2 days of battery life. I was also told by their own customer service team that it‚Äôs a known issue but a software related one, but this was only mentioned to me after I said ‚Äúcould it be a software issue?‚Äù Feels like a way to scam me out of providing a new ring.  However, even if that‚Äôs actually the case no solution to the problem was offered and I was essentially told I would need to deal with it. I would not recommend Oura in any way."
3,cloe22c,"I‚Äôve had my Oura ring for about 3 years now. I have cared for it and love using it. As the device is a bit old now, the charge only lasts about 3days & two nights. Unfortunately, despite having all my notifications turned on, and settings corrected as instructed by Oura I have trouble receiving notifications to charge my ring. If I don‚Äôt remember to log into my app just before bedtime, I don‚Äôt receive my reminder to charge my ring. I have reached out to Oura regarding this and they have been very helpful, but unfortunately I still find this to be to be annoyance"
1,Doc Spartacus,"The new design is absolutely horrible. My Oura was my go to for fitness and wellness tracking as it was more accurate than my Apple Watch or anything else I had. Currently training for triathlon season and for 3 years the ring was great with assisting. Since the update the ring no longer tracks any activities except for sleep. Used to detect and record activities very well, and extremely accurately. Yes, all of my setting are correct. But when I train for a few hours a day I have to enter everything in manually, maybe I‚Äôll get a message to confirm my activity and it shows ‚Äúhousework‚Äù for a few mins.  Please change this back to something functional again."
5,Hope_RSA,"I have learned so much from my Oura ring. I was shocked to learn how drinking raises my heart rate and how it stays elevated for hours after I‚Äôve stopped. It‚Äôs been eye opening to learn how my body reacts to various situations, people, and environment and it‚Äôs more responsive and accurate than my Apple Watch for measuring various sleep criteria. It alerts to trends that it detects and offers suggestions for improvements. I highly recommend Oura for anyone wanting to be more in touch with their body and overall wellness."
5,dn 4242,"Was going to do usual update, ring and app are working fine. Thought i wiuld check reviews/info just to see what is new in app.  Seems like recent updates have been horrible and completely disabling the ring/app.  So i will not update until the situation is brought under control.  5 stars bcs it is working for me and has for years--but a 2 minute update could drive it to one after an hour of frustration--which is apparent in reviews."
2,LRoddi,"I got the Oura Ring because it is lovely not to have a screen buzzing to tell me about my phone messages, it is stylish, and it tracks health metrics in a more advanced way than other companies/tech. I love the ring and what it can do. However, I have real difficulty with the app. In my opinion is is not intuitive, the graphs are confusing and do not easily and clearly tell me what I want to know over time. I am also very used to graphs and data because of my research degree. I have heard this frustration from many other people as well.   It makes me sad because I love the ring but I greatly dislike the set up of the app. So, I am looking back to my Fitbit to have a more meaningful interaction with my data and to track my health stats (it just can‚Äôt track what the Oura ring can).  Oura ring can you fix this please? I don‚Äôt want to go back to my Fitbit but I am really frustrated with your app. Can you make your app more like Fitbit or Apple?   Thank you"
5,Overnightwalker,"People use their Oura rings for a lot of things. For me, I always check when I wake up to see my temperature and respiration numbers. If I'm feeling fine, but one or both is off, I take it easy. If I do get sick, those numbers change before I'm aware of it. If I do get sick, I watch them to show improvements before I feel them myself.  THANK YOU for the new built-in ring finder! I lost my ring once and this would have made it so much easier to find."
5,Shebeme486,Initially when I got ring app with constant crashes and freezes . App showed NO data despite troubleshooting per Oura website instructions. Constant ‚Äú Updating‚Äù blue scroll bar across the screen whenever I opened the app. Suddenly about 26+ hours after wearing that blue ‚Äú updating‚Äù bar completed and was promoted to update firmware. After that data appeared and app no longer crashes. Glad it‚Äôs working now but unclear why the update took so long.
5,Boozi2,"I‚Äôve been using Oura ring for almost a year now, in which I wore it continuously and only took it off for a few days. The guys at Oura did a great job, their ring is great and it monitors sleep better then all other devices (Apple Watch, mi band etc..). The app is also great, very addictive, makes me check it first thing when I wake up to see my sleep analysis. An important insight I got from it was to shift my workouts from night to morning, giving my body time to lower my pulse and recover during the night. üëè"
2,Jn_na,"I miss being able to quickly swipe back on previous days to see my overall progress on sleep or activity. I go to bed after midnight and I like to review my day before I go to sleep, but now, because it‚Äôs technically yesterday, I have to click into different metrics one at a time, so no real easy holistic view :/ feels harder to compare things this way.   I don‚Äôt care for the timeline element and it actually stresses me out a little! Makes me feel like a Sim. at least give us the option to customize our widgets and toggle things off if you‚Äôre going to make it like this üò≠"
2,Lms4563,"First, you can only use the app on one device. I have an iPad and iPhone that I typically use interchangeably during the day and evening. It‚Äôs inconvenient to not have the app sync between the two devices. Second, I‚Äôve had to reload the app at least five times since I stared using the ring in December, so about three months. The data it collects is useful and interesting to watch day to day. The ring isn‚Äôt the issue here, it‚Äôs the app and its ability to be reliable. Since you need the app with the ring, I guess I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the Oura ring until the app becomes more reliable and user friendly."
4,care2191,"I can not easily contact the company to give feedback so I will just put my issues here.   When I am sanding wood it registers as high intensity exercise.  It would be nice to have a way to take erroneous data out.  Really messes up any stats.       Also when I say other for type of exercise, it registers later as cycling.  I want to be able to specify my workout.   The sleep data they say is 80 percent accurate which is good.  But it says sometimes I was in deep sleep when I was watching TV.    However, overall I really enjoy it and the upgrades over the last year oxygen saturation, and recording HR while working out were great additions.  The readiness score accurately reflects what I can expect that day.  I have a more objective way to measure any changes I make n my lifestyle.    I would appreciate if the team would fix these issues in a future upgrade."
5,SKurddd,"The app is very user friendly and has a nice layout. I‚Äôve never experienced any bugs or trouble syncing my data. I love the graphs and you can see your weekly trends. Overall, the ring is non invasive which is why I chose to buy it rather than a watch. It‚Äôs lightweight and you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre wearing it. Also, I believe the tech behind the ring is stronger than the watches. I‚Äôm excited about the new period tracking feature as well!"
4,lorn44,"I like the functionality of the app overall, but what I‚Äôd really like to have is real-time reads of my temperature, stress level, etc and notifications when these things change. E.g. a notification when my stress level is rising, or a notification that my temperature is up and what that might mean. This is what I expected when I bought the ring. Please work on this update!  I think it would be a game changer and dramatically increase sales (I know I would start recommending it a lot more!)"
3,jd2020,"Oura ring is great. Subscription is poor. The app is a mix of great, lame, and neglect. Great for display of ring data, and gets better. Lame for nagging me with blue dot to ‚Äúrefer a friend‚Äù every few weeks: bad experience. Neglect is the word for the meditations provided. No change since they were into‚Äôd years ago. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt care in this area. The audio levels vary, the content is mostly disappointing, and there‚Äôs no previews or any way organize the few good ones. you‚Äôre left with memorizing or guessing. Maybe just remove the mediations if you‚Äôre not going to take seriously."
1,Une Belle,"Beware that the app is faulty and the company has poor customer service. For example, I contacted the customer support for assistance with troubleshooting the restorative feature and they still didn‚Äôt help. They advised to uninstall and reinstall the app even after I just told them I already tried that method and it didn‚Äôt work. To this day, I still have issues with the restorative feature and this company refuses to fix the issue in their end.   The app doesn‚Äôt accurately record data for sleep and rest which are the main reasons for purchasing the device and using this app.  While the app looks great and has some cool features, it loses all of its potential when it constantly glitches or doesn‚Äôt accurately record data as advertised. It creates more stress to constantly troubleshoot functionality than I would have if I just didn‚Äôt use this app.   Definitely make sure to check out Ouras instagram page to read the comments before purchasing the device based on this app alone."
2,Paulc1978,"Overall I‚Äôm happy with the Oura ring as I‚Äôve been a user since series two and upgraded to series three with a lifetime membership. The sour grapes from people not knowing that most tracking wasn‚Äôt included with the membership that was announced almost two years ago is not Oura‚Äôs fault. However, this recent update added what I can only call Clippy for Oura. It is huge and blocks data on the screen and makes the app look unprofessional. I went to my settings to try and hide it and it‚Äôs not possible. This needs to be able to be removed or completely  scrapped from the app."
3,theflyingcupcake,"I love nearly everything about this app, except the fact that it wants to track my location 24/7. Even when I have location tracking set to ‚Äúonly while using the app‚Äù, I see the location tracking icon light up in the status bar no matter what app I‚Äôm currently looking at‚Ä¶.and it always points back to Oura. It‚Äôs a privacy concern, as well as a drain on my phone battery. I‚Äôve disabled location tracking entirely for this app now, but it makes me worry about what else they‚Äôre needlessly tracking."
5,dookfnp2,I used to track my sleep with my iPhone which did not give me any insight and was marginal at best. The developers of this ring have gone far above and beyond. This ring knows when I get up to go to the bathroom in the night! I KNOW it WORKS because I know exactly when I go to bed and when I get up. And this thing nails it! I love my oura! The only thing I would love it to do that it doesn‚Äôt is pulse oximetry. I‚Äôm sure they are working on this. This would highly benefit those with sleep apnea or with an illness such as COVID. Thanks for this ring!!
5,flawlessmelody,"I‚Äôve been using the Oura Ring for a while now, and I absolutely love it. It helps me track my stress, breathing, temperature, and sleep daily, giving me a clear picture of how I‚Äôm feeling and what adjustments I need to make. The insights are incredibly helpful for staying in tune with my body.  One area for improvement would be the battery life‚ÄîI wish it lasted longer between charges. Overall, it‚Äôs been a fantastic tool for tracking my health and well-being."
1,LoneWolfo6,"This company is terrible, their app is very limited and does not have features like Withings, Whoop, or Fitbit. Basic feedback and the rat tracker is inaccurate.   I purchased my Oura ring less than a year ago and it used to last 5-6 days on one charge, several months go by and woke up one day and charge wax only lasting 2-3 days. 8 customer service inquiries later in past two months and ring is only lasting 1.5 days before needing charged. Oura says it‚Äôs their firmware draining battery. But it probably faulty battery in the ring?!  Here is my cookie cutter customer service response:   In full transparency, our firmware team is doing everything possible to bring battery life back to your ring. We are constantly improving our firmware updates, which will fix a few bugs that contribute to battery drain. Still, this process can take time, and we genuinely appreciate your patience as we work toward a solution. While we are working on these bugs, you may have to charge your ring more often."
3,mcguitarguy,"I had an Oura ring that I was generally quite happy with last year. Then the sales pitch came about adding pulse oximetry functionality, and a new fee-based app. But wait! If you upgraded your ring right now you could forego the fee-based app service for life. Well six months later, the ring I bought to boost Oura‚Äôs holiday sales numbers still has not had the pulse oximetry software update. Shame on me for taking the bait. Bottom line‚Äî the ring I had would have provided the same functionality as I‚Äôve gotten out of the new one I shouldn‚Äôt have bothered with."
3,ckosel,"This is undoubtedly a fine product, and many new features have been added since I started using it. Unfortunately this has all been at the expense of battery life. When I first started using it, I could wear it 2-3 days without a charge. Now, after missing a number of nights tracking, it needs charging every day or it dies in middle of the night and you lose valuable information. Additionally alerting is not robust and fails to warn you of the fact. I would strongly suggest a pause in development to see how this can be addressed"
5,Papaquito,"Subscription model with a free trial that starts a) before all features are even available and b) when simple base features (like activity tracking) has known bugs that prevent the app from counting the activity it imports from Apple Health even though you can clearly see that the app imported the data.   Fix your bugs, roll out your features, and then start the timer on the free trial. Sounds like a good concession for a $300+ device."
3,agal007,"I enjoy my Oura, everything from the style to how simple it is to use, how quickly it charges and how long the battery lasts. However, the app could definitely deliver more insights.   For example: -  an ability to compare days weeks, months, all data to show trends or for comparison - my sleep cycle app does this - Apple‚Äôs Health App shows trends on its own by comparing data over weeks, months, a comparison to the same time in the last year etc.  These are fairly simple analyses and I‚Äôm surprised it doesn‚Äôt already offer them."
1,ari_sassfrass,I like many others had the Gen2 and decided to upgrade to Gen3. It should have been a red flag to look into other devices when the data I used to get for free was going to a subscription model. I did not have the ring for long when the battery totally crapped out and the ring is not useable. I didn‚Äôt even have it long enough to gage it‚Äôs accuracy. I‚Äôve emailed customer service and - like so many others - am waiting. And waiting. And waiting for a resolution. And I can‚Äôt go back to my Gen2 because I sent it back to them. Now reading all the reviews it makes sense and if I don‚Äôt hear back from them soon I‚Äôll be disputing the purchase through the bank.
5,jjtadd,"I have been an avid user of the Oura ring for well over a year and so has my wife. We are SO very pleased with this ring and all that it does; it not only provides your overall health and fitness data, it literally gives you suggestions to improve your overall wellness! Truly love all the features INCLUDING (but not limited to) Oxygen Saturation data and body temperature‚Ä¶ Stylish and so VERY functional!! A real health tracker!!"
1,Ksc6000,"You can‚Äôt even slide your thumb over the sleep stages or heart rate, HRV graphs to see the specific times in the night, unlike EVERY other sleep app! Also, you can‚Äôt simply swipe back and forth on the sleep/readiness screens to switch between days to compare, you have to grab the day at the top of the screen, except for the home tab which you can - so inconsistent and terrible design. Hasn‚Äôt improved in over a year! And the useless reps tell you to use the website for a ‚Äúmore detailed‚Äù view - until you find out that the numbers between the app and the website don‚Äôt match, and then they tell you the website is in ‚Äúbeta‚Äù - where it‚Äôs been stuck forever. Terrible, don‚Äôt buy their products."
4,Zen Masta Flash,"I‚Äôm writing this after the fifth time in recent memory that I‚Äôve had to delete and reinstall the app because it will automatically close when I open it. Problem stops when i redownload, but that requires re-pairing your device, logging in, etc and that‚Äôs a big headache when I am looking, most of the time, to see the quick snapshot of how i slept.  I still live the product but worth pointing out that the app has some flaws and is still remarkably unstable"
4,JazzyLadyG,"I like the info provided but it is not aligned with other activity trackers. I think the thing I like the most is that it isn‚Äôt intrusive, doesn‚Äôt require daily charging and I can still wear my Apple Watch.  I don‚Äôt think it is worth $300+ especially with the size specific charger. (What‚Äôs up with that ??? - you could‚Äôve made one charger and included the sizers to make the ring stay in contact with the charger) I bought two different sizes and now I‚Äôm stuck with one that just does not work for anyone."
2,ddt32480,"You can get any smart ring cheaper that has all of the same features &&& use the app for free. When buying the ring it says order a half a size bigger but it‚Äôs more like 1 size bigger because it‚Äôs so tight. I do enjoy wearing the ring, even though it is bulky. I did enjoy the menstrual cycle tracking feature. It was spot on for the first three months. When my period was late it seemed very confused and kept pushing my period dates back. How does it work for pregnant women? I received this as a gift, but I would not buy it for myself because it is not the most cost effective."
4,MatthewEMay,"Oura needs connect with other apps that are far more accurate in terms of heart. I wear an HRM and not only does this ring come nowhere close to true heart rate for activities like cycling, often off by 15-20 bpm, but there is no way to connect with the apps that do, like Wahoo. It needs a learning and calibration function. Given the state of AI, this is entirely within reason. It would be a 5-star app and device if it did. Until then, 4 stars (80 out 100) is the most I can give."
3,SailorGirl 3,"I wear my ring 24/7, except when charging. The feedback is great, and mostly accurate. I do need to edit activities quite often (it doesn‚Äôt recognize less common ones like kayaking or paddle boarding), but the thing that bugs me most is the ability to edit and customize:  1.  Sleep tracking. If I leave my ring on the charger overnight, I can‚Äôt edit my sleep time. Then for the next several days it tells me I need to alter my sleep patterns, so it makes their algorithm useless to improve my health. 2.  Stress. It tells me I‚Äôm stressed when I‚Äôm not, and says I‚Äôm not resilient. I don‚Äôt want to see that - it makes me feel badly about myself when things are going well. The right is supposed to make me feel better, not worse about myself.  I think our tracked data is more important to their business than actually coaching us users. It‚Äôs frustrating."
3,Himeros44,"I love the Oura ring and the Oura app, the features are great and I can almost always count on it to let me know when I need to take it easy or when I‚Äôm getting sick.   The ring itself is beautiful, reliable, and and has great battery life.  The software / service has amazing features, UI, and content but needs a crucial update. One big miss for the app is outdated HealthKit integration. I use health kit to store all my health metrics, and Oura syncs sleep but not sleep stages.  Health kit supports sleep stage tracking  since iOS 16 was released but Oura does not upload the data to HealthKit."
5,douggiedice,"I have to be honest the ring works so well when it comes to sleep data. I really use it for that exclusively. As far as tracking workouts, I find it to be very weak. I can do a two hour workout and it will not even pick up the workout. So to me I‚Äôm only giving it five stars because of how well it does for sleep. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs better technology out there now. But for the price I paid. I‚Äôm sticking with it for now."
1,joeupchurch,"I spent the not insignificant sum required to own an Oura ring and try this out because I really wanted something to track my daily activity and sleep without having to always wear an Apple Watch. This device tracks these things beautifully but the developers absolutely refuse to write the step data to my Health app so I can‚Äôt incorporate the information without daily manual intervention. If this device cannot replace my existing tracker, it‚Äôs a useless addition. Simple fix, but this company refuses to make their device actually useful unless you give in to living only inside their app. I won‚Äôt be extending my subscription and throwing good money after bad."
4,Spletz,"I love the ring and the insights it gives. I am sleeping better and my activity is way up. You can‚Äôt lie to this thing.   Only reason it‚Äôs not a 5 star review is that there is no feedback whatsoever. No reminders to stand/breathe etc but the thing I wish it had lost was a simple haptic feedback - ie vibration. Vibration would allow it to wake me at the right moment in my cycle or little reminders.   Aside from that, once you accept this is a great sensor only, it does its job very very well."
5,gavparkour2018,The ring with eyes üëÄ showed up on this app when I was logging my sleep score in this app and the next day it was back to normal ü§îin my mind it‚Äôs a great üëç idea for people who don‚Äôt like the small button to click on to record their progress. I think this oura ring company should give this as an option when setting up a newer ring or current ring in the settings in future updates.
3,AJ Bello,"Oura is saying that I have great sleep quality, (good news!) but unfortunately it gives me a readiness for the day of ‚Äúgood‚Äù when in fact I did not get enough sleep (I need 9-10 hours typically) and feel absolutely terrible all day, whether or not my sleep quality was good.   Could there be an algorithm update to either manually input a sleep duration goal or ‚Äúhow we feel during the day?‚Äù option?   I might just be out of it and tired, but it‚Äôs really frustrating to see a ‚Äúgood‚Äù readiness score when I feel terrible all day."
3,"Great, but stopped working","I LOVED my oura ring so much. The insights, the step counting ect. But one day, my ring simply stopped connecting. I tried every single trouble shoot and it would not connect to the app. I had had it for like 3 months at this point. The excellent customer service team sent me a replacement at no cost which was amazing, only the problem persisted. So now I have 2 3rd gen Oura rings that both will not connect to my phone but are in perfect condition:( It makes me so sad but i'm not sure if anything can be done."
1,Mikhail beg,"I recently updated my firm ware and it‚Äôs made no difference. It‚Äôs been a complete waste of my time. I can‚Äôt check a single thing - sleep, steps, etc - because it doesn‚Äôt synchronize properly. I looked back at the past month, and it‚Äôs updated/synchronized less than 25% of the time. Even the days that are updated, the numbers are significantly off. For example, this Sunday my wife and I walked around Holland Farms, then walked around one of New Jerseys biggest temples: her ring has 19k steps and over 11.1 miles, while mine has 2.5 miles and 4K steps. Neither seems accurate, but the discrepancy between those numbers is a little ridiculous."
5,iamh2o,"I am beyond thrilled with Oura. The number of metrics this ring captures is impressive & because the ring can last a week before needing to be charged, I get far more data than  other wearables ( ie Apple Watch which tends to be charging overnight). Something I did not anticipate was being able to clearly see the negative impact smoking was having in my health. These data absolutely contributed to my finally quitting smoking."
1,kingofbanff,The nap functionality is no longer working after the update so ignore the fact that I said it was useful 30 to 40% of my sleep is comprised of naps. So before they added this the ring was useless to me. But now that the app is added in it makes it a useful device for me. Just for fun I wore two different rings one night. One synced to my phone and one to my wife‚Äôs phone. They were off by about 20%. So definitely take everything the app tells you with a grain of salt.   So the ring has actually got worse over time. And now they want $300 for the new one +6 dollars a month.  Complete waste of money. If anybody wants to buy mine for $10 let me know.
5,Whoseit,"The Oura has given me a level of insight into the quality of my sleep that I never imagined possible. Combined with the insights it offers into where and how I can benefit from improvement, it has driven a profound improvement in quality of life in terms of mood, emotional regulation, stress management and cognition. I recently upgraded to the generation 2 and have been very happy with that as well.  I can‚Äôt recommend this product enough."
2,847Chitown,"I love the wearability aspect of the Oura ring but the app leaves the simplest functionality to be desired. You cannot add workouts even the following day. I find this really basic, the app should enable me to manage my data in the easiest way possible, especially if it‚Äôs expected to pay for the app. We all have busy lives. This needs to be fixed. I cannot zoom in on hear rate or step count. The ring does not pick up on stationary workouts, such as walking at a desk, which is understandable and ok. However, if using a different device, I cannot add step count, just the activity."
2,random human avitar,"I bought this specifically to track my sleep, and measuring with this metric, 2 stars is the best I can give.  Watching tv on the couch often gets lumped into sleep when I am very much awake but not moving around.  If I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping, being stationary is enough to register that I‚Äôm in light or rem sleep.  Unfortunately, nobody responds to email requests quick enough to return the product in its painfully short 30 day return window.  Maybe someday they will allow for better heart rate customization, but as it stands, this is not a real world sleep tracker."
3,Phoenix767,"The Ring works well and about an 80%-95% accuracy for my daily activity and sleep, so I‚Äôm pleased‚Ä¶so far.  I run and walk for cardio exercise and don‚Äôt like bringing my bulky iPhone with me when I exercise.  My Apple Watch has cellular service so I don‚Äôt miss calls or text.  However, the Oura Ring requires that you have your phone with you in order to track your back movement on the map.  I have the Strava app but it only pulls my vitals and not my track onto the Oura app.  It would be amazing to have an Oura watch app so I could leave the phone behind."
2,CBrodi,"To focus on one good thing, Oura just sent an email to customers that there will be a significant update in June 2022 to address a range of issues that currently come across as feature gaps and measurement errors.  My subscription expires around that time and I‚Äôve lost so much trust in the app and its measurement that I‚Äôm considering going back to my Apple Watch or the Whoop.   Oura ring misses workouts like running or elliptical, but then after a shower sends me a push to confirm a workout. I mean I take exfoliating seriously, but it‚Äôs not a workout üò≠ (yes, that‚Äôs a real use case).  Trust is Oura‚Äôs currency, unfortunately infrequent useful updates paired with a marketing promise of a super-sized future update feels like the Product Management arm of the business isn‚Äôt meeting expectations or addressing user needs in a timely manner with research and empathy. All you have after a purchase is trust, which is currently a broken  user journey."
5,Mandaisageek,"I initially got my ring to help monitor recovery and sleep to ensure my workout schedule didn‚Äôt cause exhaustion and illness.  Not only has my ring helped me learn how much recovery I need (way more than I was taking), it has helped me go from 7 min deep sleep to just over an hour!  Low sleep score was actually not because of my sleep hygiene - it was hormonal imbalance (low thyroid) and the ring is still helping monitor when I need adjustments!  Knowing when to let up in activity really helps prevent weeks off of weights rather than a day or two.  The heart rate tracking is currently helpful in tracking down cause of irregular heart rhythm that I developed (heart rate and HRV started changing before irregular rhythm)  Can‚Äôt say enough how much this ring helps me manage my health!!"
1,BodyByBuddha,"I was gifted a gen3 ring last year and the fam was super stoked about it.  TBH I was too, at least during the trail membership.  According to their site:   ‚ÄúNon-paying members have access to 3 simple daily scores: Sleep, Readiness, and Activity, as well as our interactive and educational Explore content.‚Äù  IMHO - one should probably lead with that statement.  Or at least make it mush more prominent when making a purchase decision.   If you do not have a subscription the ring is basically useless for most proposes. The app won‚Äôt even push the data it‚Äôs gathering to Apple Health without the membership.   Expensive lesson learned on our part. If you get the subscription, you‚Äôre good to go. If you want to eliminate another subscription from your life - look elsewhere.    I joke with my family that I could use the ring in the ring sizing kit as it has as much functionality as the real ring without the subscription ‚Äî and it cost a whole heck of a lot less!"
1,Catnyc704,"I have the newest generation of this ring and it is extremely disappointing. Whenever I exercise, even if it is just walking, the ring is unable to record my heart rate. I have tried several times to reach out to customer service‚Äîthere is no phone number, only an email‚ÄîI get zero response.  I had heard good things about the ring beforehand but I do not recommend this at all. I have a couple of friends who also have the same problems w the heart rate monitor and lack of customer service so I am not alone! I never write reviews this is just so disappointing and too expensive to let it slide."
1,dddbton,I purchased the Oura ring gen 3 in October this year. The ring and app are very exceptional. However the ring ended up being slightly too tight for my desired finger as well as the fact they came out with the new Gen 4 a month after.  I returned my ring with plans to purchase the new model in a size up and have had terrible customer support getting my refund(still no refund) and even getting timely responses from anyone in support.  I‚Äôm super upset about this whole situation because I genuinely liked the product and software but not sure if I even want to support them after this and still not revived my refund.
5,Bullethead1,"I‚Äôve been with ≈åura for 3 years and it‚Äôs had a major impact on my life. Learning how to sleep better has improved my health and performance. I travel all the time for work and the time zone changes wrecks my body readiness but ≈åura helps me navigate the changes, making me recognize when it may be best to relax and not shame myself  into a work-out. Sleep quality matters.  Great technology and I will remain a customer."
5,henry- phillip,"I received my ring for my birthday in April and I‚Äôm already thrilled with it! I have had some medical challenges and was very surprised when my ring told me I had a fever when I did. It told me I should rest and recover. Love it! However, can you give me an estimate for when you‚Äôll upgrade to the SPo2 monitor? I appreciate that the ring doesn‚Äôt just record physical activities but it helps me stay in tune to what my body is doing. Thank you, Deb"
5,ORIO11,I really enjoy the oura ring and the features it provides. Its super comfortable and the data they provide gives good insight and is digestible.   Excited for what else they are going to add or improve.   The $6 membership is a bit more than I would like to spend after spending 400 but Its understandable given this is the ring is the focus of the entire company and not just one of their products.
1,DocAl DDS,"Ordered a new Gen 3 to replace my Gen 2 which worked flawlessly and when a problem, tech support got back to me within hours, not weeks ( now experience). Get multiple emails for sales, but this device only could be set up on my iPad, and then only work for a day. Never could get it to sync with my phone. Followed instructions to the tee several times. Technical support  does not respond to inquiries other than a canned approach which was no help whatsoever. My assumption is they rolled this out before the glitches were worked out, so they could get as many end of year sales as possible, quality be damned."
2,anupnair,"I was one of those who bought the first Gen ring via Kickstarter. Used it for a few years and saw the company through several years of the app. Finally bought the second Gen ring. That‚Äôs when the real view of customer service started becoming visible. They sent me the wrong colour and I chased them many times to get it exchanged, even wrote to the CEO. No luck. Finally had to call the card company and dispute and reverse the charge. Nothing from the service teams yet. Maybe they are doing too well to bother about a few customers."
3,AGS007X,"I‚Äôm very happy with my Oura Ring 4 and the amazing features it offers for tracking my body metrics. The app is fantastic in terms of data and usability, but I have a request: could you please enable a Pure Black mode? My phone is set up in this theme, and it would be ideal if the app could match that aesthetic. The current dark tones still have some brightness that I find uncomfortable. A fully black mode would greatly improve the experience for those of us who prefer a truly dark look. Thank you!"
3,nahnick,"Switching between days takes too many taps, the old interface allowing you to easily change days has for some reason been taken away.  Not sure why the app change was explained as making things easier when in actually makes things more obscure. Please expand the group that tests these major changes because this feedback should have been easily attainable with a proper UI/UX feedback process.   The gen 4 hardware though is outstanding."
5,Jaiden Patel,"I love the app. The only issue i‚Äôve had so far is activity data does not update in the app unless I open it that day. For example, I use my Apple Watch to track workouts into the Health and Activity apps, but if I don‚Äôt open Oura before I go to bed, it will not sync and will say I had virtually no activity that day. I just turned on Background App Refresh, so maybe that will fix the issue. Other than that, phenomenal app!"
2,Reviewer App Store,"Whether it was a software update to the app, firmware update to the ring, or quality of the battery, my ring now lasts around 2 days in airplane mode after having it for just over a year.  I highly suspect this is why the warranty doesn‚Äôt cover batteries because it‚Äôs clear the battery health of the ring is seriously degraded.  It‚Äôll jump from 75% to 100% in the app, and constantly change by large percentages because the battery is essentially toast.  What‚Äôs the point if you have to buy a new replacement ring every 1.5 years?"
3,Citrus C.,I‚Äôve had the Gen 3 Heritage Stealth for 4 months now. The finish showed blemishes within 2-3 days. At that point use had been very light. I‚Äôve since removed most of the finish on the outer surface and I‚Äôm ambivalent about its appearance.  The data it collates is fairly useful and moderately accurate. Its greatest utility so far has been identifying anomalous variables and realizing their significance.   The reliability of data collection however is less than perfect. I‚Äôm meticulous about cleaning the ring but it regularly either fails to collect data or fails to report that data to the app. Its ‚Äònear perfect sleep algorithm‚Äô can‚Äôt differentiate napping and reading or watching a movie for me.  The ring is my 5th wearable tracking device and the least disruptive.   I received the ring as a gift and I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôll be buying the subscription for this $90/gram piece of infotainment jewelry.
3,krutsky,"Love the ring and the app, but I am not getting low battery alerts unless I am in the app. Last night my ring was dead, and I didn‚Äôt check my sleep score until later in the day, only to realize it has been dead most of the night and all day. Not being obsessive over my stats, I may go a day or two without looking at the app. I get every other alert from the app, and I have sticky banners on so I have to manually clear it from my screen, so it isn‚Äôt like I missed a notification."
5,KagyThings,"The metrics tracked by this ring are useful in various ways to assist you in not only seeing what your body is doing but Oura gives advice on what to do with the info. On a few occasions where I notice I‚Äôm irritated quickly, I‚Äôve checked the app and noticed my sleep pattern was different than usual. Oura helps me know what‚Äôs going on internally which gives me peace of mind.  The bad: now I know how my sleep is negatively affected by stress, children, puppy, and alcohol. No, it‚Äôs not exactly bad. Knowledge is power."
3,danam1651,"I‚Äôm fairly new to wearing the ring. Love the idea of look and functionality of the ring and not having to wear a big watch to track health. BUT the app needs major updates specifically the ability to track workouts. The limited selection for choosing workouts is so frustrating and then trying to navigate to add a workout based on heart rate read. If this had more features like the Apple Watch, this would be the best tracker on the market. Apple Watch is more advanced all around."
4,NikRain in the game,"I love this app and the ring. The ring is super light but can scratch easily. The app needs new features such as being able to add a workout to the previous day. Sometimes I forget to add a workout as soon as I‚Äôm done. Also, it would be nice to have a notes section for that workout you record. This could help me keep track of what workouts I did or just to record how I was feeling during the workout."
1,johnnyhwin,"I‚Äôve had the ring since last summer and after the latest update the battery dies within 10 hours. Completely unusable. Had to reach out to customer service to see if the warranty window is still open. If it‚Äôs closed, then this thing only lasts a year.   Fwiw when it did work I found the sleep tracking to be useful and better than the Whoop‚Äôs but preferred the Whoop‚Äôs activity tracking since it measures your HR continuously. So don‚Äôt get the Oura for fitness, get it for sleep and recovery and for the form factor (which IMO is superior to the wristband). If only the ring battery wasn‚Äôt such an issue."
3,ollamuz,The app is fine. Has basic features and some helpful reports.  But it‚Äôs not working well with the ring - it takes forever to sync ring data to the app. In the morning when I want to see how was my night it takes me a few attempts to actually sync and see the data. Sometimes it‚Äôs taking that long that I forget and never check it. So the ring becomes king of useless. Please fix your performance. It‚Äôs not helpful and very annoying to wait for 30 min and have a few attempts trying to see my data.
5,Queen_aba,"UPDATE: I contacted Oura, and they determined that my ring was faulty and sent a new one. The communication was good, and I had no trouble getting the replacement.  So far, the new one is working well!  This ring was amazing until a couple of weeks ago.  Now the battery dies and I don‚Äôt get a notification on the app.  I took it off the charger last night at 5:30, and it‚Äôs at 3% today at 3:30.  A charge that lasts under 24 hours is not acceptable.  What on earth happened?!?"
2,01Rose!,"I got the Oura ring in order to sync with natural cycles. I‚Äôve had the ring for three months and it isn‚Äôt registering my exercising, and has twice not registered my sleep data due to ‚Äúunfortunate technical issues‚Äù. With the exercising, when it has registered something it is waaay off. For example, I went hiking for a food four hours once and it registered a 14min walk. I‚Äôm very disappointed with all of this. Not only do you pay for the ring, but a monthly subscription. I understand problems arise but my ring is practically new, I would expect more."
3,mnbrick,"Generally speaking it‚Äôs a great product! But considering the short battery life and therefore product life, steep price tag, and additional monthly cost for the app, I expect more. The fact that it does not connect your movement activity with Apple health is a major flaw!!! And makes my apple data, which I share with my coach lacking. And I believe that I am not alone. Because someone who invests in their wellness with technology like this, should want it to be shared globally throughout one‚Äôs device. Please put this in your shortlist!"
1,oura missed the mark,"The first six months I had this ring I was a huge fan. I could get almost a whole week out of a single charge. About 8 months in, Oura started adding new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and encouraged a firmware update. The O2 sensing function almost bricked the ring. I disabled it but it did nothing to stop the battery degradation. It is now down to less than 48 hours of charge (more like 36 hours) and it is barely 11 months old. For the price they charge along with the membership fee, this is completely unacceptable.   I hear there are new competitors coming out, Oura needs to step up their game if it wants to retain users."
2,Bmore3131,"Generally have been loving it, but the recent changes to the visual presentation of the data are horrible and much harder to quickly review. Why change what was perfect before? Also, lately all of a sudden the prompt for sleep changed to being hours earlier than before and won‚Äôt change back (7pm bedtime from 10:30pm?) and it also suddenly is getting the period tracker estimate off base by over a week‚Ä¶if these types of issues continue I‚Äôll probably discontinue use, which is unfortunate because I initially was a huge fan."
1,mk40*,"I updated to the G3 ring because of many issues I was having with the G2 ring, primarily poor sleep tracking.  The G3 Oura ring is still utter crap at detecting when I‚Äôm actually awake, either in the middle of the night or when first going to bed.  I got this ring to try to quantify my insomnia, but it does such a poor job at determining when I'm asleep that it's not a ton of use for that.  There is an edit function where you can change when you went to bed or got up for the day, but there is no mechanism to modify the Oura's mal-identification of sleep mid cycle.  So my hours supposedly asleep is usually off by several hours.   The Location services work maybe 5% of the time, no matter what settings I tweak, even if I have the app open during a run.  As many others have noted, contacting customer service is useless.    The period tracker doesn‚Äôt work  Customer service is nonexistent   Don‚Äôt buy this ring!"
5,Geometa,"I initially got the Oura ring to help me understand sleep and heart issues, which it has done an amazing job. I now understand how certain habits I have affect both and I been able to really get my sleep higher quality. But the thing I did not anticipate was how the activity monitoring would help with improving my overall energy, exercise, and weight. The interface, software, charging, are all easy and intuitive. Well worth the investment!"
1,Tastytowne978,I‚Äôve had this ring for years and I actually even upgraded to the third generation. Customer service is nonexistent this thing does not update it doesn‚Äôt connect it just spins around and around no matter what I do. I have to use my old iPhone from two  years ago to get it to connect to my ring at all and that‚Äôs very inconsistent. I contact customer service multiple times with no response. I would like to figure out how to get this thing repaired or what‚Äôs the problem but nobody back. Very very expensive product for a very low amount of data that actually transmits to the app.
4,RSWIV,"I use a meditation app that syncs to Apple Health. When I meditate, the Oura app should sync that meditation from Apple Health to the ‚Äútake a moment‚Äù or ‚Äúpresence‚Äù part of the Oura app. Currently, you need to use the meditation app built into Oura for it to automatically sync. Or run an ‚Äúunguided presence‚Äù session in Oura at the same time you‚Äôre using your other meditation app, which is totally convoluted. Meditation apps should sync to Oura via Health just like workout apps, if we don‚Äôt want to use Oura‚Äôs built in meditation tools."
5,lulubumom3,"I have had my Oura ring for about two years and used it nightly, charging it during the day. Up until this point, I was satisfied with the device and app.  I find it interesting that a few weeks after the new ring version is released, that my ring magically stops connecting to my phone and the app‚Ä¶. I have followed all the Troubleshooting instructions - no help."
2,_justbill,"Had the app for a month on the free trial, it just ended and basically all the health insight data is paywalled.  Will probably go back to using my old Apple Watch for tracking fitness and sleep or switch over to the Samsung ring that does not require a subscription.   Really bummed because I liked it up until this point. I could see charging a subscription if the rings were cheaper but at the current price point charging a subscription to use the device what for it‚Äôs designed for seems ridiculous."
3,kricex,"It‚Äôs so obvious that this product is exceptional. However, d you have any issues with your ring, expect to get no response or a extremely cookie cutter, copy and paste the response. Literally don‚Äôt even read the email you. Here just read the link below and it‚Äôll tell you what you need to know. If I wanted to read an article, I would‚Äôve gone to the website. Customer service people won‚Äôt get paid enough bc you can tell they don‚Äôt actually care."
3,imteddyp,"The since 2 updates ago, I‚Äôm seeing very different numbers in terms of sleep quality. I know that many things can inpact that, but it has now been a few times where the gap between time in bed and actual sleep is very big.  Also the UI for the contributors (both Readinesses and Sleep) user to be better - everything - now the list items are larger in height which makes me scroll and not being able to get a glimpse on what went well / can be improved."
5,AvatarAustin,I work nights and this app does a bad job tracking my sleep since I sleep during the day. This app really needs a setting for night shift workers and the sleep graph needs to show more time so we could see our entire sleep session and trim/adjust as necessary. I got the ring mainly for sleep data and am disappointed in this regard but I am hopeful that this review might be read and an update might address these concerns.
5,NYC21272,"The app is amazing, it delivers rest and recovery insights as to how my daily activities impact my body‚Äôs readiness. I truly believe these type of insights are ahead of their time when people are neglecting the keys to true health and opting for fast fixes to optimizing their health, beauty, mind etc. I can directly see how drinking a lot with friends impacts my next days readiness directly, and how it‚Äôs more about quality of sleep rather than quantity."
5,nsnassassin,"As someone who struggles with insomnia as well as other mental health challenges, my Oura ring has helped me hold myself accountable for being in touch with my body and mind and overall health. It makes tracking sleep and activity interesting and engaging. I also find the app to be extremely helpful in explaining what each feature/detail means and why it is important. Not to mention beautiful UX / design."
4,TarekMMD,"I am very pleased with this ring for the sleep tracking and heart rate and variability. The only couple of issues with it are the unexplained occasional gaps during sleep. And, sometimes it just misses the first few hours of sleep completely.   The other issue is it counts fast walking outside as moderate exercise. And slow stepping inside as high activity. Seems backwards to me.   Question: why can‚Äôt it tell me my heart rate and variability when I‚Äôm awake? That is a great help in calming down and getting heart mind coherence."
4,jazzlogic,"I have been enjoying getting a better understanding of my patterns. I‚Äôve only had it for about 3 weeks now and recently it had stopped bringing in my workout activities from my Apple Watch. Also, it would be nice if I could create and save my own activities to be able to flag. Anytime I have added my own activity flag comment, I‚Äôve not been able to see them in any timeline. The preset activity flags are nice, but given the different nuances of individuals, I‚Äôd want to create my own as well."
3,sfmw776,"The Oura ring is a fantastic piece of engineering and the data in the app is awesome. The thing that needs to be improved is the integration with Apple Health. It seems like a big miss and simple enhancement to integrate more data (ie steps) with Apple Health.   The data is already available in the app and it should be straightforward to add it into health so that it can be viewed with other sources.   The ring is the one device that I always wear but if I have to go to multiple places to see different types of activity (I.e. biking, running) then the ring‚Äôs usefulness is diminished."
3,Runiac5,I have exchanged several emails over the past 12 months with tech support regarding the inconsistency of heart rate data when running outdoors. It is NOT user error snd i have addressed all possible failures on my end to fix the problem. Having that data was the main reason I upgraded from my first generation oura. The product is great in many respects but it id hard for me to understand how an entry level fitbit can record exercise data more consistently than this ring
1,AustinNdallas,"If you get up at night to let your dog out, grab a glass of water or use the restroom, OURA WON‚ÄôT WORK FOR YOU. The foundation upon which the Oura concept is built is sleep quantity and quality; the problem is it's very sensitive in the way it records a wake-up. I get up to let my dogs outside a few hours before I wake up each morning and it never fails, Oura records that time as when I wake up. I go back to bed for 3 to 4 hours after I'm up for less than 3 minutes and every day it tells me I'm not getting enough sleep. I have reported this to their technical support months ago and haven't heard a peep. At this point the ring is useless to me. If you're not a stone cold sleeper, beware."
4,Balugawhales,"love this app and ring. but one major frustration is the ‚Äúbody clock‚Äù function not adjusting to my new pattern. when i got my ring i worked nightshift, so obviously the midpoint of my sleep was roughly 8am. now that i am day shift, the ring thinks i am not optimizing based on my body clock. really wish this feature coild be fixed or updated. i know i am not the only one frustrated with this as i have posted on Reddit with similar responses."
5,Echo9821,"I use my Oura to track my biometrics as chronic illness (MS, SLE, Sjogren‚Äôs & Fibro) can often be unpredictable. Oura helps me realize what‚Äôs happening on the inside so I could get a better handle on my health. I use the tags for notes to track symptoms and flares. My son uses an Oura as well to track his sleep as he‚Äôs a full time student, works part time and trains everyday at the gym. Oura keeps gives him  knowledge so he stays in the best shape possible."
4,SwimSwamSwum92,"It‚Äôs so nice to have an option that‚Äôs not a watch/bracelet. I don‚Äôt even have to think about my ring most days until it‚Äôs due for a charge. The one thing I would LOVE to be able to do is add a workout tag whenever I want. Sometimes I forget to add my workout from the day before, wake up the next day and then I can‚Äôt do anything about it. It skews my readiness score and I would love to see a change here. Thanks!"
3,Broken--app.net,It would be nice to see the actual temperature data instead of the body temperature variation.  It would also be nice to collect all data during day or 24hrs even if that mean 2 days battery life vs 7 instead of just during the night.  Like give us a choice if battery life is the hold up.  With this whole covid thing temperature data is critical in determining the onset of a possible sickness.  Otherwise great app and decent product.  The ring feels cheap being made of plastic but other than that it works as advertised.
4,Asatly,"Wish they made an iPad app so you could upload data to your phone and it shows on the iPad app. Like Apple Watch, and Oxa Life breathing trainer  I don‚Äôt like the one device per account limitation that Oura imposes. I have multiple iOS devices and while I don‚Äôt mind having to upload my Oura info to one device , I want to be able to pick up any of my devices and see that info, especially the larger screen devices."
2,somecrazynickname,"Oura has serious difficulty tracking interrupted sleep. Even just getting up to pee will throw it off. The first few hours of sleep will be erased from its memory and Oura will claim you went to sleep at 2:30am. This has happened many times.   The REM and Deep sleep are often way off base. I recently did a sleep study at a hospital and the Oura ring‚Äôs analysis was quite different from the study results.   It shows a sleep graph and claims you can drag the end bars to the correct time of sleep - but you can only shorten the time shown; not drag the bars to an earlier time.   Oura had promised temperature measurement/monitoring   But all it does is give you a number above or below ‚Äúyour baseline‚Äù. It never tells you what that baseline temp is.   I had hoped to be able to see WHEN my lowest temperature is at night, but there is no graph that shows you your temp variation during sleep."
5,Jmer78,"Oura has improved my ability to track and understand my habits (both good and bad), and significantly improve my ability to manage my health. Great product!  The main negative comment is the battery life. It degrades fairly quickly. It‚Äôs supposed to last 7 days, but 5 months in and I‚Äôm now at 5 days. If this downward trend continues I‚Äôm going to need a new ring every year - not good."
5,LVStyles,"The OURA ring has guided me to a better understanding of how to improve my health through a good nights rest. I had tried on my own to restore my quality of sleep, however, OURA collects data to give me advice based on my personal sleep and activity patterns.  The unobtrusive nature and wearability of the device as a ring supports my continued use. I am confident that my renewed attention and memory levels, without medication, can be attributed to the OURA data."
3,!root,"The activity portion of this ring/app is completely unreliable. It will tell me that I have walked 10 miles by noon and I haven‚Äôt even left my house.  I‚Äôm fairly certain that when I wash dishes (which is constant) or scrub the shower, it‚Äôs counting my hand movement as steps...  This has been a trend since day 1.   I feel that this portion of the app needs to be benched until it can be report accurately as the activity data seems to be taken into consideration for ‚Äòreadiness‚Äô and many other sections of the app (which means they are also likely inaccurate)."
2,cfalvey1,"I have had the ring for over a year now and multiple times I know for a fact that I was awake, but when I look at my data in the morning it says I was asleep. Last night I was awake from 1am to almost 4am and a large part of that it counted as REM sleep even though I was awake and using my phone. So not accurate. I also didn‚Äôt like that there were no rings that looked like for women so I got a black one. I also don‚Äôt like that when I work nights it doesn‚Äôt always tell me my sleep if it was during the day."
5,NammaSus,I have had my Oura ring for almost a year. It has improved my life in all the right ways. My sleep improves consistently. I have a grounded sense of health because I can actually track so many aspects of my well-being. I'm connected to all kinds of resources through this company. I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to improve your health.
3,s2570,"My husband and I both do not care for the new interface. And I notice that the daytime stress graph sometimes doesn‚Äôt appear until late in the day and also has many more gaps since the most recent upgrade. This is one of the tools I use the most and it is really disappointing to have it not read my levels for much of the day, despite me checking to see that my ring is positioned correctly and not wet or anything. Please fix thisüôèüèª"
5,Dee Lious,"I got on board couple years or so ago and oh what an amazing journey. Learned so much about my sleep and health. It is accurate beyond belief. I was just on vacation, partying, not sleeping good and my ring was telling me daily that things weren‚Äôt right. One day my temp was up 2.8 degrees. Got home took a Covid test and sure enough I was positive! Ring don‚Äôt lie. Don‚Äôt get me started on the amazing customer service."
1,KevinNV,"I can‚Äôt believe they swindled me into paying monthly for the app, it‚Äôs the only reason I force myself to wear the painful rash-causing oversized ring.   Was super disappointed in the sleep tracking which is why I bought the thing, often inaccurate I can wake up 6 times in a night and it counts 1-2. It has temperature capabilities but it doesn‚Äôt correlate those graphs with my sleep patterns so I can‚Äôt see if that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm waking up‚Ä¶ I really regret buying the oura and the $6/month is just a monthly reminder that it‚Äôs not worth it. Cancelled today, finally can throw the ring away ü•≥"
5,quchie man,"I‚Äôve been wearing the ring almost 3 years now. It‚Äôs unobtrusive and gives you good feedback. The company is great and easy to deal with if you have questions or issues. The ring doesn‚Äôt do everything but what it does, it gets right. I really don‚Äôt want my sleep and fitness tracker to be able to send emails and play music. Would highly recommend this ring!!!"
4,musicianeer,"Oura has the most beautiful app of any fitness hardware. It also has the most unique hardware.   The apple health integration is very good. I wish the activities and sleep stages synced out. Similarly, I wish external heart rate information synced in. It‚Äôs a little silly that it doesn‚Äôt to that. If Oura thinks this is going to keep me locked in that‚Äôs silly. The differentiated hardware is what keeps me using Oura, not whether it syncs my activities out.   I wish the Oura app could do more related to fitness. For example, I wish I could record more activities, like hiking or tennis. And that I could record nutrition. Or that it connected directly to workout devices at home, like Peloton and Tonal, or at the gym, like Stairmaster.   Overall it‚Äôs a good app and I hope it continues to improve."
2,Gkgro,"Not sure the technology is there yet. Didn‚Äôt find the information actionable, more of a novelty (cool info). Went Jeeping with my ring on and it said I got 23 miles of steps!  Crazy. Apparently you shouldn‚Äôt wear it on road trips. Got an awesome night of sleep after being sick, sleep machine gave me 100 pts, Oura Ring gave me one of my worst sleep scores!  Tech support said ring was ‚Äòoperating as designed‚Äô‚Ä¶?  Get up at night sometimes as a volunteer firefighter, ring counts sleep before I leave or after I get back. Doesn‚Äôt add them together. Very expensive wearable given its shortfalls."
5,Applepearduck,App keeps improving much much better than when i started using it. Never thought i needed some of the features till i got them. My sleep has improved too after knowing the causes. And Ring after 3 years of constant abuse started having issues. Oura took care of it no fuss. Thanks great worküëç worth the subscription.
3,CurryMe,"I really like my ring and wear it constantly (3 stats). But the app is not capable of making any sense of my sleep cycle which is non-24. It can't add any exercise you might do after midnight. It doesn't use data from step counter to track activity. It does pretty good with sleep IF you only sleep at night. Also, I think there is so much more that they could do with the data to give a unique user experience. I look forward to future updates."
5,jeevanmd2,"The Oura ring is independently assessed as the best personal sleep tracker available.   My personal experience echoes that assessment.  Furthermore, their customer services is consistently reliable.   And lastly, I have to mention that the charging cords for the Oura ring which are USB A-C are the most versatile, most reliable, most robust, and most resilient cords I have ever encountered.  If everybody made cords like they did, it would be amazing."
5,AZtinaMarie,"I have worn my ≈åura ring daily for several years now. I have come to rely on it to help me manage chronic disease. Prior to using the ring, I used 2 different fitness trackers. Neither one came close to providing the data and information the ≈åura app provides. In addition, the few times I have had an issue or question, support has been quick and helpful. Highly recommended!"
1,1989MJCPMN,"The most frustrating part of this purchase is that the company tagged on a monthly fee they want you to pay for life. Nothing in the activity tracker works at all and the sleep tracker isn‚Äôt entirely accurate either. You pay a premium for the hardware and then unless you pay a monthly fee on top of that forever, that hardware will be rendered completely useless. It will just sit in your junk drawer. A total scam from a company that doesn‚Äôt care about its users at all. It‚Äôs a shame, because they had a real opportunity to make something great here. Spare yourself."
2,gdggfhhhbb,"I was tricked into buying the new ring last year in the hopes that it would replace my chest strap HR monitor for real-time HR monitoring during workouts. I tried in vain to ask Oura if the new ring was capable of this function. I was never contacted by a human. I bought it anyway, enticed by the $100 discount. When  the real-time HR function finally went live in June, I was disappointed. The new ring reports HR data only after your workout, and it was about 20 beats off from my chest strap data. I am now questioning whether it‚Äôs accurately measuring my HR  during sleep."
1,TriAtl,"Edit: Still garbage, even after support reached out and said they fixed the issue.  If you‚Äôre trying to get accurate metrics from the Oura Ring (which is the assumption if you are buying the ring), think again. Currently the app does not pull workout data from Apple Health. This skews all other Readiness and Recovery metrics. Essentially, this renders the app useless, which also renders the device useless. Oddly, the company admits this problem and has done nothing about in for at least a month. Be careful, customers are effectively part of a public beta testing program."
3,CwwC,"I‚Äôve been loving Oura for a few years now! But in a recent update, manually added workouts get ‚Äúdropped‚Äù from the active burn. The manually added item will show up on the Activity screen, but the bars in the histogram will disappear, as do the calories burned - which leads to missing your goal on some days, even though you actually achieved the goal! I‚Äôll update my review when this gets fixed. Thanks for listening!"
5,Nech18,I got tired of starring at my screen every morning hoping the ring updates. Last night I had amazing sleep over 8 hours and today the ring is still trying to connect I charged it 2  days ago and the same thing happened. It‚Äôs just too annoying to upkeep so I‚Äôm ditching it today exactly one year later today
5,Paul Paul 24,"I love my Gen 3, the app- all of It. I will caution that if you do a lot of weight lifting the bottom of the ring will wear aesthetically but it has no functionality issues so far!  My only suggestion would be developing a Home Screen widget. I know they aren‚Äôt the most popular but I find them so useful and I feel it could make the Oura data a little more accessible throughout the day!"
3,Paolla D,"I‚Äôve been using Oura for over a year now. I really like the battery and the insights it provides me, but in the morning when I want to check my sleep report it takes soooo long to load in the app, not to mention when it won‚Äôt connect and shows ‚Äútrouble connecting?‚Äù Message, even tho my ring is literally touching the phone.  The app needs improvement and should allow customization on the screens and data we want to see."
4,ashdub2,"I absolutely LOVE my Oura ring and have been using for over a year. I love that I can track my sleep, activity, movement but also connect with the Natural Cycles app and track my flows. However, recently I‚Äôve become pregnant and my Oura scores are low in comparison to before. I wish there was a way to notify the Oura app that you‚Äôre pregnant and start getting proper insights for pregnancy. Otherwise, I 10/10 recommend the Oura ring!"
3,Dommy1212121,"Great app for tracking sleep. I do notice however sometimes my naps never get tracked at all. Yes, I make sure my ring is in the proper position before and after me nap. Sometimes oura ring will notify me hours later that I had a nap. If you‚Äôve also had more than one nap it doesn‚Äôt track it either. Would love to see the nap detection fixed and maybe the ability to track multiple naps if you were only able to get multiple smaller naps in. Thanks!"
3,Rob.Viater,"Everything is great with the product and customer service. But over the last 6-8 months (over 2 different phones-iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max & iOS 15 and iOS 16), the app will randomly not launch. Just auto closes. So, I have to delete the app, and reinstall it and go through the setup process again‚Ä¶ it can happen between 3-5 times per week. Not sure if it‚Äôs me or the app. Please fix this guys!"
1,Terkkila,For the second time this year the app refuses to open after an update. It just crashes on startup. The only way I‚Äôve found - no thanks to your support documents - is to uninstall the app and then go through the whole process of setting up the ring again. Last time this was at least tolerable but this time I LOST DATA.   The Oura ring and the app design are both excellent - but both are useless if the app will not open and loses data unexpectedly. This should be your developers highest priority- even above the already very late new features.
3,Mickeychcg,"It‚Äôs not buggy. It works well. My displeasure is with the non-stop patronizing messaging it sends me every morning. Look I sleep about as well as I ever have and I really don‚Äôt need to read that ‚Äúpoor me, you really should take it easy today, you‚Äôre obviously exhausted and maybe tomorrow‚Äôll be better.‚Äù I don‚Äôt need a hunk of titanium and some encoded opinions of ‚Äúhealth experts‚Äù telling me if they think I‚Äôm rested and ready enough for my day. Give me the data, I‚Äôll do my own interpretation, thank you very much."
2,Cali_X,"It used to be a 5 star app. I love this ring. It used to count workouts after midnight, before you go to sleep for the day before. I loved that, as that is still part of the day to me. One of the updates took away that calculation. Now any activity logged between 12am-4am don‚Äôt count on your activity tracker. BOOO!!!! Bring back that activity tracking, and I‚Äôd be happy to return your 5 star review. I love the sleep tracking and the smart activity tracking. This small thing ruins it for me. I don‚Äôt get to account for all my activity anymore!"
5,Tombomojo,This ring is amazing!  It tracks all my activity and is great for monitoring my sleep.  It was Dr recommended and a great investment.  The battery life is several days long.  I lost my Oura then found it by using a Bluetooth tracker app and located it in the garbage can.  It would have been lost forever had Oura customer service not suggested using a Bluetooth tracker to help me.  I‚Äôm a huge fan for life now!
4,rsmets,"The home screen of this new ux feels like I am opening my son‚Äôs learn to read game or an elderly‚Äôs TV guide. Tiles are way too big and make the whole experience clunky. Whatever PM thought this was a good idea should probably excuse themselves from their role.  May I request a setting to remove the huge tiles in favor of a more compact home screen ux?   However, this product does certainly enrich my overall health observability. In that regard I can‚Äôt recommend it enough."
1,Vinbar77,"Purchased a 2nd gen Oura Ring 2 years ago and enjoyed the sleep tracking features. However, I am rating 1 star for two reasons. First, the ring died (battery according to support) after two years and 90 days, so it was out of Warranty by a few days and they offered me nothing but apologies. Next, the 3rd generation ring requires a monthly subscription to access YOUR data. This is reprehensible and lack of API access to the Oura data means they are blocking third party apps that could enhance the user experience. Oura does not care for its customers and is just doing a quick money grab."
1,GC1167,"I‚Äôve been using the Oura Ring for a while, but lately, it‚Äôs been a frustrating experience. My ring struggles to hold a charge, lasting only 1‚Äì2 days (sometimes just one), and frequently disconnects from my device. This makes it unreliable for tracking my data.  When I tried to reach out to Oura‚Äôs support, I hit a dead end. Their email support is no longer monitored, and their in-app AI assistant, ‚ÄúFinn,‚Äù is completely useless‚Äîit has never worked for me. The email response I received was also generated by Finn, which makes the whole situation even more impersonal and unhelpful.  Oura advertises a ‚Äúpersonalized support experience,‚Äù but this couldn‚Äôt feel farther from the truth. For the cost of the ring and subscription, I expect much better customer service and reliable hardware.  I hope the company addresses these issues soon because right now, it‚Äôs hard to recommend the product to others."
4,Szabolcs Pasztor,I‚Äôm overall highly satisfied with the app and it works reliably. The new design update on sleep score/readiness though feels uncalled for. The new look is so spacious there‚Äôs no way to overview the metrics on one screen anymore as they overflow vertically. You took a great screen and made it what in my perspective is mediocre. Is there a way to get the old one back? Could at least be a feature flag.
2,RGllc,"Loved the product, but I am having an awful time having my IPhone 13 recognize the device.  The Oura app is also not prompting for setting up an existing ring‚Ä¶only a new ring or click here if you don‚Äôt have one.  When signing into the app it also prompts me to get install updates but the app stays perpetually on this screen.  I‚Äôve tried numerous times up to 30 minutes.  In Oura limbo on a product that I‚Äôve vouched for with friends and family.  5 star product with a 2 star service fix."
3,HealthyMatters,While the app itself is great in terms features the ring connectivity is very slow and often takes minutes for the app to connect to the ring and download the data. The app continuously connects and disconnects from the ring. This bug was fixed with an earlier version of ring firmware but the most recent ring firmware upgrade broke it. As a result of the connectivity issue the ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù feature of the app does not work.
1,"Paul, Cambridge MA","I was really looking forward to having the ring, which I finally got after Thanksgiving. It was however really disappointing to learn that only the pre-Gen3 users get to just pay for the ring and then use it stress-free. Everyone else is coerced into a monthly payment plan, akin to signing up for a new phone plan, that will never end for as long as you want to use the regular functionalities of the ring. It makes for a really unpleasant experience. I already dissuaded two friends from buying the ring because of that‚Ä¶"
3,Tom night,Great app however the meditation feature no longer works and just errors.  They‚Äôve been telling me for 6 weeks they‚Äôre working hard to fix it however it never gets fixed. Obviously they aren‚Äôt.  If you don‚Äôt care about that it great buts it‚Äôs pretty frustrating for someone who uses the feature daily.    I guess since there no other option I‚Äôll just have to deal with it until another company comes out with something better
5,thatvietartist,I absolutely love the app and the information it provides me to guide me on my journey of caring cor my body. I just wish I could share this structure with others even if they don‚Äôt like the style/look of the ring itself!  Just a few of my friends and coworkers already love their current devices and how the look on them.
5,Ryerye400,"I have had the ring for 9 months now. It has been very helpful in understanding my sleep patterns and how to improve it.  One thing I will hope they improve is compatibility with more apps. The 2 other apps I used to monitor strength training and cardio are ‚ÄòSTRONG‚Äô and ‚ÄòMapmyrun‚Äô. These 2 do not connect directly, but STRONG data gets to Apple health, then to the app."
2,PhitPhanie,"I love the concept and the platform for O≈´ra. I have been enjoying monitoring sleep, stress, activity, etc. But I‚Äôm so, so fed up with the constantly freezing app. I just opened the app to log a workout, and it took me close to 30 minutes. I have checked phone and app updates, and they are all up to date. I restarted my phone‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt matter. Still freezing all the time. I don‚Äôt have 30 minutes to log a 30 minute workout. I cannot waste this time. Very bummed by these glitches."
2,Jimmy9919192929,If you‚Äôre not going to pay for the subscription this thing is absolutely useless. All you get to see is your 3 scores for the day. Those scores are sort of meaningless without the context the data provides. I think at this point I‚Äôll just pitch this thing in the trash.  Figure it out Oura. Why can‚Äôt we just store the data locally and view that? It would cost you nothing!!!!  I refuse to pay for this subscription indefinitely. I think I‚Äôll just pitch it in the trash. Corporate greed at its finest.
3,f8cr,"Worked fine first 7 days then sleep tracking + the new ~nap & workout detection~ stopped working reliably. It‚Äôs unfortunate bc I really appreciate good UX w wearables & I was looking for something great to supplement my Apple Watch specifically for sleep‚Ä¶  But $450 after tax is too expensive for a hit or miss on results first thing in the morning. Lol can‚Äôt start my day w this kinda buyers remorse!  Again, beautiful presentation but day-to-day experience is not there & not worth price point."
1,G-Brew,"I purchased an Oura ring approximately 2 months ago. I had an Apple Watch, but wanted to give Oura a try based on the reviews and not wanting to wear a watch all the time.  For the first few months, everything worked well. Then, approximately 2 weeks ago it started having problems synching and tracking both my sleep and activity (not tracking at all). To make matters worse, I sent a ‚ÄúHelp Request‚Äù on the 26th, but was told the response time is 6-7 days.  For $300, my expectations of Oura‚Äôs product and customer service were higher. As of now, still have not received a response from them."
5,Plant lady 3,"I don‚Äôt know what I would do with out my Oura ring. I never take it off and look forward to reviewing my sleep score every morning and when I retire I chaeck my steps. It‚Äôs the best purchase I‚Äôve made in a couple years!! I would purchase it a 100‚Äùs over. I love the app, tells me everything I need to know. Very thankful I‚Äôm part of the Oura family."
5,Jinfaa,"Hello, can you add feature to track meditation? I'd like to see how long my streak is at least. Like InsightTimer. I use meditation every days, but I don‚Äôt know how to see how many hours total I spend in meditation. And second feature I want to see how does it affect my stress level day by day?  Ps: and my session after meditation almost of time never synced. Fix please!!!"
5,SDL4Real,"I don‚Äôt write reviews usually in fact, I do not remember if I‚Äôve ever written one. But without a doubt, this is one of the best gadgets that I‚Äôve bought years and certainly the best one that has contributed to my health and well-being.   I‚Äôll be surprised if Apple doesn‚Äôt buy this company in a few years time."
5,soulcial media,"My favorite tool in my arsenal by FAR. It is something I wouldn‚Äôt want to be without. Working night shifts, it‚Äôs super important and valuable to me to track my sleep. My ring had an issue with the battery and they stepped right up to the plate and replaced it FOR FREE. This is an expensive tool, so for them to stand behind their customers means so much to me. I‚Äôll for sure buy any and all next generations. Thank you Oura!"
3,RBRaven,"I love what the ring has to offer in terms of sleep and wellness monitoring. I love the readiness score. I love the new sleep data it generates- All from a ring. Pretty cool technology. Unfortunately, I am unable to connect with my ring, at least twice a month. Sometimes it connects after several attempts, sometimes I have to stand on one leg, pat my belly, and rub my head. Or is that the other way around? Anyway, I do not like technology that is unstable. Hopefully they will figure it out."
5,autobahns,Lovely app and extremely useful for all the information the ring provides and showing it in meaningful ways.   Note: Latest update broke dark mode / dark icon and now the icon looks misplaced next to other big brand apps that have adopted the dark mode icons regardless of it not being explicitly their brand colors.
2,KpTry'n,"I‚Äôve loved my ring and the app since receiving it as a gift in 2022. Every year after updates are made, the battery life for my ring degrades drastically. Customer service sent me a replacement last year and now, after the newest rounds of upgrades, which I enjoy, the ring won‚Äôt hold a charge for 24hrs. I was offered another refurbished ring or $50 off a new one. I love the app but can‚Äôt afford a new ring and I‚Äôm concerned this has become a trend. I hate to have to cut my losses but‚Ä¶"
2,Yoyomama99,I‚Äôve had the ring for over two years (v3). Paid the subscription for two years. Stopped in January 2024 because it just didn‚Äôt seem to be accurate. I went without the subscription 9 months. Horrible. They only give you couple numbers which is a joke. When I received and Optimal rating one night after it was a so so sleep night I was done. I think they purposely mess with your scores to get you back to paying. Yes I followed all the best practices for wearing it. I‚Äôm going back to my iWatch.
2,Ndmnd,"I used to have a Whoop and switched to the Oura ring for about three years. I liked the Ouraring a lot better, as the interface WAS more user-friendly. However, this new update is making me think about switching back to Whoop. The new app is really bad. While I assume the goals were trying to make it easier to see your stats, the new vitals section is very crowded, making it harder to find the vitals you‚Äôre looking for. The old app was MUCH better."
5,Nikkima02,"I used to have a fit watch and after 5 years it died. I got my Oura ring about 2 years ago and I love it. Definitely won‚Äôt be going back. However, since the update about 2 weeks ago it appears my sleep data is not being recorded accurately, especially my deep sleep. Any other reports of this?"
1,Faithbomb,"Rating the app on the recent update, and sharing here for developers. Multiple people that I know have agreed, and there‚Äôs nowhere else to share feedback except with a chat bot.   A timeline? We have enough timelines on other apps that are unnecessary, and now it‚Äôs on the main page of this app?  We like it better the other way. Now we have a timeline we don‚Äôt need, and the app compresses the information that was so easily visible with less clicking. If people don‚Äôt like the app, they use it less, that‚Äôs disappointing, and that is just my two cents"
2,LMTamy,"When I first got my Oura Ring 3 months ago I would have rated it 5 stars and even recommended the ring/app to people around me. Now I regret that. The daytime stress metric is an atrocity. Not only is it unuseful, it adds unnecessary stress and confusion. I was laying in bed with a heart rate of 55-60 feeling relaxed when the new daytime stress function was flaming red and telling me I was stressed. What should have been classified as restorative was classified as stressful.   It would be one thing if it was actually accurate  and was an optional metric to display but it is neither of those."
4,PaleoGirl413,"I love my ring but please stop telling me I‚Äôm sick because my heart rate and temperature is slightly elevated in the two weeks after ovulation. I know you know that‚Äôs what it is because occasionally you mention it right on the app, but it continues to affect my readiness score and I‚Äôm told to take it easy for half the month just because my body is having a normal menstrual cycle."
5,jjn513,"The Oura ring makes it super easy to learn more about my sleep habits and daily activity levels. It provides detailed information, is comfortable to wear, & looks great. The app lays everything out so I can see my results at a glance & it also allows me to dig deeper should I want to make notes or compare days. After a few months of seeing how much I love it & learn from it, my husband got one too!"
2,Ariel L D,"The functionality of this app is just sad. No ability to add a workout for another day, no ability to adjust sleep other than on one end or the other of your sleep, and the ring is terrible at picking up workouts (and sometimes misses when you are awake during the night). These would not be hard things to add to the app, and they make a big difference - the assumptions are essentially useless if you forget to put all of the information in every day."
5,EMFlessJeff,The Oura ring is allowing me to get feedback on myBehavior and I‚Äôve been improving my sleep and general well-being by paying attention to the data it is providing. I love the fact that you can put it into airplane mode during the day and night yet it will still collect data
2,WesSouza_,"Before you can use your device, even if you prepaid for the service, you are required to register your personal details including address.  The address validation has several issues, initially preventing me from continuing because it couldn‚Äôt recognize ‚ÄúBrooklyn‚Äù nor ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù as a municipality when I tried signing up on iPhone.  Thankfully it worked when I tried on my Mac, albeit in a very confusing process that suggested edits but didn‚Äôt allow me to proceed if I didn‚Äôt accept those ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù."
4,Kbuchignani,"I love my Oura ring but I woke up this morning and when I went to check on my sleep and sync my natural cycles app, there was this obnoxious tacky little Oura ring character in the lower right corner of the ring app. It reminds me of the paper clip from the old word programs. It‚Äôs annoying and I want it gone I seriously hate it. It makes the whole experience seem silly now please get rid of it!"
3,Lancaster850,"I have had this ring for over six months now and I would not recommend anyone buy it. After a few months, the ring quit connecting to the app on a daily basis. It doesn‚Äôt record sleep data several nights a week. I literally have to download the app every day to get the ring to operate the way it was advertised to. My first non-favorable review didn‚Äôt get posted, maybe this one will!"
1,Chanman81897,"First of all, I really do love my oura ring, however one glaring issue that is ruining the app and overall experience is that you cannot add a workout unless you are adding it before the end of the day. In other words, if you work out but forget to enter it in, the app is going to interpret your raise in heart-rate as stress, which will bring down many of your scores and there isn‚Äôt anything you can do to change it. This makes your results inaccurate, especially if this happens multiple instances over time."
5,MarlenySM,I love my oura ring! My daughter gave me the ring for 2021 Christmas.  I love so much that I purchase one for my husband for Christmas 2022.   It keep me informed of the changes I need to do to improve my overall health.  It is great seeing my sleep patterns and the improvements with just little changes following the digestions.   I really recommended to all my friends to get one.
2,Korb23,"For at least my first year with the ring it was really bad at tracking naps. Over the past six months it was starting to really get them, even tracking 20 minute naps accurately. Now over the past few weeks it again never get naps. One day I napped for like 2 hours and nothing. It just doesn‚Äôt seem like me being completely still with a significantly reduced heart rate and respiratory rate should be that difficult to identify. At least ask if maybe I was napping."
5,agirlnamed_mo,"I‚Äôve been wearing my Oura ring since early February, and I am impressed daily by the information it provides. As a full time med student and CrossFit athlete, it can be difficult to keep well balanced - but this ring has been a major game changer in the way I plan my days, the way I train, and the way I study. I feel amazing! A ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è products for sure!"
4,Chrysbeats,The Oura Ring and all are excellent! I love the rich insights and the detailed data. Sometimes the sleep data seems off‚Äîtoo much awake time‚Äîbut no app or device is perfect.   Feature request: allow user to expand/edit sleep times like the Whoop and other sleep apps do. Some nights the Oura Ring doesn‚Äôt accurate capture my sleep and wake times. This causes major discrepancies in the data.
4,Charityjoysamms,"I loooove, love, love my Oura ring and the app as a whole. Only thing I would recommend is: better Home Screen widgets! For the life of me, I do not understand why you have all the options for widgets on the Lock Screen, but on our home screens we can only see a sleep graph??? Give us more Home Screen widgets!!! Even just the same ones as the Lock Screen! Thank youuuuu."
5,L H A,"What can I say? The Oura Ring is the best overall tracker I‚Äôve ever owned, perhaps including my Apple Watch (although I use them differently). And the Oura app is one of the best designed health apps I‚Äôve ever used; it's probably the only health app that provides an experience that's not only singularly useful but also delightful. If you have one tracker+app, it should be Oura."
4,LOOPGOAT,I like the new update. I feel like the big blocks are a little much - wish you could close them.   I also would love to see better more functional Widgets for the app. The current sleep graph is basically pointless lol   I would love to see one with activity data/ stress / heart rate any of the info that is more Beneficial for looking at with a quick glance or throughout the day.
2,Bebefreckles,"I work a rotating shift (days and nights all in the same week). When I sleep during the day and wake up same day, later in the evening, my readiness and sleep doesn‚Äôt show up until the following day. I have my settings on night shift, but I‚Äôm always penalized for time efficiency. It‚Äôs great on recording exercises, but not so good on stress. Starting wearing my ring December 2023. I‚Äôll keep wearing it and see what happens. I still would recommend, but not to people that has a rotating shift."
2,Scott in SF,I‚Äôm not sure how Amy times now I‚Äôve had to uninstalled and reinstall this app to keep it running. When I click the app from the Home Screen it shows the splash screen then immediately shuts down. I‚Äôve tried working on it with their customer success team but their answer is to just uninstall and reinstall and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working on it‚Äù. Been going on for as long as I‚Äôve been a customer. Even upgraded my ring to see if it would continue. It has.
1,-am tn,"Sleep data is what this adds and sleep data is what it does worst. It is wildly inaccurate.  The most obvious mistakes are knowing when I‚Äôm in bed and knowing when I‚Äôm asleep and awake. That is pretty basic, and the ring simply can‚Äôt tell. It regularly reports I go to bed an hour or more off from when I actually do, and it‚Äôs off even more than that in reporting when I‚Äôm awake or asleep. It will report I‚Äôm awake for hours on nights when I was barely awake at all. The sleep pattern data is garbage and should be dropped. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this app."
3,CabinDweller,"For the most part the app works well. However, when importing workouts from Apple health, if you fail to open the Oura app at the end of the day, the app will not pull the workouts from the previous days. It may auto detect the workout but the auto-detection will often be wrong. There is no way to modify previously saved auto-detected work outs. If you make a mistake when saving the workout, you are stuck with the mistake."
5,Tabbser,I‚Äôve really wanted to like this product. I dropped 400 bucks for a ring that is never connected when I check it.   It‚Äôs literally useless if you have to disable Bluetooth and force reconnect the ring every single time you want to use it.  This is just not ready for prime time.
5,Aestelle,"I found Oura a while ago (active lifetime member) and I can honestly say it has changed my life for the better. By focusing on my sleep data, I have found consistently in my life and more balance. I prioritize sleep above all else and for that I have been able to lose 25 pounds in conjunction with calorie counting and my activities."
1,#notyourmamascoach,"Never did it say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to pay $5.99 each month to use this ring‚Äù when I was going through the purchase process. I feel scammed. For $500 that spent I should not have to pay additional to get the rings analytics. Also, it doesn‚Äôt even zoom in on heart rate. It‚Äôs vague- showing the whole day in one chart, can‚Äôt see specifics of how long you were in aerobic bpm- the reason I got ring.  Oh, and the gold isn‚Äôt- it‚Äôs brass. Very yellow with black undertones. Don‚Äôt expect it to match your gold jewelry."
3,Sieniad,"If you‚Äôre a constant traveler and try to keep your circadian rhythm on your home time zone, Oura‚Äôs tracking has a minor glitch. It always adjusts to the local time zone by way of your phone. This may reflect poorly in your sleep score even though your sleep timing is consistent. There is no way to lock Oura to a time zone. The only work-around is to not sync your ring when traveling, but that means you can‚Äôt use it‚Ä¶"
3,Video Boi,"A few app requests: 1. Make the daily reset time user choice, reseting at midnight is very inconvenient for some of us. 2. Have a distinction between sitting and standing, my legs definitely feel more exhausted doing one over the other and the ring can‚Äôt tell. 3. Have the option for the notifications to be louder. I regularly miss them. Might be an Apple related issue but my Postmates notifications are loud so possibly an app issue."
1,OhWellThenWhatToDO,"The reports are very basic. I have idiopathic hypersomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome and am reduced to taking daily screen shots, which are not printer maximized being mostly black ink, to show by sleep and time in bed times next to each other. Also I can only run an HRV report and then a resting heart rate report separately and then put them together. Ideally I would have all this information along with steps and journal entries available to share with my doctor in daily weekly monthly quarterly and annual reports. It would truly be a life changer."
1,TLCREWE,"Since the update on 11/15 the app is not syncing with my Apple Watch despite the appropriate settings/settings/etc‚Ä¶ The app became uninstalled from my Apple Watch Series 8 (that is up to date with system updates) after this app update, I‚Äôve tried re-installing it on my watch, and it tries to load and then it will stop and just say ‚Äúinstall.‚Äù My phone and Apple Watch have not become un synced during this time, and all other previously installed apps on my watch are working as they always have."
1,Irishpan,"Loved our Gen 2 rings with their week long battery and reporting. The app worked great.  My wife quit using her Gen 3 ring due to it not holding a charge for even 2 hours within weeks of purchase.  Mine will make it through 48 hours most of the time.  It seems that each time they update the app, there goes more battery life‚Ä¶ features are good but plan on charging the ring daily within a couple of months, because there‚Äôs no toggle for most options‚Ä¶ and each one consumes more battery."
5,SWFLgal,"I never realized the important of sleep and recovery time. Consistently, I worked out too hard, slept too little, and put in way too many hours at the office. Now I listen to what my ring tells me to do and live my life accordingly. My health and fitness level have never been better!"
1,beelineBlows,"Like others that have recently posted here, and on Instagram, the data sync stopped working after the recent firmware and app Get down updates released by Oura. Tech support did some troubleshooting and, after not being able to fix it, told me I‚Äôd need to buy a new ring. Why am I responsible for the replacement after the Oura update broke it?? Any respectable company would take responsibility for the issues that they created and either correct the update or replace the product."
1,Charlie0357,"Had two Gen 2 rings and then bought a Gen 3 since things seemed to be working.  Gen 3 has been a nightmare, along with the new sleep program.  Won‚Äôt go into detail but customer service was not helpful when I had data drop outs on heart rate and I have since moved on to another device, my Gen 3 ring has been in a bag for months and it will be there until someone wants to try it an and wants the same size.  Not sure if its true but I did hear that the CEO left a while ago, maybe he saw what was coming."
1,HCIV444,"The ring will sometimes pick up a nap and add to your sleep score.  But if you wake up from your nap to go to the restroom, it won‚Äôt register the 2nd half of the nap.  Not good at detecting workouts.  Recently went to grocery store on same day that I did a heavy lifting workout.  It tagged pushing my cart around for 20 minutes as a workout but not the workout that had me drenched in sweat.  Save your money and get another product if good data is what you want.  Although the ring does look really cool before it inevitably scratches.  Feel ripped of."
4,izzy27229,An option to have the old version back would be great. It felt more straightforward and now I feel like I have to fish through the app for all my information. I love the app and what it does for me and I use it every day. Hoping to see a version like the one from just a couple months ago though..
3,Cara RN,I had a gen 2 ring that just quit working.  Ive had it for 2 years and really liked it.  I was getting excited about upgrading to the gen 3 and then then I started considering the cost of the monthly membership.   The cost of the monthly membership in addition to the cost of the ring is not worth it to me.  And the ring without the membership will be a waste.   Oura‚Äî.  If you get rid of the monthly membership let me know.  I‚Äôll invest again.
5,Zen 222,"Love this app and machine. Deep sleep for me seems overestimated compared to other fitness trackers but the HRV and temp measurement put this in a class of one and well worth the money.  One request; Please please add ability to create custom tags - or at least add 2 tags for Dream and Nightmare. These significantly impact HR, HRV and sleep quality and there‚Äôs no way to tag them. Thanks!"
2,HLA1000,I have utilized the ring for almost 4 years now. Have had 2 different versions. Used to only have to charge it once a week or longer. Now it can‚Äôt even go 3 days without being charged and if you go to bed when it‚Äôs at 50% you‚Äôll wake up and it won‚Äôt give you any sleep data saying it didn‚Äôt have enough power. And battery notifications come when you are sleeping or when you wake up. Not helpful.
1,JYashari,"I‚Äôve been an oura user for over 2 years. I genuinely love their ring and the app. It‚Äôs one of the most seamless products out in the wellness space. That being said, their product quality has been compromised over years and their customer service has gone down the drain. I have the newest ring and it won‚Äôt even last over 2 days in battery life and they offer no solutions to fix the issue. I have to say I love what oura is doing, but unless they fix their customer support, they‚Äôve lost a loyal customer."
1,Gloaming1974,"I‚Äôve had my ring for two days. I‚Äôm very sick and have been in bed constantly for the past two days, but the ring shows I‚Äôm doing all sorts of activity‚Äîapparently yesterday while flat on my back sleeping all day, I managed to walk 3700 steps. My Apple Watch, worn at the same time, shows 351. Support is nonexistent, and according to a significant number of people, even if you mail the ring back, it‚Äôs impossible to get a refund. There‚Äôs no phone number. All you get is an email, and they don‚Äôt respond. Im going to talk to my bank and see how to get my money back."
2,TheOtherBrit,"I think my critique of this would be the same as most who have posted previously but the biggest issue is the battery life.  I‚Äôve had the ring a year now and it will stay charged for maybe three days and pretty much never alerts me that the battery is low. I realize it when I‚Äôm like, man, let‚Äôs see how horrible last night‚Äôs sleep was. Nothing.   If the battery life drops any lower than it is now this is going to end up on the back of the closet as it hasn‚Äôt miraculously improved my sleep habits."
3,samlabelle,"This app offers some decent insights from the Oura ring. I think it could improve a lot by actually notifying you each day with your scores. Other wearable tech does this and it‚Äôs really improve the value of this product. Because it doesn‚Äôt, the user has to remember to check it and then wait for the ring to sync. If it was more informative I‚Äôd give it 5 stars"
1,Bong4,I have my ring for almost a year now. I work nights and usually sleeps like 10am. Or 11am then wakes up around 2 or 3pm to eat something. I noticed that my 2 or 3 hours of sleep is considered as a nap...and the previous day's recording is being added and I do get like 10 hours in bed and 5 or 6 hours of sleep time. My only purpose of having this ring is to monitor how much I sleep. It costs $300 plus the monthly subscription. I am not so happy with this anymore. If you can help me fix this I'll stay if nothing I'll just have to cut my subscription.
4,Momsakunt,"Functions exactly as advertised. My one request is for the app to have a function where you can have the ring continuously monitor bpm and oxygen level, so you can see it live. I know it may drain battery life but I like to do yoga and track my oxygen levels and currently there doesn't seem to be a setting to actually measure it live. It does so at 'sleep' only."
2,PiNk Tc,"For the first 2 weeks all was good.  Now for the last few days, my ring has listed Al like it‚Äôs supposed to EXCEPT my breathing regularity and oxygen saturation.  My ring sits as it is supposed to and now that info can‚Äôt be received.  It‚Äôs frustrating that I paid $645 and can‚Äôt get all the data I‚Äôm supposed to get.  It‚Äôs looking like maybe this was an impulsive purchase on my part and I should have looked into the other product options on the market."
1,bluegrassguy,I cannot pay for my membership on the app or the website and therefore my access was cancelled. I continued to receive the same error message. I emailed back and forth for over two weeks with customer service at least 12 times. I like what Oura provides as a health monitoring device. They are clearly struggling with customer service and now I have a $300 plus ring that serves me very little purpose. I even offered to provide my credit card info over the phone or payment by another means.
2,2inschool,"Have had the ring less than a year and find the daily updates helpful to examine my habits and how I can improve my health.  Very disappointed that the recent app updates have defeatured the Gen 2 ring, removing guided moment sessions.   The reason provided on the FAQ was that it was a support issue, but the Gen 2 ring has had guided sessions in the app, so that reason appears not to be true.  Makes me worried that over time that the developers will continue to diminish the app."
5,LucyVH,"So valuable to me.  I have a depression.  It is important to keep track of my health to manage it and monitor progress.  This tool tracks trends for historical data when working with my doc, but it also gives me so much more info when changing or modifying meds.  The ability to make notes is priceless.  It help me monitor how any changes in meds, food, alcohol, and daily activity affect my sleep which plays a major role in wellness.  It allows you identify a trend to make a change before it is too late.    Simply put, it is a versatile tool that provides metrics and information to allow you to maximize your sleep, activity and choices to be your best!"
5,Tallon Cote,"Data is great! Physical product is great! But the app is exhausting to navigate and doesn‚Äôt really do a good job showing a summary of data all up. Lastly, the idea that the homepage is like a ‚Äúdaily log book‚Äù is not working for me. It‚Äôs totally meaningless with how it currently functions."
4,Colahh,Has lots of great information to help you make informed decisions about how to improve your sleep & overall wellbeing. Though from a woman‚Äôs perspective it focuses on the menstrual cycle & offers no support for women going through perimenopause or beyond. My response from the support team was: The Oura app does not currently support menopause symptom tracking or related tags. It focuses on menstrual cycle phases
2,NatStraci,"I need help!!!! I have the ring and use it to feed data into the Natural Cycles app. The ring simply stopped working last night and it is less than 3 months old. This is not a cheap ring and I have to pay for this app, so the minimum I expect is for the ring to work. I‚Äôve already gone through all of the troubleshooting steps as well. Still not working and I am unsatisfied with this CX to say the least!!"
4,The Real Jackie O (sorry!),I love my Oura ring but have a couple suggestions for the app. 1) how the heck do you not have a pregnancy setting!?! One of the main reasons I got the ring was for cycle tracking and now that I‚Äôm pregnant it would be ideal to store that info. Seems like a huge miss for a health focused app. 2) allow the user to hover/scroll on sleep times like the Fitbit app.
3,svaruag,"App itself works great, and does the things that are advertised.  However, it seems to be using the location all the time (indicated by the GPS arrow on the iPhones) - this is a huge battery drain. I had to turn off the location permissions of the app to get some juice back, although that defeats the purpose of tracking my routes when walking or running outdoors."
1,Boca53,"My wife has the gen 2 and loves it. She bought me a ring for Christmas not understanding that gen 3 is a total money grab. All the stuff she loves is unavailable without the ridiculous monthly subscription.  Who needs another subscription just to make a 300+ dollar thing work. If you are rich and don‚Äôt care about money this is great, if you mind getting ripped off just get a Apple Watch or Samsung watch where the information comes with the product. Seriously this is lamest product. I don‚Äôt even wear it anymore."
3,makende makali,"I‚Äôm a nerd on stress. I geeked out on this device measuring stress and realized that every time I smoke my flower vape (good kush), the app interprets me being stressed. I actually feel far from stressed when I‚Äôm high. If I wanted to use these devices to do a study, I wouldn‚Äôt be confident with results using this device to measure stress, maybe HRV and other vitals but not stress which is very interesting. Is it because stress is more subjective?? Idk but 3 stars for being off"
1,Bigperm999,"BEWARE. Nothing takes me off more than when companies program a product from one day to the next to be obsolete to get you to buy the latest version. I have an  2nd gen, 3 yrs old that worked perfectly, beautifully, couldn't be happier. Right up until the next update when they released 4th gen rings. Customer support was an absolute zero help saying that it was my battery. It just so happens  that the 4th gen rings requires a subscription. Imagine that.  I will NEVER buy another Oura ring again."
5,Slimdaisy,"The Oura ring is so comfortable, you barely notice you have it on, unlike wrist options. I have been a user since the beginning, and have gifted and recommended the Oura for my family and friends. The metrics have helped me improve my health, stamina and sleep‚Äîwhich is invaluable to this 65 year old grandma. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,Jvfdkkh,I am stunned that in 2024 somebody sells a product that cannot access my account across multiple devices. Apple Watch can. Fitbit products can. The Oura ring is the only product that you can only use on one device: your iPhone or your iPad but not both. They say it‚Äôs because of issues updating information. That‚Äôs amateur-hour stuff. Like any other well designed tech it should sync across all devices. It‚Äôs 2024 not 2005. Seriously considering returning this $450 low tech ring.
1,Aj267479,"I use it mainly for sleep tracking and detecting a sickness early. Unfortunately the sleep tracking can be inaccurate for those of us that work night shifts. If one of your main sleep cycles (longer than 3 hours) ends after 6pm, then it will count it for the following day. This results in some of my sleep scores being grossly over inflated when I wake up after 6pm. Like the app reporting that I slept 13 hours and giving me a score of over 90 when, in reality, I only slept about 5."
1,Dour333,"I feel scammed. I paid the price for the ring only to find out that there‚Äôs a high subscription cost over and above that just for basic functionality. They should have a basic service for free and some sort of value-added for the subscription. With my garmin, the accompanying app is free. And the Oura, even with the high cost of the subscription, doesn‚Äôt synchronize with the Garmin. I‚Äôll stick with it, but the feeling of being misled leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and the ring will probably capture the effect on my heart rate."
5,146winter,"I‚Äôve had my ring for a few months now. All I can say is wow! This thing is amazing! With all the tracking and information provided you can optimize your daily routines, the battery is good, last 6-7 days on 1 charge and charging only takes few hours, I love mine and never take off"
2,Alxnnnn,"I just got this yesterday, so I hope the experience will get better.  I have gotten some good info from the app so far, but at the moment it is frozen on a video that will not play, and there is no way to exit the video and get back to the Home Screen.  Definitely a flaw!  I don't know how I'll ever escape... maybe delete app altogether and download again?  But then I'd lose the little data it has on me so far.  Quite annoying!"
1,101ranger,Ever since I upgraded to the newest version of the app it crashes on the consent page. I have owned the ring for close to two years and it is very disheartening that OURA hasn‚Äôt done anything to fix the issues everyone is bringing up. I guess this is their way to boot all of the long time customers who bought in early to the company and haven‚Äôt jumped on the ridiculous subscription plan. I read somewhere there may be a lawsuit in the works stemming from the lack of product support.
5,zooommbbiieess,"Great for sleep tracking but I wish it would present data that it can collect better when I‚Äôm not sleeping (Heart rate while exercising, etc).  Another positive is that it‚Äôs integrated into Apple Heath! (Unlike the Fitbit which doesn‚Äôt sync to Apple Health)  I‚Äôll probably buy a Apple Watch for exercise tracking during the day use the Oura only at night."
5,Graft_hopper,I love my ring and love how it helps me track my strain to rest ratio. I‚Äôm very fond of its ability to let me know what sleep and lifestyle habits work for better rest and what don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm very fond of it only needing charged once a week or so.   My only complaint is that it seems to not care much for naps. I often take them and it doesn‚Äôt always show up and I‚Äôm not even sure if it incorporates it into my readiness or sleep number.   I get different numbers on distance walked and calories burned vs. my Apple Watch. Something to be addressed.   Tip: don‚Äôt stress about sleep and the million tricks you want to use or worry if you‚Äôre doing everything right. Just sleep
5,Sarablenk,"Oura - the ultimate game changer. I was able to 10x the amount of deep sleep I get through tracking sleep data. I‚Äôm more productive, active and have a happier mood. The app is super easy to use. You can keep it simple and look at basic scores 0-100 but it‚Äôs also interesting to dive deep and check out all the data (all within the app!). It‚Äôs great!"
4,wtfisthisservicecutnameapple?,"Love the ring, love the data, struggle with the app design.  Mix and match interaction patterns and redundant (but not duplicate!) paths to similar stats make navigating it almost impossible to learn. They just released a new structure to remedy some obvious IA failures, but just swapped the old issues in for a set of brand new ones. Hope they find a designer to lay out a clear map for the mess!"
3,jc3478,My app is 50% of the time providing accurate splits and times.    For the same exact walk on other days it will show a random variety of splits and times.  Like today my 4.5 mile walk showed 1.7 miles in a single split for 48 minutes.  However the activity panel had it correctly with over 10k steps and 1hr 23 min  Have others seen this issue.   I have a series 2 ring
4,Mariabel08,"I have had my ring for about 5 months and love it! But my one request is that a button get added to the period log ‚ÄúPeriod Skipped this month‚Äù. The app should have a way to track skipped periods, instead of reminding me everyday that I‚Äôve forgotten to log it. Haha, nope, didn‚Äôt forget!! :)  Thank you to the developers - great app thus far, just this one little request. :)"
4,bells üîî,Please add hiking + elevation tracking to the ‚ÄúRecord a Workout‚Äù feature!   Really like the record workout feature overall. Sometimes i notice that for a longer workout (>1hr) or in places where cell service is not great that the syncing doesn‚Äôt seems to work properly.
5,nikimac70,"I like keeping track of my sleep and don‚Äôt do a ton of exercise so I could get a lot more out of the ring and the app, but I find it worth it. I like that it tells me when to relax and when I‚Äôve gotten good rest. I think it‚Äôs helping me to recognize those things myself, too."
2,RParkerJ,"Oura ring 4 user. So far, this device hasn‚Äôt told me anything I don‚Äôt already know about myself. It‚Äôs terrible at tracking activity and doesn‚Äôt allow you to correct it when it‚Äôs wrong. Can‚Äôt tell when you‚Äôre sleeping or napping. Not sure why there are so many high marks for this app/products. I would not recommend wasting your money on such an expensive item that forces you into a paid, monthly subscription. Get a wrist wearable."
3,TL2277,"The data on the ring was helpful until the release of 4. Now my 3 isn‚Äôt working very well. I tried redoing the walking test, no matter how fast or how slow I walk it says its can‚Äôt get any info to produce a report. Everything is up to date on my end but customer support with Oura Ring isn‚Äôt great and I can‚Äôt get actual support with a human being about this issue."
3,JSanchez40,In less than two years ownership the ring suddenly stopped working. Contacted support and they weren‚Äôt able to help fix. Instead they sent me a beat up replacement full of scratches!!!  The app itself is great. Lots of useful data that really helps provide great insight to your sleep patterns. I was very happy and paying for membership until my ring suddenly stopped working‚Ä¶ ‚òπÔ∏è
1,Meshellatoo,"I absolutely love my oura ring! It‚Äôs amazing! But I am SOOO disappointed that they decided to get greedy and started charging $6 per month to access the app. The $400 ring price (which is a lot considering they only last about a year before you have to buy a new one, I‚Äôm on my 3rd one in 3 years) isn‚Äôt enough, now they are price gauging their customers by sucking them into paying a monthly premium to access the information from the ring on the APP? Greedy and disappointing!"
1,laurel-girl,"I have purchased all three rings, including the very first one. Now, my ring will not hold a charge. I tried and tried to contact product support. Eventually, I heard from them. They gave me a ridiculous set of instructions to be able to prove that I have a problem. I have been unable to implement the hoops I must jump through. So, after all of the investments I have made, I am out of luck. Don‚Äôt purchase this product if you expect a long-lasting workable product."
5,cyclingsteve,I loved Oura until they started taking away services unless you buy the new $300 ring around holiday time. I used the ‚Äòguided moment‚Äô service and they took it away unless you buy the new ring. My ring is not old so I don‚Äôt want to spend more money right now.
5,arlo rep,I have seen improvements in my sleep by tracking and reviewing my habits and tendencies. I have experienced insomnia for years. While I still have nights of terrible sleep they are fewer. By using Oura I have taken more steps to improve my sleep. While a work in progress it is progress.
2,Sleeper 465,"i've had a gen 2 ring for 3 ish years now, being able to see the historical sleep trends (esp in apple health!) has been really nice.  - at this point, app updates are getting so intrusive and CTAs such crap that i read reviews before updating the app or firmware - i work night shift, which makes every single ring recommendation useless. sleep score is just visual noise  i dont care about tags, or mediation or downloading my data. i care how i sleep!! work on that!!! or write about how mass data crunching lets you address 85% of users' needs, and 15% of people will just never get the most out of oura, or set expectations for how much work this ring expects of you, or do /something/ that rewards and identifies your core users, and whether i'm supposed to be one. lord."
5,Hate this pick a nickname,I have had a ring since march 2020. I upgraded last fall and am so so impressed with the ring and all the insight it gives me.  Your customer service is wonderful too. I would love to see a more feminine ring if ever you could though I won‚Äôt mind if you don‚Äôt.  Thanks much
4,KFM Ipod,I have written a review in the past about this and never heard anything back. I wish there was a better or continual update of meditation and sleep stories that are available. I end up having to pay for the calm app to fill my needs. Why can‚Äôt Oura do a better job with this?? It can‚Äôt be that difficult
1,DrDJDr,"I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed to have purchased an upgraded ring only to be blackmailed into a monthly membership or else have a far worse experience than my gen 2. I understand taking away some of the  extras, but fully expected my baseline experience to be inferior. Shame on you! I should have saved the $300 and kept my old ring. I will be discouraging others from making the same mistake until you restore parity with the previous generation."
2,GiacomoD13,"I was a very early adopter of this technology. It originally made a big impact on my life and it has become more sophisticated overtime. I have no complaints about these aspects. My complaint is about the fact that I have to recharge the ring every 48 to 60 hours. Originally I did not have to do that. I know batteries were down overtime but other consumer electronic devices that I own either offered refurbished products or replacements.   They keep telling me that my battery is normal and that it‚Äôs a software issue. And they told me to be patient.  I had a similar problem with my WHOOP, because I was an early adopter there. They sent me a new one on my first notice to them.  Perhaps it‚Äôs time to go back to my WHOOP."
3,MissRed1,"I usually love it but this new update is making it crash so much that I can‚Äôt even open the app anymore. Even restarted my phone but still :/ please fix!  ** Update - they fixed the crashing. Can you also work on adding a pregnancy mode? I‚Äôve had the ring for years. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant, it keeps giving me low scores because of my body temperature and heart rate (normal pregnancy changes). PLEASE ADD A PREGNANCY MODE."
1,DKO91,"The app is crashing. I like the new UI, but, the app itself keep closing itself after I open it. I also am on the latest update as well. If I really want to have it open, I have to uninstall then reinstall the app. Though, I then would need to re-sync the ring, which is annoying. I already did that yesterday, but, after opening the app the next day (today), it went back to crashing after every time I open the app. Can you guys fix this ASAP! Thanks! Keep up the good work!"
5,Cup'aJoe,It is amazing how accurate ≈åURA is. The information and insight into how to improve my sleep and how well I feel to start the day is amazing. Love the messages that accompany the data. It feels like there‚Äôs a buddy helping me . My wife now has the ring also and we compare data each morning.
1,lnsattler,"It has been three months since I reached out to customer service to get my $200 coupon off my new Gen 3 ring, since I purchased the old version about a month before and they gave coupons to incentivize us to upgrade. This coupon came with a deadline and a note that customer service would help with a refund if the link didn‚Äôt work. Just reach out!  I brought Gen 3 full price. Not a single person has helped me, and I‚Äôve received 2 emails collecting info with no further response. I have followed up countless times. I have no refund.   I have never had an experience this terrible with customer service. The includes dealing with comcast/spectrum. My 10 years experience working in customer service is the only thing keeping me from using extremely colorful language.   Awful experience."
4,chinatown warrior,"I would really like the ability to sync my ring with MyFitnessPal or to export my step count from Oura to apple health. Sometimes it randomly logs I did exercise when I didn‚Äôt, and when I actually do some exercise, it doesn‚Äôt catch it, also it doesn‚Äôt have kickboxing as an activities option, only boxing which is not the same."
4,davemh333,"This app is helpful in disciplining one to pay attention to sleep. But I can lay in bed for 30 minutes trying to sleep it will show I fell asleep in 5. Worse, almost every night it will show me awake for long periods when I‚Äôm asleep. I suspect this is because I sleep so lightly. Nevertheless, that‚Äôs a serious shortcoming. Customer service is awful, but many have already commented on that."
3,RK1234567ABC,"I love the ring and all the features. The new update is simple and easier to understand. But in order to access your own personal data, you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. I find this really frustrating and I‚Äôve considering many times switching to another product for this reason."
5,Amy in PHL,I‚Äôve had mine for a bit over 2 years and it‚Äôs become part of me. The guidelines and guided meditations are absolutely wonderful. The ONLY bad part is my finger has calluses where the ring is. It‚Äôs the correct size. I‚Äôm supposing it‚Äôs just because my hand does swell with the heat and I rarely take it off.
4,ClayMoWayHo,Why can‚Äôt you add a workout the next day?  Sometimes I forget to add my workouts in manually and the app will not let you add it after midnight.  This is a very frustrating aspect of Oura that I have discussed with numerous other Oura users. After over 3 years of using this app im suprised this still hasn‚Äôt been addressed.  Thanks
4,Bimi96,"I really love the app (and the ring)! However, I use the app on my iPad Pro and it‚Äôs quite unfortunate that it doesn‚Äôt work in horizontal mode, which would be the most comfortable way of checking huge amount of data. I understand it‚Äôs probably not the most important thing, however it‚Äôs THE missing feature for me. If you could implement it, I would really appreciate it."
1,Hindistudent,Really puzzled my ring has not been working consistently since the last update to the app - it is extremely disappointing and dissatisfying to have such an expensive device and app just totally fail to do its job at all.  I know it still works because it records activity and heart rate during the day - but in the morning nothing is ther for sleep or readiness.  A terrible failure of the core function.  Do not buy this product until it is fixed !!!  Deeply disappointed!!!
1,tammymac12,"If you buy the ring and don‚Äôt pay an additional subscription fee, it‚Äôs a paper weight. I‚Äôve been with Oura since 2020 and can‚Äôt even access my old data without paying them a new subscription ON TOP OF THE PRICE OF THE DEVICE. I hear their competitor is great. You still have to pay a subscription but at least the ring is free. And Apple Watch will do everything they do plus more. I‚Äôve used my platform to rave about this ring and now I have to warn my listeners. STAY FAR AWAY!!!"
1,Rohituh,"Tried for 2 weeks, it may be good for sleep monitoring, but activity and heart rate is not useful. It even counts steps while you are driving. One day I wake up with 40 steps. 100 steps for 30 min drive. So it make you feel better by telling you more more calories you burn then you actually do. Took some time to get it on mail, shipped from Europe. When I submit a request for return it took few days for them to return my request and they ask you to pay for return shipping. Not worth the money and it‚Äôs a bad product."
5,phebes66,Does anyone else have issues when trying to apply any updates it takes forever or just stalls and has a half circle with the stop symbol in the middle. This happens every time and it never finishes? This is on every update.
4,To much ads!!,I have really been able to improve my sleep which is great. I am doubtful however on the accuracy of the activity tracker- step count. I think it is a bit sensitive and tends to count every movement as a step. Being that it is a ring I am sure the constant hand movements makes this difficult.
5,suggest a name then,Oura responded to complaints about the recent UI change that expanded the screen space needed to see the summary of sleep and readiness elements that caused you to need to scroll to see all elements. Now the summaries fit on the screen without a need to scroll. Thanks!!!
2,Acarrrrrreraaaa,"I had such high hopes for Oura but after about 3 weeks of using I do not find the data useful, the ring is cheap looking and the app isn‚Äôt well designed. There is a lot of unnecessary nonsense with too many taps to find things. I will not be subscribing, if they offered a lower tier sub for like 2.99 for activity tracking I would maybe subscribe but it‚Äôs just not worth the money and the ring is chunky. Overall, i wouldn‚Äôt waste your money."
5,PatriciaNeal,I have learned so much about my sleep and what I can do to improve it. Really enjoy and appreciate all aspects of this ring. Constantly showing it (and the material generated on my iPhone) to friends and highly recommend.  I am also amazed and pleased at the responsiveness to my questions. Thanks! Patricia
5,Jenga2100,"App won‚Äôt open. It crashes immediately upon selecting it to open.  Rebooting the device does not resolve.  The app has to be deleted and then reinstalled to resolve the issue. In the past week, the app has to be deleted and reinstalled twice."
4,brownt4,"The ring has really enhanced my awareness of my body in many ways, particularly sleep. The only frustrating thing about the app is that every time I try to start an unguided meditation it starts playing the sleep story I had on the night before. Please fix. I‚Äôm unable to use the meditation feature right now."
5,XVVXMCCM,The only problem that I experienced is that the ring sometimes takes up to a minute to connect to the phone to sync. Other than that the app as well as the service of oura are absolutely outstanding.
1,tired person number 1000,"This is a $300 smart ring. They recently changed how they do customer support. It is now outsourced to god knows where, and you will be stuck in unproductive exchanges with uninformed people who are mainly there to cut and paste at you. This is unacceptably poor support for such an expensive piece of hardware. Oura is going the way of Fitbit and it‚Äôs sad. I have used multiple generations of their rings and will not be purchasing another in the future because of the instability of the app and incompetent customer service. They sold us out."
2,orangewolf13,Oura app works fine unless you need help or something is incorrect. There is apparently no way to edit things. The bot they use for support is very inaccurate. It shows text and screenshots that do not match each other and neither one matches the app. Ask how to edit an obviously wrong sleep report? It tells you how step by step how to do it in a version of the app that doesn‚Äôt exist. I know llms are popular but this one is garbage.
2,Mike L - BH,"Oura went from being a valuable tool to being an irritation. It‚Äôs screens are now cluttered with low-value content, and the ring‚Äôs increased power consumption now doesn‚Äôt provide adequate warning that it needs charging on its special charging device. For iPhone users its failure to conform to the standard of ‚Äúonly when using the app‚Äù means it consumes excessive battery power in location services .  Apple‚Äôs tools provide as much value."
5,PuraVida16,This is the best product I have bought in the past year.  There is nothing I can add to this review that others have not already said.  This is my gift for 2021 to all of my friends and family.  I have given our four rings in addition to the one I wear daily.  Everyone LOVES it!!!!
2,PisteOffTele,"I have had this ring and the app for over a year now, and when it works, the information is great!  But the app is very glitchy: - by far, the most annoying issue is that the app and phone lose connection with the ring frequently. To resolve, you have to uninstall the app, forget the Bluetooth connection, and start over. I am doing this about once a month now. Customer support has not been helpful to date. - sometimes it tracks, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. They make it sound like it does all the time, but it doesn‚Äôt. - The battery! Oh, my Lord, this app drains your battery. Especially if the app is supposed to be tracking.   Lots of room for improvement, but a decent app when it works."
2,Lyndaha1114,"I've had two rings in the last year. They both crapped out and won't hold a charge for more than 2 days.  Waiting to see if Oura will send me a new one based on their warranty policy but if dies again, I'm outta luck and money. I won't be buying another one. This seems to be a common issue.  The app, the concept, all of it is super cool. I do like the ring BUT if I have to charge it every othernsay, it's not quite inconvenient."
5,lockaloon,"I mainly got this because 2  squabbling moronic childish CEOs can‚Äôt come to an agreement about blood oxygen. And you know who you are! 2 extremely important things, add a heart rate and blood oxygen spot check to my Apple Watch app. PLEASE ADD THOSE!!! Other then that I am Happy with both my gen3 and gen4 models. Amazing tech and thank your engineers for me."
5,lhdtfgh,I love my hours ring but they recently made changes to the workout summary that are disappointing. The average time for the whole workout is still there but the average time for each mile is gone. Oura can we add that back???
5,crystal_castle,"In today‚Äôs world of gadgets and data it‚Äôs harder to stand out, yet Oura manages to stand WAY out. The product and the Oura support team are truly exceptional.  I‚Äôve played around with several other leading bio tracker brands and when it comes to sleep Oura‚Äôs data has been the most consistent and useful for me."
1,Rooooo777,App and UX is extremely poorly designed from a functional usability vantage point - I cannot figure out how to buy a membership in the app even though I have to purchase one to get data that I want to view. I cannot understand how whoever is the management of this company hasn‚Äôt made it easier for customers to purchase membership within the app. This app struggles to provide useful feedback on how to improve sleep. It is a very frustrating experience to use this product.
3,NicoMcLane,"I love my Oura ring! I wanted to start on a positive note because lately I guess in the past week my ring hasn‚Äôt been lasting a day on a full charge! I lost two nights of sleep data now because it was fully charged in the morning but by the time I wake up the next day, it‚Äôs already at like 2%! What did you guys do in that last update because I‚Äôm not happy now"
5,GoodSlice,"This is one of those apps/products that becomes an important part of your life. I use it everyday without fail, and have used it to optimize my sleep (I now average in the 90‚Äôs, which is no where near where I started). I recommend Oura to everyone I know."
5,Dorena Rode,It no longer makes a tone at the end of taking a moment.  Need this back.   My husband contacted customer support and they replied within an hour indicating they were aware of the issue and working on it.    Otherwise this is a great application.
3,Mrsgossage,"Every night it shows that my readiness is low and that my resting heart rate was elevated but the app doesn‚Äôt take into account that I‚Äôm currently pregnant and because of that, your resting heart rate DOES elevate because your body is pumping 30-50% more blood. Its annoying that you cant tell the app about a pregnancy or a current medical condition so that it can adjust your readiness baseline levels accordingly."
5,ESVA Boothes,"Fantastic level of data for sleep tracking. I wish the step tracker was not as sensitive (counts steps when steering the riding lawnmower or boat) and I wish I could get a heart rate when working out. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great health tracker! An AWESOME thing to own if you‚Äôre someone that likes to wear a real watch. Apple should buy this company."
5,RobA65,"The best, and most important, health tool I have ever owned. Absolutely life-changing for managing and improving my health. If you have any area of your health that you‚Äôre trying to manage‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a chronic illness or simply optimizing your athletic endeavors, this device is MUST HAVE, in my opinion. This synced with Cronometer takes things to yet another level."
5,Ghkkkh,Can you please add notifications options to let you know when you‚Äôre stressed and or relaxed?  I think it would be cool to have the option to get real time notifications so you can adapt quickly
5,AppUgh,"My app has not been able to save a meal since Wednesday. When I tap ‚Äúsave‚Äù for a dinner input, it will not save. It was not saving anything on Thursday at the time of the meal, but finally did save a breakfast and lunch later. Today, Friday, it will not save dinner for today or yesterday."
5,Gogva,I am a senior citizen and this is my second oura ring. I love everything it offers in terms of allowing me to better my health in a positive and constant manner. Thank you Oura creators for this amazing device and all the improvements you continue to make. It has been a life changer for me.
3,Madygirl25,I have to go to bed early like around 8:00 pm. I know I fall asleep soon after and sleep all night. I get up at 5 am to work a hard day. When I check my Oura ring it‚Äôll show I that I slept 5 hrs.  So it looks like it‚Äôs not taking into account the sleep I got before 12 am.  This is the reason for only 3 stars. In my opinion if this is somehow fixed this would be a 6 star product
2,jtmann05,"App is mostly okay, but pretty bare bones.  Apple integration is finally decent, but not as good as some other apps.  Biggest issue is probably the product itself.  Battery went to crap after warranty expired and now dies during the middle of the night, despite requiring daily charging.  Lastly, I refuse to upgrade as I‚Äôm not going to pay a subscription fee.  Either charge for the device or charge subscription fees.  Not both."
1,Blancoborn,"Ring never records naps or sleep prior to midnight each night. It suggests I go to be early. I do. Each night it‚Äôs the same. All sleep is lost and only sleep recorded after midnight is shown. I went to bed at 9:30 last night and woke after midnight. 2.5 of good sleep. Oura picked up nothing.   Also, regardless of whether you are sleeping or not, if you get up and walk to the bathroom in the night it should record those steps.   Getting very disappointed with this device. I shouldn‚Äôt have to chase it all the time.   OURA support slow and virtually non existent  Not sure why, but the APP on my husbands phone is more current than the one on mine even though the device says the versions are the same  What‚Äôs the point of using the ring for sleep tracking if it doesn‚Äôt work"
4,MCdubbs2019,The app is useful for daytime activity and bedtime alerts. It also helps me track how my sleep has prepared for for the day. I would love to see this app give me a notification when it detects that I am stressed and then offer suggestions on how to resolve the stress. I mostly bought this ring because it tracks stress levels.
2,AGirlHasNoName99,"I don‚Äôt write reviews, but felt I needed to. Great product. Bought my first one a few years back and upgraded several months ago but have yet to be able to use my new ring. I‚Äôve tried several times to connect my new ring but hit a snag every time. I‚Äôve emailed customer service and was told the same thing as provided on the app, the same things I‚Äôve been doing. Very disappointed."
2,Christmath,"I asked my family for the Oura ring for Christmas 2019, specifically for the HRV values which were great. Then over summer the ring stopped uploading its data without placing the ring in its charger. If you don‚Äôt upload daily, the data from the night is lost. Every day I have to remember to put it on the charger to get the nights data, and then remember to put the ring back on. I was wearing Oura and Fitbit HR except showering, but I haven‚Äôt put the ring on in a week or so."
4,JuicyDisco,It‚Äôs such a good product and the app works so well. But a $350 price point you don‚Äôt think you would have to continually pay a subscription fee to give you access to the data that it‚Äôs giving off. Besides that I love the app and product
2,Sksenia,"Who thought this app design update was necessary? It‚Äôs hard to navigate between dates, no access to overall calendar other than trands. You can access previous data data in each tab instead of seeing overview of the previous days all in one tab. Please revert back to the original app design. I‚Äôve been barely logging in because I hate navigating along this messy dashboard."
1,lena 199999,"I bought a ring. in the end it doesn't work because I also have to buy a subscription. What else should I buy just to see my sleep indicators, for which I already paid $400? Can I still buy a new house for the owner of Oura? why do I have to pay for a subscription to make my ring work? this is the same nonsense as buying a Mercedes and then paying in a special application in order to have the right to drive it... Well, buy this thing!!! this is a money scam üò°üò°üò°üò°"
3,SkuzaSteve,"I think the Whoop, personally, is more accurate and provides overall better data.  Most days, my ring doesn‚Äôt pick up my Peloton/Tonal workouts through Apple, and it creates all kinds of misinformation.   My favorite parts about the Oura ring are the period predictions and the style/look; which, in my case, I‚Äôm more interested with the ring actually working correctly."
2,C02118,I have removed the app. I have reset my device. I have put the app on a different device. I cannot get out of the spin cycle of looking for a ring to get back to my homepage. I also tried logging onto the web. Customer service =  an email back that has the same pasted in text and does not address my question. I am on my second ring. These are expensive and I am unsatisfied.
3,SonjSonjinhaSonjita,"Overall good experience with the app, however, I‚Äôm frustrated the Circles feature does not work between my husband and I.  I‚Äôve written into Oura help, and the only recommendation they had for me was to delete the circle, delete the app, re-download the app and re create the circle - which we have done and the issue has not been solved.  So support is only so so :("
2,marveyg,I‚Äôve been an Oura customer for over 4 years and have had a smooth routine uploading data every morning until recently when App crashes every 3 days and I have to delete and reload. I live off grid so I enjoyed being able to get data and charge ring without WIFI. Now it‚Äôs a struggle to see my data consistently and I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôll have to give up using my ring.
5,gatorfan63,My husband and I have had our ring about a month and a half. My husband is obsessed with it monitoring his sleeping. I had to threaten to take it away if he didn‚Äôt stop telling me every morning how much he slept and everything. I love it because it lets me add in workouts. Great invention.
5,Sky7walker,Any chance you can add Rucking as an activity with the ability to add the amount of weight one is carrying?   Rucking is a form of exercise that involves walking or hiking while carrying a weighted backpack. It originated from military training where soldiers would carry heavy packs over long distances to improve their endurance and strength.
3,readywater,"The Oura ring is fantastic, and it‚Äôs probably my favourite wearable (in order of Oura, Garson Fenix, then Apple Watch as last). However, the software continues to be poor kind of weak w/ a product vision that I don‚Äôt really buy into.   For me, the dream would be: a) IOS app with native widgets for key graphs b) API for own analysis/integrations c) Customizable app landing page so you could tailor the initial screen to specific graphs.  For that customization side, I think that could help resolve the variability in users‚Äô mental model of what Oura provides via a smart onboarding that could help you tailor that dashboard/desired services. There‚Äôs an extension to the biz model there as well wherein additional services could be up sold to new customers."
1,elmo5676,"I used to love this app. The ring hardware is great and the app used to be very easy to navigate and use. With this latest version, it just became extremely cluttered and incredibly hard to figure out what‚Äôs going on. Plus, the graphs are completely useless. There‚Äôs no fidelity or fine grain detail. It‚Äôs just a mess. It also has stopped tracking my naps. I don‚Äôt know why they did this. The previous version was great and intuitive. This version needs a lot of work."
5,Char333$,"I have had my ring for a long long time!   One of the features I love is being able to bathe without the need to remove the ring.  My only negative is that I play senior women‚Äôs basketball, and I remove my Oura for practice in case I jam a finger.  Otherwise, if my ring is not charging, I am wearing it!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Perslane,I love how Oura keeps me on track with constant feedback and updates. I like knowing when to take it easy and when I can crank it up. I feel more motivated to get enough sleep after wearing Oura and more inclined to get my activity levels up!
1,Turbotj,"The ring is great. The app has the worst UI I have ever seen. For example, figuring out how to turn on the blood oxygen sensing took two engineers and a few internet searches to find. It‚Äôs not clear what‚Äôs a resource and what‚Äôs your data.   I recommend like 3 tabs. One for info from your ring, one for ring settings and one with resources on improving your sleep or whatever. It doesn‚Äôt need to be this complicated.   I still can‚Äôt tell what I‚Äôm looking at half the time. Add some context."
2,AMWKNW,"It‚Äôs really disappointing that after owning 3 different generations of Oura Rings the experience is getting worse. Avg customer service response has been 30+ days, with most recent inquiry over ‚Äúlost‚Äù or changing sleep data was 4/11 and with first response  coming on 6/17 quoting white papers that say Oura is the Gold standard. It‚Äôs sad to see such a promising company and product so disappointing. I‚Äôm currently comparing alternatives and will likely discontinue"
3,oura dissatisfaction,"I got my oura  9 months ago , I would look at it daily when I woke up , but I‚Äôve been finding that when I wake up the app isn‚Äôt working like it used to be , and I have to charge my ring almost daily , pretty disappointing, and then i keep getting texts etc to buy the new one but haven‚Äôt been able to fully use the first one yet for one full year yet ü§®"
5,Night Owl69,Love this ring. The only thing not making it a five star is the fact that there is no way to tell the developers that I am a night owl - always have been. It constantly tells me that my sleep is not in compliance with natural rhythms. I‚Äôm perfectly in tune with my natural rhythms. üòâ
2,TinyDancer6913,"App is ok but can be confusing . What disappoints me most is all of the sleep audio recordings in the explore section of the app are all of people talking ! They used to have one with just music which is more relaxing then hearing someone‚Äôs voice ! Please bring this back , since they removed this feature I now I find this section of the app to be useless."
4,Z. Quinn,Thank you for updating the UI so the sleep sections aren‚Äôt giant anymore. New issue is the ring has been thinking I‚Äôm awake when I‚Äôm not. This has happened several times the last week. I‚Äôve had 3 Oura rings and this has never been an issue until now. Hopefully an update is coming soon.
5,lex2004:),"My fianc√© has seizures and it‚Äôs really important to track his sleep and heart rate as well. It has helped us so much. I have one as well and it really has helped me, coming from someone with anxiety knowing what my heart rate is means a lot to me. It calms me down and gives me some relief."
4,sbridabc,Like the features on the ring but the battery went bad after 6 months. Now instead of charging it once a week I have to charge it twice a day. Maybe the new version has a better battery that will last. Still like using it.
1,BobbyParker,"Two of my three Oura rings stopped working. After three weeks of trying to get a reply from their support, I decided to mark it up as a lesson learned. I read many ‚Äúno support‚Äù messages, going back a year or so, and still chose to purchase. Today, I'm reading many messages of people trying to get support for much longer, so to avoid the frustration, I'm walking away. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake as I did. A company that doesn‚Äôt support its product needs to stop selling it."
5,Mr. Zurkon,"The hardware and the app both are great, and combined they provide valuable insight unlike any other fitness platform I‚Äôve seen. Excellent and timely analysis - with actionable suggestions. Fantastic product and I hope Oura keeps innovating and adding new features for us! Thanks so much! :)"
3,AnnetteTrader,This ring would be great if it lasted. I make sure it‚Äôs fully charged before bedtime and it‚Äôs dead before morning. No data captured. The 1st ring died within the first year so I received a replacement. The 2nd ring died after a year and since my original purchase date was more than 2 years it was not eligible for warranty replacement. Sorry but I don‚Äôt want to have to buy a new ring every two years. Not replacing.
1,chmod7000,"Oura is expensive for what it does, so I expected quality and reliability. Not the case.  Ring randomly stopped connecting to my phone, theres no way to get debug info out of the ring, have been stuck divining what could be wrong via LED colors. Replacement process also cumbersome and support makes you redo debugging youve already done. Save yourself money and time - get a smart watch instead!  Adding insult to injury, you still get charged $6/month for the experience!"
1,glibrodo,"The 3rd gen ring is useless if you don‚Äôt pay $5.99 monthly subscription. What the app will tell you are just scores for ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù, ‚Äúsleep‚Äù and ‚Äúactivity‚Äù numbers which don‚Äôt mean anything.   Imagine your Apple Watch holding hostage your heart rate data, how much sleep you‚Äôre getting g or the number of steps daily unless you pay more money.  I wish I found out about this earlier.   Return the ring and get a refund. Don‚Äôt fall for the free 6 months subscription."
1,Noratypical,"As Oura pushes Gen 2 users to upgrade to gen 3, it appears that they‚Äôve undone previous optimizations to adjust for hormone fluctuations in users with periods. (My luteal phase is now registering as sickness, when it‚Äôs just natural cyclical changes to body temp and HRV.) My guess is that this is to force people into the gen 3 period tracking feature, but is effectively discrimination on the basis of sex‚Äî people with periods now have to pay more than other users to get accurate biometrics tracking."
5,T78028,I love how easy it is to track different things with the Oura Ring.  It‚Äôs super easy and user-friendly to go between the various screens and look at certain things.   I also love how it can sync with other apps for additional tracking .
4,Mike Peltz,It‚Äôs great when it works. It‚Äôs been dead for a few weeks now and customer service is horrible. They continue to tell me to do the same basic stuff. Tap three times reboot your phone etc. I would love to be able to actually use the ring and give a great review.  Update: They have sent me a new ring. So far so good!
1,N N Nickname,"I had to return my ring; it was slightly too large thus certain features aren‚Äôt functional.   Though when I go into the Membership plans to temporarily cancel the account, there‚Äôs no option. I‚Äôm now facing the prospect of deleting my entire account or forcing a chargeback when they auto bill.  Just another terrible payment experience that for some reason forces users into bad positions. Make membership clearer! Allow cancelation from anywhere at any time!"
1,Takysirl,"A known bug makes the data inconsistently available, if at all. There is a cost for the app, and despite wearing the ring all the time I‚Äôm constantly not getting access to all of the data because of a known issue that hasn‚Äôt been resolved and has no known resolution date. DO NOT PURCHASE. It‚Äôs a waste of money and there are better/other wearables that give you the same data without the monthly cost of the app. Support isn‚Äôt great either."
4,Shiny Hunt,I originally gave a harsh review since the monthly subscription fee was initiated. But have reconsidered. Oura does what it does well and it does it in a form factor that not many companies can do. I appreciate it‚Äôs conviene and ease of use and lightness. The monthly payment is still kind of a bummer but I‚Äôm excited to see where the company goes.
1,drew-jitsu,"The v2 is expensive, but legit. The device itself is $400+ dollars but alright - lots of tech and hardware involved. Even better, you get to see your data. Now you continue to pay the ransom or it‚Äôs a $400 decoration on your finger. It won‚Äôt even function to the level of that the v2 does. It‚Äôs nearly useless.  I‚Äôm all for premium features and debating if it‚Äôs worth the monthly cost, but this thing does nothing without paying the ransom.  Going to check the return policy."
4,Becky55896,"Fun app for insights into sleep and activity patterns, wearable is amazing how much tech in such a tiny comfortable package.   Some quirks in the app, really annoying that can‚Äôt delete a nap if inadvertently confirmed, and can only record live workout heart rate for four activities (even just an ‚Äúother‚Äù category would be nice to have the data)."
3,aussy3112,"I absolutely love the ring and all the data that it provides. Especially the sleep tracking  The app has so much content and is awesome when it works. Unfortunately I have to delete the app at least once a week. It continually crashes or simply will not open. Oura you have such a great product, do it justice by fixing the app please."
1,Alyosh,If ring is little loose when we sleep it calculates as awake time because it also show gaps for resting heart rate chart exactly at the same time interval. You mentioned before the gaps in heart rate chart is may be the ring become loose so how you can make sleep as awake just because the ring is loose ?  whole data is screwed up because of this miscalculation. Even after several messages about this response is none not sure if they even have support to report issues as they don‚Äôt even respond.
5,AlltheLiveMusic,This thing is great until a fully charged battery dies in the middle of the night over and over again.  What‚Äôs the point of having a sleep tracker if you can‚Äôt track your sleep?!
2,PhillyDude01,"I tried to use my treadmill to perform the new cardio fitness test and after wasting six minutes walking, the app advised me it couldn‚Äôt measure fitness because it couldn‚Äôt measure the route and distance traveled. Excuse me? Can you make that clear BEFOREHAND next time? It‚Äôs 95 degrees outside and temps have been over 90 degrees every day so far this month. I doubt I‚Äôll be able to perform this test anytime soon if outdoor walking is mandatory."
3,SarahNick9886,I love having the data behind the ring and seeing how what changes I make in my life can impact my sleep scores. Unfortunately they can‚Äôt keep the app updated and there are multiple stories of it crashing. I haven‚Äôt been able to open the app for two weeks despite being a paying customer
1,rhoadesc,"The app takes forever to get data from the ring. Like 5 full minutes that you have to keep the app open and just look at a loading screen. Also, it provides no feedback voluntarily. You have to figure out what it suggests by analyzing their complicated data. Alerts of steps, suggested sleep changes etc would be nice but it does none of that.  It‚Äôs 2022, you should have to go into an app and wait for data."
1,ksparr0,"(Update to earlier review) Getting stuck on the update firmware screen has something to do with the app, not the ring. I have a really old iPad which installed an older version of the app (new version is for iOS 13+), and the app was able to proceed and find/pair the ring. So‚Ä¶huge thumbs down to both the app developers and the people who thought whacking a tech device on a hard surface multiple times to reset it was a good idea (which didn‚Äôt work anyway)."
4,Hmgoins,I have had my ring for about 6 months now and I love it. My only issue is since the last update the app crashes before the data upload is complete. This has been going on for about a week - I tried uninstalling the app but not having any luck! Please fix soon! :)
3,Megant2122,I wish they had a better way to log your period. It‚Äôs confusing to not have an end date. Or when dates when you are ovulating. Also why is there not a way to track your ring when it‚Äôs lost. It has Bluetooth so why am I not able to find my ring within the app.
2,123badchange,"The app update really messed up a good thing.  Oura needs to leave well enough alone.  There new update is terrible all it does is expand a bunch of nonsense for information already there.  They made it confusing and difficult to operate.  I have worn a Oura ring for about 3 years, really thinking about changing now.  Check out the others before you buy."
2,COSrunr,"Has lots of notifications, like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre close to your goal‚Äù that are meaningless drivel, and worse it sends them to pop up while you‚Äôre using the app, interrupting what you actually wanted to do.  But if you turn off notifications you won‚Äôt get the one you really need, reminding you to recharge the ring.  I guess the programmers don‚Äôt actually use the app"
2,jw77339,"It‚Äôs actually crazy that you have to open the app to get the ring to sync/upload data. Makes it even worse that the sync itself takes several minutes every time, and doesn‚Äôt even do it successfully each time. Team has a lot of work to do to make this an asset, it‚Äôs more of an inconvenience at this point. Only use it now so my $300+ isn‚Äôt wasted."
1,Sunnybricks,Oura is corporate greed at its finest. I spent almost $500 on a ring which is essentially just a piece of useless plastic if I don‚Äôt spend $6 a month to be able use the software. Plus an extra $15 a month to track my cycle. What a bunch of pink tax trash. There really isn‚Äôt any information that interesting on this to justify the price tag. I would keep it if it was a one time purchase of the ring but subscription fatigue is just way too strong these days.
5,Davon101,"As a entrepreneur the OURA Ring a must! It shows you actually how much sleep you are getting, your recovery HR/HRV, your REM, your trending sleeping stats, it gives you recommendations to ease off training when your body hasn‚Äôt recovered yet, it add years to your life by you getting healthier sleep & focusing more on your activity levels/recovery."
3,Mike Shyu,"The app is prone to crash on startup every time it goes through a patch update in the App Store.   In order to fix this I need to delete the app and reinstall it and pair the ring again.   The first time this happened was an annoyance. Now for the 20+ times I‚Äôve had to do this, it is annoying and frustrating."
2,Yogini1o8,"The latest update that changed the view of the sleep score, readiness etc is a step back.  Why are we unable now to see everything at a glance?  Instead we have to scroll down and it‚Äôs disjointed.  Please go back to allowing view of everything in one sweep.   I don‚Äôt need to spend an additional 5-10 minutes trying to make sense of my data."
5,Ester.miklos,I love this app and the ring. That is amazing! However I really wish the widget were better. The only reason I‚Äôm writing this review is in hopes that the developers would see this and make a step counting widget or an activity widget of some kind.
4,Jennifer1975,"I have been using Oura since 2020 and love it. However, it does not tell me to charge my ring before bed and I will have 30-40% battery, use airplane mode at night and wake up with NO READINESS SCORE DUE TO LOW BATTERY! Then it alerts me to charge. Missing data and super frustrating."
5,Skibeegeebee,I‚Äôve had my ring now for over a year and I have to say it‚Äôs changed my life for the better. Unlike the fitness watches and bands I‚Äôve used in the past it‚Äôs less intrusive and it‚Äôs myriad of features so very helpful in giving positive guidance in fitness sleep and mental attitude. Highly recommended.
4,huhh?,I was thoroughly enjoying this app but am sorry I downloaded this most recent update. Since then all my ‚Äúadded workouts‚Äù have disappeared from my daily Activity Summary‚Äîall of them from when I started using my ring in December! I contacted Help and have heard nothing!
3,1STPKLSR,"Oura ring is a great product. I owned the 1st gen ring and now have the 3rd. The app is great too‚Ä¶ except for the consistent crashing.  I have had to delete the app, reinstall and go through the process to reconnect the ring more times than I wish to count.  It is almost to the point where I am done with the ring‚Ä¶ and I love it."
1,BBR8765,"HRV, temperature, resting heart rate, Sp02 and perhaps others are not added to apple health.   Spo2 actually doesn‚Äôt work at all and isn‚Äôt in the app anywhere despite the false claims on their website that the new $300 gen 3 ring has it.  There is also a subscription scam where you have to pay $6 per month just to access your own data off the ring you ‚Äúown‚Äù.  Did they purposely cripple Apple Health integration because of this? Highway robbery!!!"
3,Sharpie7072,"I started out loving this ring because it tracked more accurately than my Apple Watch and would detect workouts without me having to select that I‚Äôm doing one.  The last month, the accuracy has gone out the window. It doesn‚Äôt record anything accurately including activity and sleep. Not sure I‚Äôll be wearing it much longer."
3,Hm1217,"I love my ring and the app is sleek, intuitive and most importantly effective. Only things missing are ability to retroactively add workouts/activities (I don‚Äôt always remember to check that it recorded them all automatically before bed) and ability to see your absolute body temperatures (vs only the relative ones)"
3,elmofudge,I had no problems with the gen2 ring. But with the gen3 and app update the imported Apple Watch workout data isn‚Äôt reflected correctly. For example I had a workout with 367 calories come from Apple Watch data. Oura says I burned 142?!  I then create a fake workout in oura and somehow that makes the app adjust to a correct calorie readout . Buggy.
5,FatBottomedGirl18,"I love this tracker - wayyyyyy better than any bracelet and allows me To wear my watches again. I am obsessed with the stats on the app and have a major crush on Oren, who guides me to sleep every night with his sleep mediation.   The one thing I would like to see (boys cover your eyes) is the period data - I track the cycle, but haven‚Äôt seen where I can see the history, also, it would be nice to be able to track the flow.   I love seeing other Oura twins put in the world, it‚Äôs like we are part of a secret society - we need a handshake or something!"
4,Krism112,"I‚Äôm a nurse who works night shift. While I love the features Oura provides, I wish it took more specific consideration for the 20% of the population working nightshift. This would also serve as a great opportunity to study our habits/trends bc lord knows we need all the help we can get! (With consent of course!!)"
1,Jruss8,"I was genuinely excited to use the Oura ring after hearing so much about its features and potential benefits. However, my experience was marred by the short lifespan of the product.   My first ring was a Gen2 and it stopped charging after a year. Oura replaced the ring with a Gen3 since it was in warranty. My Gen3 stopped working after 11 months. Oura would not replace the ring because my warranty was tied to my Gen2 purchase date.  For the price point, I expected a device that would last much longer. To add insult to injury, the warranty offered is insufficient given the ring is prone to issues.   It‚Äôs frustrating to invest in a health-focused product only to face durability and warranty concerns. I‚Äôd think twice before purchasing again."
1,Led65,"I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with Oura lately, but since mid June the only a few nights of sleep have been transferred to the app and the rest were blank. Now I can‚Äôt even get the app to work. It was frozen so I force closed and reopened it, but now it doesn‚Äôt go past the Oura ring logo before closing. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the app already. I‚Äôm starting to wonder why I am bothering to wear this ring when nothing seems to work anymore."
2,Nickhhjhddhh,"I only play one sport, and when i am asked for activity, i still get defaulted to cycling/walking/other and i have to scroll each and every time to choose tennis.  This started happening with an update about a year ago.   If they cannot figure this out, I am not convinced on the rest of the quality of this product"
1,jacoblanglois,"gating pretty much all data behind a paywall is just gross. So sick of companies feeling entitled to our money, I already paid for the hardware the software should be included, any data generated should belong to me, not you. It's my health information after all, not yours. wish I knew there was a subscription before I bought the ring, otherwise I never would have. I'll probably just chuck this thing in the trash at this point, where it belongs."
4,ikevk,"Product works as well as it possibly could. App works exactly as it should as well. However, some sort of social integration would be awesome. A way to add friends/compare/compete sleep scores would be a massive improvement, similar to what fitbit offered."
1,Boris Solomon,"This happens after every other upgrade, the app stops opening and then I need to delete and go thru the whole process to set up. It‚Äôs getting really annoying, I have reached out to tech with this issue in the past. I guess it‚Äôs time to start looking for a better product. Waste of time to set up new ring after every app upgrade. Please update your programmers to create software that works."
5,LaLaPurple,"I love this ring.   It keeps track of my sleep, heart rate and activity.  I wouldn‚Äôt wear a Fitbit or Applewatch ‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even notice I‚Äôm wearing the ring.  I love that it tracks my sleep.  REM Deep or light sleep.  It keeps me aware that I get less sleep than I think.   The new motion sensor for sleep was a good addition!"
5,Kelli_Lovell,I‚Äôve had my ring for over a year now. I had an issue early on but the company was quick to resolve the issue. This app is one of the best apps ever. They constantly update with new features and it has always been applied seamlessly. I love my Oura ring!
1,bratty014,"It is approaching 4 weeks since I bought an oura ring, where I tried to cancel my order only 2 hours after ordering only finding there was no way to do so. No phone number to call, no easy way to cancel online, just had to send an email in where I am STILL waiting dor a response. This is ridiculous. They need to have a way to process cancellations and returns. I get that the holidays are busy but this is insane."
5,MCR@Y,During these crazy times I couldn‚Äôt even imagine how much the data that comes from my Oura ring helps me make sure I‚Äôm staying healthy and not pushing my workouts. Also amazing that it caught a minor temperature spike related to a minor cold I got and recomended taking it easy. Very cool!
5,superbeakie,"Love this app. Consistently gives good feedback on step count and sleep- these are the two I check the most. Wearing the ring gives me freedom from carrying my phone around to get my step count so I was hooked on Oura right away. The app is easy to navigate and has an attractive, modern design."
5,NinjaAttacks,I now know more about myself than ever. The amount of information is impressive. I appreciate Oura‚Äôs technology because it has given me so much power over my health.   I hope that Oura will continue to improve.
3,Phy phi,"i see some good features, but the next day they are gone?  Makes no since why i am aloud to see certain features one day and not the next!  drives me crazy‚Ä¶.dont show me anything that you can keep on the screen 24/7.  i may not need that feature when you decide i should.  keep all features up‚Ä¶."
1,Vidya Madhavan,"I would change my rating if this is fixed : sleep detection is super random and I would like if you provided the users and option to edit it, and overtime if Oura learnt better based on the user corrected sleep ( at least in terms of start and end times) similar to exercise detection. I might be working and then go to sleep 6 hrs later, but still the App picks it up as sleep, and even funnily goes in to categorise that time as REM/ time awake !"
5,nopossiblenewnickname,"I am 68 years old and in the best shape of my life. Being able to reliably monitor your readiness to exercise ,  whether you are sleeping enough andintherightway And receive credible guidance for good health habits is a rare commodity. I‚Äôve tried several ‚Äúbody telemetry‚Äù products ... Oura is the best all around device I‚Äôve used."
3,vmk-jz,Great product as others can vouch for.  But last week's update changed the interface so that everything looks blockier with extra padding between the horizontal bar charts.  So now you have to scroll to get a glance at your your score breakdown in the sleep and readiness  sections.  And things are now harder to see.
4,Love 4 Ever!!,I had this while now. When was little sick it tell me take ie easy and had this um set up to take easy. Didn‚Äôt tell get up or need workout. It‚Äôs was cool that say that. Only thing I  wish the app can also be on iPad too. So we can see it better but other then that the app nice and love my new ring!!!!
3,heighmy,"I love my ring and the app is nice, but it‚Äôs confusing. For example I didn‚Äôt edit my activity properly (I know my bad) but on the website it shows how to edit it but my settings look entirely different. I have tried searching high and low in the app on how to edit a workout and can‚Äôt find anything."
1,magcocoar,"The review as not about the ring because I never got it. I emailed oura ring they tracked the ring to being un-delivered by DHL and then returned by the post office cuz that‚Äôs where DHL states they left to the USPS. DHL never came the day they said. There was so many push back dates, took way longer they say it would arrive. No present communication towards what to do next when a delivery fails on there part. When will get the ring? Or what to do?? I am disappointed, to say the least."
4,Ananda333,I don‚Äôt understand why this super simple feature isn‚Äôt on?  I‚Äôm really excited to use this ring but I got it for the data analysis and the app seems a little too simplistic and minimalist and I would love more access to all my data and to track trends related to custom tags.
5,Fflowergirl,Worn for 2 years now & wouldn‚Äôt  be without it. It‚Äôs helped me see that food a late meal or snacking disrupts my sleep. My sleep has greatly improved and changes in my diet has improved my RHR (resting heart rate) and my HRV (heart rate variable). I store my workouts and it automatically records my steps. It has improved my health totally!
5,oura App,But the Apple App won‚Äôt allow me to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù it due to some technical issue. I‚Äôve sent requests but no response. Hope this reaches someone that can help. I‚Äôm not having any issues updating any other Apps.
4,Oudiveboy,"Love Oura, but the latest update has an obvious bug in it. Even though Strava integration is working, the Strava activity is no longer showing under Summary on the Home Screen.  The joys of coding!  I have reported this and I‚Äôm having a continuing dialogue with Support, but I‚Äôm not convinced they understand what I‚Äôm reporting."
1,Elkapower,"The product launched on the premise that you can get information if you pay for the ring, without a subscription. I have had the Gen 1, and the same applies to the Gen2 ring. I bought the Gen 3 ring, after 30 days the Information stream stopped unless you pay for a subscription. Don‚Äôt fall for the click bate. I don‚Äôt pay twice for Information. Full disclosure they did refund my ring purchase."
1,ThisNicknameIsTaken77,"With the latest update, Oura removed the period prediction feature that has been included since I‚Äôve had my ring, and now they want to charge you to see your own data. Such a scam!!! Wish I could uninstall latest update. Why is Oura feeling the need to nickel and dime me? Oura used my data, perfected their data algorithm, and then locked my own data behind YET ANOTHER paywall. This ring is quickly becoming obsolete in my eyes."
2,turquoise bambi,I bought my ring like four months ago and it took like a month to really start reading my biometrics correctly and then about a month later it stopped noticing when I took naps or when I went on a bike ride so it didn‚Äôt register it. I talked to Support and they just send me the exact same paper about generic troubleshooting things that doesn‚Äôt help me and they don‚Äôt listen
5,vyuyuchan,I love my ouraring but today when I tried to connect ring to new phone I don‚Äôt see sign in option like they said in the instruction.  Only create new account.
4,nickdag,"Minor bug report (looked but couldn‚Äôt find a good way to submit via support site).  I have an up to date app on iPhone XR, and the app doesn‚Äôt correctly maintain the last Moment settings like it should.  There‚Äôs a button to restart previous session, and every time the app does a full restart it resets back to 1 minute.  Thanks!"
3,Lynda Lew,I‚Äôm not too sure how well the ring works because the app is poorly designed. I slept 5.30 hrs last night. Just took a nap but do not see its quality recorded anywhere except it is logged as being added to my sleep time.  I have Pillow app on Apple Watch that gives SO much more usable info. Thank you
1,Ashlynn587,"I‚Äôm so frustrated. I have been waiting to get my ring and it finally arrived today. I‚Äôve tried at least 30 or 40 times to set up an account but after entering in all my info, I return to the app and it says that it‚Äôs unable to verify my account. I reached out to customer service and they gave me a canned email response telling me to reset my password. But I can‚Äôt even get an account to finish setting up. Very upset!"
5,fiziks,"I had an issue with the battery going bad. Product was barely out of warranty, but they were responsive and replaced it anyway. Really happy with the ring. It keeps me on track."
1,S1t2eve,"Doesn‚Äôt record heart rate on a regular basis, sometimes for hours at a time. It would be nice if it would give you some sort of alert that it is not picking up on my heart rate. It gives me alerts to get up and stretch my legs but not that it‚Äôs lost connectivity??? Still within my 30 days so I‚Äôll returning. I love the idea of it and wish it worked. Maybe I‚Äôll buy in a few years when they some of bugs and issues ironed out."
1,Disappointed about Oura,"I bought this ring mainly to track my sleep.  After you finish the free trail they want to charge you $5.49 per month to see your sleep cycles.  This is ridiculous.  I could see charging for the sleep music or other add ons, but to charge for more sleep information is not cool.  Apple and Fitbit don‚Äôt charge to access basic information like this.  Don‚Äôt buy this product.  They need to change this."
3,jscottee,"Version 4.3 added clutter to the interface on the Readiness and Sleep tabs, increasing the size of each metric and adding an unnecessary (i) button for ‚Äúinfo‚Äù.   Why change it? It was simple and intuitive before! I‚Äôd love to see these UI changes rolled back.   Before this update, 5 stars for app functionality + UI design."
3,Monkeybusiness001,"Can not import workout data from apple health consistently. I use garmin for my exercise, and all the activity data is uploaded via garmin connect to apple health. I could see the data records in apple health is correct and complete. But Oura can only sporadically pull data from apple health and count them as my daily activities."
5,elimcswain,"Becoming more aware of my habits, sleep patterns and daily living has allowed me to make the adjustments I need to be more productive and accomplish more in my professional life than I did when I was in my 60‚Äôs.   I am grateful for this instrument of awareness and what it is allowing me to do!  - Eli"
5,Mrsswartz09,I have learned so much about how to sleep better and take care of my body. My favorite thing about Oura is how it encourages me to listen to my body when it needs rest vs activity etc. Truly life changing.
2,mcuvelier,"I‚Äôve had my ring for almost a year now and it has been great. I wear it all day every day and it has been super helpful for dealing with my chronic illness. The recent UI update, however, has nearly rendered the app useless. I‚Äôm seriously considering canceling my subscription until Oura makes changes. It‚Äôs THAT bad. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who is having this experience."
5,Tiffybo,"Ever since I downloaded the new iOS 16 on my iPhone 13, my oura app crashes every time I try to open it, even with the update I did today. My Gen 3 ring is not even a year yet, but is now useless because of the app crashing."
5,GezaDomokos,"I just want to say to whoever came up with the idea of this obscure feature, feel your heartbeat while you hold your finger on the heartrate plot, you are awesome! It‚Äôs the little things that matter! Thanks!"
5,TomElliott,I‚Äôve been waiting since I got an Oura ring for an update that will enable me to take an HRV reading whenever. This would be immensely helpful for gauging how various stress-reducing techniques are actually working. Supposedly it‚Äôs coming but somehow never does. It seems like such a simple update. Will it ever come??
2,crytpoguy,"Please add an alarm feature instead of adding more mediation/sound tracks. The Oura ring is an amazing piece of tech and would be able to wake me up at the perfect time during my sleep cycle without having to wear an Apple Watch like other apps require.  I know it would drain the battery quicker, but that‚Äôs an easy trade off for the much needed added functionality!"
1,iOS 9 user,"This is a warning to those who are considering purchasing this very expensive ring. It is NOT accurate regarding sleep. I have unfortunately stayed up entire nights (many times), and the app/ring shows that I had between 5-6.5 hours of sleep. Not ‚Äúgood‚Äù sleep, however the fact that after over a year of wearing it this thing STILL does not recognize my sleep patterns is a testament to the inaccuracies of the data it‚Äôs purportedly collecting and analyzing.  Shame."
3,Mike carpool,"It‚Äôs not picking up Apple Health data (for instance today it says I have over 3k steps, but Oura says only 52). And it‚Äôs bedtime now so I would have expected it to sync by now.   Also, it has trouble connecting to the ring most times I open the app. Often the second time I open it in a given session. Usually have to close app, and restart Bluetooth on iPhone."
5,yillish,"It is 2024 and Oura still doesn‚Äôt offer MFA (multi factor authentication) for accounts. Security is important! Apart from that everything is great about Oura and their app. But they need to enable MFA (or even better, offer passkey support!)"
1,Oura needs to reflect,"The company should go back to not charging customers a monthly/annual fee to see their data. It‚Äôs wrong that this company sells the customer an expensive piece of equipment and then continues to charge them just to see the data that has been collected.   Oura should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of loyal customers, when other equipment is available without a subscription and better at presenting data."
5,donkirk73,Update. The app now works fine. Just had to delete it and reinstall it. Didn‚Äôt lose my data or anything.
3,Somanyfun,The step tracker is way off.  And the workout is fine but not that accurate.  App is pretty cool with the stress stuff. I bought this because I was tired of my Apple Watch and wanted to disconnect sometimes but looks like I need it anyway with the steps and activity. Had a lot of hope for this
3,JesterMike,I‚Äôve used this device and previous Generation since 2019 and was pretty happy.  Over the last several months I‚Äôve found that my Gen 3 needs to be charged every two days which is simply too much - I have enough devices to charge daily.
3,michele__p,"I‚Äôve loved my oura ring and have worn it everyday for almost 3 years- Sadly, ever since the most recent update to the app/ring, my ring stopped being discoverable via Bluetooth and I am no longer able to connect my ring to my phone. It won‚Äôt even appear on the Bluetooth devices list."
5,Earlyriser7777777,I‚Äôve had my ring for about a year now and love it and all the tracking metrics.  I do wish it tracked all activity after midnight versus starting at 4:00 am. It would be great if that could be adjusted.
3,ipm45,"Love the Ring, customer service horrible.  My ring, gen 3 gold, got to where it wouldn‚Äôt stay charged barely a day, then dead.  I wrote to customer service several times with the information needed and they never replaced the ring or offer a discount on a new one.  Nothing."
5,A real review set,"I rarely review apps, but this one is phenomenal and gets better all the time. The ring and insights from this app improved my health and wellness significantly. I am grateful to the oura team for investing expertly in their product and customers."
4,Prof Rial,"Things I wish I could change: be able to remove all things related to birth, menses, etc. Also the new ‚Äòstress tracker‚Äô is something I would like to turn off. With POTS, any time I stand up is marked as ‚Äòstress‚Äô. It is unable to track when I am actually stressed."
3,hgdhmm5,"When this app crashes all the ring‚Äôs current data is permanently lost.  I think updating every day is essential to limit the loss.  I suppose it‚Äôs hard to create an app that works perfectly, but not prematurely deleting all the data off the ring itself ought to be easy."
4,Projoy,This app is lovely with one glaring exception. I‚Äôve been using it about 18 months. It‚Äôs a nice way to track my monthly female cycle alongside temperature info. But the period part of the app isn‚Äôt arranged logically. No woman would have consented to this arrangement. Please hire more women and let them contribute.
1,smonsalve650,"I tried the ring but returned it.  The ring did not record my sleep and is uncomfortable.  Also, when the ring does record my heart rate, it shows my heart rate varies by 20 beats each subsequent beat but that is not the case. I just cannot trust this data now and it would be dangerous to act on faulty information.  If you think you have sleep issues, I would go to a real medical specialist, not this."
2,ChangingForce,I do love the ring but I do not love the app. I have had my ring for over a year and during that time I have had to completely delete the application at least 10 times and re-set up the ring each time because the app (even with regular updates) just continuously crashes and refuses to even open. Do better.
3,Sibe Copper,"This ring was fantastic up until two days ago when it no longer shows any of my stats, readiness scores or other metrics from overnight. They are there, I can see them on the cloud login portal on a computer, but it just shows empty and void of data in the app :("
4,Childish91,Like title says. Product is easy to wear and I like the battery. Main problem is it drastically over estimates activity by at least 100%. Whatever is your final calorie burn or steps take you should easily cut that in half if your using this to help diet.
1,Kmathers,"This ring was marketed saying it had active heart rate coming in ‚Äúearly‚Äù 2022. That‚Äôs the entire reason I purchased the ring. It‚Äôs May 2022 and still no update. Wrote to the company. First time no response from Oura. Second time, (same question), the rep had no answers citing ‚Äúearly 2022‚Äù again. Grammar errors in customer service email. Took weeks to get a response. It‚Äôs very bad practice to use trickery to lure customers and then not deliver on it!"
2,Bentley2417,"I have young kids, and they sometimes require me to get up late at night. Anytime I get up, the ring ends my night‚Äôs sleep, and starts a new sleep after that. It will only record the longer of the two, so it often thinks I got 3-4 hours of sleep. This renders all of the calculations useless, and it can‚Äôt be manually changed.   Very cool idea, looks great, and I WISH it worked, but had to return mine unfortunately."
1,covegirl07,"I will change my review when the app is updated to fix this problem. The oura app is supposed to have location services, however, the option does not appear in my iPhone app settings. I believe this is a developer bug. Location services are used for finding a lost Oura ring as well as the VO2 max walking test. My app and phone are both up to date."
4,Kerralex212,"I love the ring and the new interface however, I am having a weird bug with activity tracking. The location services is running in the background 24/7 which is eating into my battery life pretty substantially. iOS 18.2 beta 2."
5,Maywood Kid,The ring gives me very valuable information on my sleep patterns my heart rate my exercise in any number of things. I‚Äôm really enjoying the ring and I don‚Äôt think I could get by without it.
5,Bob 1440,"It‚Äôs more expensive, but so much better than my Fitbit at sleep tracking. The device isn‚Äôt really meant for detailed fitness tracking, but as a lifestyle and overall health tracker it is excellent."
5,Husto1,I have struggled to sleep for years. Tried everything. Oura allowed me to analyze my daily behavior and adjust to improve my sleep dramatically. I now get a solid 9 hours and feel so much better! Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it!
1,TheMachine822222,"I‚Äôve owned my Oura ring for about two years and loved it. Never had a problem. The last two weeks have been unbearable. The ring constantly stops working and connecting. Despite multiple tries to ‚Äúreset‚Äù the ring, Bluetooth, etc. it‚Äôs just no use. It periodically starts working again out of the blue but after this last time I think I‚Äôm finally done with it. Such a shame."
3,dina_g,"Decent sleep tracker. Graphs are inaccurate. Updates always break something. Sept 2023 it‚Äôs now suddenly recording all day as restorative time, including stairs, typing, walking.  Customer Service rarely reads what you write and send very frustrating cut-and paste answers. Wish they‚Äôd improve UI and QA and CS."
4,debbies32,"Love the ring & how it helps you to manage your health & athletic performance. I especially love the sleep. You always hear abt the types of sleep & this breaks it down. I only have 2 comments, the app doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äòreading in bed‚Äô & categorized it as latency when it‚Äôs not."
5,global hp,This is my 2nd ring and love it.  I writing here as my app won‚Äôt load 14 July 2022   For 3 day now . I have the latest software on iPhone 11 ‚Ä¶  I‚Äôve logged into my account and I can‚Äôt send a message to anyone for help.
5,Pattyg1234,I feel like the data the ring gives you is pretty accurate. I‚Äôve started paying attention a lot more to my sleep and being active.
4,LaurenK24,"The info gathered from the Oura ring is great. The layout of the app is fairly easy to navigate.   It would be great to be able to export data in bulk rather than day by day.   The period tracker needs work. It does a decent job of prediction but one should be able to add daily information about flow AND then see the data. Sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to look back at previous months to determine patterns. PLEASE add more features as the app and period tracker are updated.   The tags are getting better, but could be easier to access."
4,Roy mercer,"So far so good after one week. While the data provided is plentiful, the app needs simplifying. Too many dead ends. Too many clicks. It would be nice to show certain average metrics at a glance instead of requiring a click. Overall, UI/UX needs improvement. Other than that I love it!"
1,OuraRingCustomer,"Oura does not respond to problem reports. They sent a ring which does not charge. I filed a bug ticket, to which there has been no response - no exchange for a working ring, no shipping label to return the defective ring, nothing. They have no phone number, so you must use the app to report any problem and who knows if anyone reads these reports, since they do not respond. I‚Äôm apparently going to need to dispute the charge through my credit card company."
2,Totebote,"Always very hard to update. Need to delete and download. The worst: graph with sleep phases is hard to read; data granularity is rough; time divisions are in large chunks. Fitbit is far better. Allow user to set more accurate time measurements, even if this means shorter battery life. Finally, I think the new sleep algorithm  is incorrect. Believe Fitbit‚Äôs reflects better my and my wife‚Äôs observations."
3,Chasslyn,Every time this app is up for an update it continually gets stuck downloading!  It‚Äôs so frustrating.  Every other app will download/update and this one just sits stuck and I have to constantly try over and over and eventually restart my phone for it to work?
5,MissingNo3749,This has been helpful for tracking my sleep and even my period by tracking temperature. I‚Äôve worn it almost every night for over a year now!
4,Eajrobinson,"Since update two days ago, my sleep data is not loading and reporting. I‚Äôm getting a message to make sure my ring is on. My ring is on and fully charged. Today no sleep data."
1,Kristinm2,"Every time I try to open the app (which is daily) on my iPhone 14 Pro, the app crashes and I have to delete the app and reinstall it. I have to do this every morning and it's been going on this way for about a year. I contacted support repeatedly months ago and was told they are aware of it and are working on the problem. But it hasn't been fixed and  I'm still having to do this every morning."
4,Nana922,The app is very minimalist compared to other fitness apps out there however a widget feature for IOS would make the user experience 10x better to serve as a daily reminder of where your scores are at
5,Ptalk65,"I wear my Oura all the time. I use the detailed information to see how my body is reacting to the good and bad decisions I make regarding sleep, exercise and food/alcohol.   The sleep and HRV data provide the greatest insights for me as an active wellbeing consultant.   I love my Oura and recommend it to anyone seeking great info on their wellbeing."
3,Mei.Rain,I really wish the UI allowed me to rearrange the order of items to suit me better. It would also be nice to be able to tell the program that my typical daytime heart rate is higher than most so that it‚Äôs not constantly saying I must be stressed when I‚Äôm actually just going about my day.
1,Swimbugtoo,"Love the ring, but mine died after 6 months. Doesn‚Äôt hold a charge. Can‚Äôt reset it. Customer service in NON-EXISTANT!! 7 days and I‚Äôve heard nothing! And this is after a previous report I sent the week before (which was poorly answered and the issue is directly related to the first!) Save your $300 and buy a tracker that is supported. I am completely disappointed. If you can‚Äôt take care of your current customers, what are you doing selling MORE rings???"
1,Jadejskjdks,"The app design and functionality were amazing when I got my ring in August. Since the last big update, my ring never wants to connect and I‚Äôve had to delete the app multiple times. The new layout is also terrible - information is harder to find. I wish Oura would listen to the users. Feels like a waste of money solely because of this terribly designed app."
1,ddderek91,The new update makes this app much less intuitive.  We wear this for sleep and they got rid of the dedicated sleep button at the bottom. I used to be able to scroll through days at the top while looking at all my average and max HRV (or BPM). Now every time I switch days it jumps back to the top. Overall this new update took a massive step BACKWARDS. Debating on going to Whoop now. Please fix!
5,iholland95,This app has been my life since getting my ring back in April. I always try to beat my # steps of the previous day. This app has awesome features. Love that is tells so much about REM and deep sleep too! Very helpful!
5,Maddsc11,I got my Oura ring because I use natural cycles to track my cycle. Ours ring automatically sends over my body temperature which I love cause I don‚Äôt even have to think about it! The app is so easy to use with so much information.
5,debsky7799,"I absolutely love my Ring and the app.  It‚Äôs great being able see so much data about myself from how I sleep, my body temp and letting my know when it‚Äôs above normal.   There so much more info the ring/app provides."
3,Meghdolan,"It‚Äôs kind of crappy that you can‚Äôt add exercise from the day before. I‚Äôm out dancing and it‚Äôs 12:02 and it‚Äôs not letting me add the 2+ hours of heavy exercise I‚Äôve just done. Had some other buggy issues as well like when I flew 6 hours ahead and it completely jumped me an entire day, bot outherwise pretty solid app."
4,Angelofattack,I loved to read the Readiness and Sleep messages under my scores on the home page. Idk why the new update got rid of those :( I miss seeing those and being able to click the scores to get the gist of the insight.
2,Mathew Tallman,"Recent updates drag battery life down so badly, the ring does not survive a night if below 30% battery, but this level does not trigger a low battery notification so the ring dies before morning.   Gen2 ring was, all around, a far superior product. It did fewer things, but it did all of them better than this ongoing gen3 experiment."
1,Darvidd,"It would ‚Äùmake my experience even better‚Äù if this app would be updated properly to work with iOS 16. This is the second time the app has just stopped working for me - it would be one thing if I just bought the ring, but I‚Äôm paying a monthly fee for an app that isn‚Äôt working? Come on, guys. Get. It. Together. We want to like your product - don‚Äôt make it so easy to not like you."
5,ll900525,The app can‚Äôt sync and won‚Äôt respond while touch the screen after today‚Äôs update‚Ä¶ please fix that asap
1,RhythmicMoves,"So I bought one of these and like a complete idiot lost it the next day after taking it off at the gym. Well. Turns out they‚Äôre only willing to offer a replacement for $350. Which is a ridiculous cost for something that cannot cost more than $50 to make.   I‚Äôm sorry but as a fellow e-commerce owner, I‚Äôd this is the customer service you deliver, you deserve to fail.   I‚Äôm unimpressed and will be going back to whoop. What a joke."
2,kinky man from carona,"Been a daily user since 2021. I generally don‚Äôt have too many complaints, but recent updates have caused the device to NOT track activity well, if at all. Additionally, the functionality of the app has really went down hill with said updates. Numerous crashes when scrolling through parameters"
4,kayvirgo,I don‚Äôt understand why it asks about my sleeping schedule if it can‚Äôt use that info when it comes to my sleep habits. I work overnight for 12 hours from 6:45 to 7AM. Yet the app wants to tell me to head to bed around 10pm. Believe me. I wish I could. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
5,Sleazio,I love the ring but the real power is in the algorithms and ability to isolate and view variables over time and correlate them with others. One thing that‚Äôs needed is the ability to tell it your gonna take a nap. Biphasic sleeping is not the same as inactivity.
1,MC72GOLF,Not sure what you guys have done to your app but this is becoming a major issue. For a couple of months I had to delete it and reinstall it every now and again to get it to work without crashing but over the last month it really seems to become worse. A quick Google and you find loads of people with the same issue and on your own support page this has been an open issue for months.   It‚Äôs time to get the basic sorted before introducing more features! The app never had any of these issues thru out the Gen 1 or Gen 2 rings and tbh I really loved the simplicity of it. Now.. you have gone from a 5 star solution to a 1.   Sort the basics !!
2,poor app. fix it,"I have to search around the app to find daily data. There should be one simple dashboard that gives you everything that you need on one click. Take a look at the Fit Bit dashboard, it‚Äôs much better.   Also should be able to set my own goals and not be tied to ones Oura decides is right for men   Your product is excellent. Improve your app interface, it‚Äôs very poor"
5,KHB2554,"Great form factor, great observability, metrics and graphics of your sleep, readiness, resilience. Monitor a wide array of your personal health metrics and level of activity. Active personal trainer that sits quietly and unobtrusively on your finger.   Been actively using for ~ 18 months. Love this product!!!"
1,Sbeve Jah,"I don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs a new ring, we should not have to re sync our ring almost ever, if it were months I‚Äôd care less but this experience has only started happening on recent versions and requires me to resync every major two or three updates, even if someone‚Äôs on the BETA I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right. This is a bad bad bug. You‚Äôll likely see a response saying it‚Äôs my system, untrue."
3,ChrissyDee630,"Usually love it but the most recent update just makes the app crash while trying to open it. I can‚Äôt access my info and can‚Äôt tell if my data is being tracked anymore. Generally speaking before this, overall it‚Äôs good but doesn‚Äôt always pick up on naps or workouts."
1,Mikitamikado,"I used Oura for a few years, was an early adopter of the product. Unfortunately I lost my gen2 ring, so I purchased a new one.  I was beyond disappointed to learn that they now Require a subscription on top of already expensive ring in order to truly track the sleep. The ring is useless really without the subscription. To me this feels like a bait and switch and I will be looking for an alternative."
1,JazzLover4Life,"I had a 2nd generation ring and was happy with it. The 3rd gen came out with an offer for ‚Äúfree lifetime membership,‚Äù so I purchased it. 6 months after spending $350 on the ring, they cancel my membership and require me to start paying a monthly fee to use continue to use it. I‚Äôve contacted customer service several times, and have been ignored every time.  I strongly recommend avoiding this company."
1,Dkracerfl,Their customer service is literally a black hole of incompetence. Even wrote an email to their CEO begging for help‚Ä¶ nothing. Not worth the price to be left on your own when a problem arises. It‚Äôs not just that their service is non responsive (they are terribly non responsive) but the worst part is when you do get a response you can count on it being completely wrong. Don‚Äôt waste your money
5,MountainKidd,I love how it tracks all sleep related metrics automatically and I can view the charts on the web. My only gripe is that there is no way to fix the occasional errors that show up manually.
5,Valto_,One of the first things what I do when I wake up is to check my data from Oura. No need to be charging battery all the time. Looking forward to what their future versions will be adding.
5,elle lloyd,"Love this ring, tracking my sleep and seeing all the variables has helped change my health in amazing ways. Sleeping 7-8 hours every night possible.  My only request is being able to add exercise the next day. Be well."
5,JonathanFromBoston,"Really enjoy the new app update which provides a clean dashboard that was previously clunky.  One thing I would like to see in the future, should Oura-UCSF survey continue, is to keep the survey within the app and not go into Safari."
5,SPro151989,"From cycle tracking thats integrated to my natural cycles app, to sleep, stress and activity it‚Äôs so accurate and so good! It has predicted every part of my cycle so accurate to the day, it‚Äôs wild."
1,DeafLeopard77,As someome who has PCOS and PMDD trying to see if the cycle tracking work it does not. It incrrectly predicts your period you also have to pay ADDITIONAL for the Natural Cycles App and the graph and user interface design is so misleadijg and confusing as the graph makes zero sense on whether progesterone or estrogen is up or down. It has left me hopeless in trying to manage my period symptoms as having hormonal imbalance is not a way to live.
5,Aknot Wot,"After complaining for a few months that the app would ignore sleep in case I would be awake for 30 min or more during the night, they finally fixed it. Thank you for listening, it's working great now!"
3,Kacey gone,I am not loving the updated user interface design. There are too many clicks to navigate and too much information. It was so much simpler before. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking at now or the fastest way to get to what I am looking for.  Debating canceling my subscription.
1,Ian19790,"Battery only last 6 months. I got a new replacement ring from oura, and the same thing happened after another 3 months. Replaced it again, and it just died after one day. Switched to Whoop last week as I‚Äôm done with the battery issues once and for all. Product was great when it worked, but battery issues led me to leave Oura for their competitor."
2,dg1409999@,"Every time I open this app I feel like I am missing something‚Ä¶ I have been unable to make any meaningful changes based on the data I am getting. The layout of the app is not intuitive to me but the overall nail in the coffin is how slow everything seems to take, loading, syncing with natural cycles, app updates."
4,anches,"I‚Äôd happily give Oura ring 5 stars. It‚Äôs an excellent device that I have come to rely on tremendously. However, the app is unstable and requires me to delete and reinstall every week to 10 days. It‚Äôs a time consuming process and it really sours my experience. Hey Oura fix your app!"
3,LeanneSF,"So many features are extremely frustrating. It doesn‚Äôt record awake times in the evening, but there no way to add them. It has an ‚Äòadd activity‚Äù feature that doesn‚Äôt actually let you add an activity. Some of the data is interesting."
3,Kinnectman,"Cannot update to the latest version because of subscription model. Hope they let us buy new version without subscription.  Second, I noticed their HRV readings are very different from heartmath.. which I feel have better accuracy."
1,breksor$65490&,"I have really enjoyed my Oura ring until about a month ago when the App started crashing every time I tried to open it. I‚Äôve tried numerous times to delete it, but it isn‚Äôt possible. You are only able to remove the app from the Home Screen. So now I have an expensive ring that is worthless without the app. Please get some experts on board to get this fixed!"
5,Bare trouble,Omg! I love my ring. It has helped me lose weight because I monitor my activity. My sleep is better. I love that when I am inactive for too long it alerts me to ‚Äústretch my legs.‚Äù Waiting for the O2 levels at the end of summer.
2,AdventureCoconut,The new layout is horrible and isn‚Äôt as easy to navigate as the one I‚Äôve know for the past 2 years. It‚Äôs frustrating. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even show me my sleep score and I have to scroll around to find my sleep data.   Ive been happy with the app until recently.
1,mayam1295,"The new app UI is extremely difficult to navigate. It‚Äôs less intuitive, and I don‚Äôt see the information and graphs that matter to me immediately. I hate that I have to click through by several buttons to find graphs that‚Äôs used to be on the home page!   I honestly find myself checking the app and stats less than I did before the update."
4,Hrfjyfjhdbnj,"Should add period sync from health and adding tags in the future or untimed. This was a gift, otherwise my apple watch does pretty much the same thing plus a lot more. It does track naps which the watch doesn‚Äôt, and tracks walks authomatically."
1,Pavel Kolenda,"Oura sells you a product for a lot of $$$, offers 30 days return policy, but gives away 6 months of ‚Äúfull functionality‚Äù of a product. After 6 months, they shut off all benefits of the product and require a subscription.   Make a pick: you charge a subscription and give me the product it you sell me the product and let me use it. Can‚Äôt have both. ABSOLUTELY REGRET BUYING THEIR RING."
4,scott davies,"The five star rating is fair. I‚Äôm rating 4 stars because my ring no longer alerts me to charge when the battery is low.   The sleep debt description is remarkably in line with how I felt, would like to see more stats around it."
5,MTBSPrinter,I‚Äôve used my Oura ring for 3 years. Perfect for regular wear and tracking fitness. I like the quality feedback tools in the app. Practical and useful for tracking sleep too.
4,RandomJRM,Generally I‚Äôve found the Oura Ring to add a lot of value to my well-being. But honestly the unguided meditation feature is becoming more buggy and unreliable as time goes on. Would really love some attention put on this.
3,stjean family,"The app and Oura ring have amazing data collection and insights. The one flaw that would be an easy fix I know multiple people have asked for is to allow more data points to be synced with Apple health. The ring collects steps but this isn‚Äôt synced with health which is an annoyance for us Apple health users. Oura, please add this in!"
1,OOOPPP21,The app keeps crashing. I have reached out to customer service their recommendation was to delete and reinstall. The problem kept happening and they keep coming back saying i have to delete and reinstall again for more than 4 times now. Its sad because the product is amazing but the experience with customer service is terrible.
1,wishmyouraworkedJen,"I have been wearing the Oura 3 for about 3 weeks now and it gives me credit for thousands of more steps than I am taking. I‚Äôve worn it on my dominant hand, non dominant hand and even have it on my thumb now. Literally one day I was in the car for 8 hours and did no exercise and my Oura said I walked 10,000 steps.  My watch is so much more accurate so I trust it for my steps count. I hope the Oura updates can correct this."
2,pj_harvey whinesteen,"I‚Äôve been enjoying my Oura Ring for the last two years, but after the recent update my battery life is terrible. I have to charge the ring much more frequently and it seems to drop from full charge to below 50% rapidly. I‚Äôve missed collecting sleep data on several occasions due to this over the past week or so."
3,Eric-C.,"I get great information and insight around sleep patterns and readiness but had hoped for calorie counts on my workouts. But the activity monitoring relies on the accelerometer, fine for walking or running but blotto for static resistance exercise including my vigorous hot yoga practice. I can log activities but the canned calorie counts are way low; not getting good activity tracking at all."
3,BrigitteBrett,"My actual ring rating was 5 for the last few years but since they‚Äôve changed the app, I think it‚Äôs confusing and harder to navigate.  I‚Äôve loved the ring until the app made no sense"
1,Big_Red21,"After the app update yesterday, I can no longer connect my ring to the app.  I‚Äôve tried all the recommended troubleshooting options to no avail.  I decided to cancel my subscription bc I‚Äôm tired of fighting with it when I pay monthly for an app.  Kind of ridiculous after the price of the ring to then need a subscription to an app that doesn‚Äôt work great."
5,Sean Hickman,This product and app are extremely intuitive. It provides me with all the information that I need and more. It lets me know my superpower status on the daily.
2,Bikes rule,"I lost mine in a 20 minute window one day and no way to find it in the next 4 days within a 300 foot radius. Had to cancel. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs gone after 6 months only! Nice enough app. Just don‚Äôt lose the ring, as the Find My Ring feature is merely the last location the ring connected to your phone location."
1,Piyrate,"Used this product for over 3 years and lost my ring. The new one sets you back decades in terms of functionality unless you pay for subscription. Not worth it anymore, the sum total functionality is only worth it if you do not own any other fitness device like an Apple Watch. If you do, this is absolutely useless from its subscription price point."
3,dgwilcox,"I‚Äôve had a 3rd gen ring for almost a year now. And I‚Äôm pretty happy with it‚Ä¶ but the software does have its idiosyncrasies.  1. In North America, ever since the time change to Daylight Savings happened last spring the the Sleep Cycle graph is always one hour off. I‚Äôve sent (more than) a few support requests, but eight months later‚Ä¶ nothing. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens when we go back to Standard Time.  2. iOS 17 widgets are inoperable.   3. And just recently, syncing to my Strava data is inconsistent. Also sent in a support ticket on that issue."
5,eno966,"I‚Äôve been an Oura ring user for close to two years now and rely heavily on the metrics the ring provides, especially as it pertains to sleep. The new features such as  rest time and mindfulness add more robust offerings. Love my Oura ring. Thank you for such a great product"
5,itfckenwimdy,I am having an absolutely wonderful time using my oura ring but I do wish I could add a custom tag or two. I'd love to be able to tag my medical symptoms (IE seizures) that aren't already in the app
3,Hdhcibdic,"I love the ring and the app, but having the detail icons on the top of the phone is less convenient. The summary report on tab 2 is also not digestible as the charts you get by diving in. It takes longer for me to get to the data I care about."
2,QueenMab@99,"I don‚Äôt have this issue with any other iOS app, but for some reason with Oura you start the update and it just hangs for days before finishing. It‚Äôs super frustrating, particularly when new features or fixes are in the update and you can‚Äôt be sure when you‚Äôll get them."
1,NYC+30,"If you don‚Äôt pay them each month, they still collect your data but only show you 3 values without any explanations. This is so bad.  They should at last show all details and suggestions, as they claim but no historical data. As they claim.  So they lie because they show you nothing useful while they also steal your data.  This is so bad business practice."
5,Sleep days 12,I was excited to get a ring and was really wanting to tract my sleeping pattern but I work nights and it seems to not track it properly.  Is there a way to set a time for sleep ?
5,mariebks,"Used to repeatedly crash every so often and I‚Äôd have to uninstall and reinstall, but has been stable for the past few months."
5,*NursieJ*,"Spend the $, it is so worth it. So much insight, great customer service and I never even know it‚Äôs there. I hated sleeping with my watch on, so this is great. Lots of updates too to keep it great. Just buy it!"
5,A.Amini,This ring is great. Both my wife and I use it. Best part is the customer service. True professionals and they‚Äôll go out of their way to make everything right.
5,MorpheusVoice,Love this app.  Usually I‚Äôm disappointed with these kinds of app.  This one works great with my Oura ring. I‚Äôm very pleased with both the ring and app.
3,Axumite,"Issues with the ring which cannot be resolved using the self-serve FAQ ‚Äúhelp‚Äù section mean if you don‚Äôt get your ring working in 100% fashion, your attempts to contact/email Customer Support for assistance are futile. No response at all besides the customary ‚Äúwe‚Äôve received your inquiry‚Äù boilerplate. V. Disappointing."
1,Bulle72,"I had the old Oura ring and recently purchased the new version. It is an expensive item, but I was infuriated that I had to pay an additional ¬£50 of vat and duties (after purchasing the item in ¬£ on their website for an already expensive item) definitely not worth it. You are better off buying an Apple Watch for less."
4,Glucose Doc,Have it for a week.  I really like it so far.  I WISH that they would add an ad-hoc HR and T feature on the iPhone.  Example: I don‚Äôt care about this at work but I‚Äôd love to have the iPhone shout out my HR and T every 5 minutes during an exercise.
1,AerialDre.com,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.   I repeat. do NOT buy this product.   I initially was really happy about it.   3 months later. The ring and app stopped working all together. Now I‚Äôm stuck here googling how to exchange it or get my money back.   I might continue spreading the word on other platforms to prevent another causality or victim.  This also comes as a result of POOR customer service. Just look up other people‚Äôs dilemmas with this product and you will find similar issues.  I rarely write negative reviews. If at all.   I will wait and see if Oura will decide to reach out and do something about it instead of promote and dump upset customer dollars into marketing a higher priced ring....  Seriously so upset about this.
1,XVirtualBlessings,"I am extremely frustrated with the frequent inability to connect my ring to my iPhone 16, despite following all the steps outlined in the help section. It has been nearly two days of failed attempts to connect. The Oura 4 ring is far too expensive to have these issues. I have only had the ring for a few weeks, and this is unacceptable."
3,Jbsjbsjbs,"It used to be that when I manually entered a workout, it would override any workouts detected by the ring that occurred at same time. Now the automatically detected workouts don‚Äôt get deleted and I have to go in and delete the manually. This is kind of annoying."
1,Mloneill,I cannot be the app to open so it‚Äôs impossible to sync my data since this update came out. My iOS is up to date so that can‚Äôt be the reason. I‚Äôve successfully opened the app 1 time since this version released and I had to power down then power back on to accomplish that. Any chance they‚Äôll be a patch to fix that bug soon?
3,kpdixon79,"The app used to work, now it just crashes. Won‚Äôt even load up the app. I still wear the ring cos it looks cool, but it‚Äôs all for show until they get the app working again  Edit: seems to have been fixed by deleting the app then re-installing."
3,Narmur19,"Having an issue with the widgets where they stop showing information until I restart the phone. Additionally, workout HR have occasionally not synced properly and the data hasn‚Äôt been logged after recording"
3,sbf129,Never had a problem until I installed 16.0. Now the app won't open.  I'm constantly going through the process of uninstalling the app and reinstalling.  Each time I reinstall I have to go through the set up process from scratch. Very irritating
4,Ramonatv,"Hi- I cannot get any answers from Oura customer care but my app crashes weekly on my iPhone 13pro max and I have to delete the app and reinstall it, losing my sleep data. It‚Äôs BEYOND frustrating and I am hoping the developer can help me!"
3,Fstgrl,I loved the Oura ring until they decided to become a subscription service. This is one of the many reasons I got rid of my whoop. Why would I want a product that costs more over time. Bad move Oura.  You‚Äôve ruined a great product for me.
2,Body temp,I received feedback on my body temperature and could not find any data to support this in the app. I looked for help via Finn chat and the chat would never load; it just showed a circle loading process. I was then frustrated to find any help for my query on where to view body temperatures.
1,Honest Answers Only,"I waited months to get the ring. When I finally received it, it wouldn‚Äôt work! It will not connect to my app. The ring will not charge. There is little to no customer service. You have to wait a week for an unhelpful email. Such a bad experience and hassle and waste of time. I heard good things about Oura once but, that doesn‚Äôt match my experience. What a let down‚Ä¶ Oura do better."
1,ColinFON,"Greed greed greed.  Found this company searching for an item without monthly fees.   Buy the ring - month later learn ring is obsolete.  Asked to spend another $200 to get Gen3.  The only extended feature of guided meditation removed and taken to Gen3.  Already convinced a few people not to buy ≈åura and wait to see what their competitors coming to market will do (Motiv, Circular).  They came for my wallet now I‚Äôm coming for theirs."
1,Lionlera,I bought my Oura ring but sadly it get disconnected all the time. Every time I want to check my stress level or whatever the app says that I have to connect a ring and it been all day charging and it doesn‚Äôt work when I need it.  When I‚Äôm working hard and I want to see how many calories I‚Äôve burnt again is disconnected as usual.
1,iva19688,"I‚Äôve been a use of the ours ring for years now.  Generally really like the product. However, recently, a few month now , the app has become unusable. It freezes every time I open it and needs restarting several times to log any workout.  I am on the latest IOS and iPhone 16. I hope this gets the company‚Äôs attention."
5,BL 888,App provides a lot of information based on the data collected by the ring. Looking forward to more features and data.
5,Rex from Texas,"I have been using my Oura ring for over 8 months. The details about my resting heart rate, body temperature, sleep levels and suggested causes and solutions to negative effects on my sleep are very useful. I love this technology!!"
3,nick10492763,App can‚Äôt be trusted to always work. Right now it isn‚Äôt tracking naps at all. I have complained about this once but they never fixed the problem. App takes a long time to update information when you open it.
4,mywordscreate,"I've loved using the oura ring for the last three years but today, July 2nd, 2022, the app keeps crashing every time I try to open it. Please address. Thank you!"
4,Gracie's 2nd mom,"I often lie down in the afternoon as a short nap. Often it shows that I went to bed at 1:54 then asks why the gaps when I don‚Äôt get up until 5am. The gaps are dinner and walking the dog, removing makeup and brushing my teeth not gaps! Can‚Äôt we fix that? I love it otherwise."
1,jed013,"Although I liked my Oura ring when I had it, the company offered to upgrade my ring for free and arranged for me to send in my old ring. They NEVER sent me the replacement ring, so essentially they stole my ring from me. I have sent numerous messages and emails but have not received one response. There is no telephone number available. I feel like I have no recourse. TERRIBLE customer service."
5,fubarnia,"Focus on rest and recovery is great, rather than a focus on physical performance. It still tracks activity well enough, but it‚Äôs not the central thing.  It‚Äôs accurate, helpful, and mellow."
2,daeckerson,Love the ring and the potential it has.  I am not impressed with the minimal information  that comes with the monthly fee.  The current amount of information provided with the fee should be free and the monthly fee should be providing much more information.
2,Jokentay0000000,"Love the ring, app needs some help!  I am not notified consistently regarding my battery status and often lose ability to track things like sleep/activity due to lack of notification. Reached out to support team with no help, would really enjoy this being fixed!"
5,Djlion2,The most accurate and comfortable way to collect and track your sleep data. The insights have been profound and allows me to consciously try new things to better my sleep.
4,Banjoxenia,Have tried since it came out. All other app updates install but not Oura. Don‚Äôt dare to delete app to try it that way in case it still doesn‚Äôt install.
3,WA4GNI,"Recommended work-arounds fail.  Sketchy, vague, customer support.  This product is not worthy of the App Store and seriously needs to be quality checked for Apple standards.  Do not buy this product until they fix these basic issues."
3,lucywho,"It would be really great if the ring synced to Health app. The only data it shares to health app is mindful minutes. If I use the record HR feature In Oura, health app doesn‚Äôt recognize it but if you record an activity in Health app, Oura tracks. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why one way and not the other."
1,Gadraw,"Activities is never counted accurately. If you have imported an activity it will be counted, but as soon as you exit the app and go back into the app, that activity imported from Apple Watch will disappear. Now with the latest app update the readiness score, sleep score for the current day is gone. What the heck is the point of this? $400 worth of junk."
5,It‚Äôs Dave!,"I‚Äôve been sleep tracking for 10 years and was CTO of a wrist band health tracker company. The Oura Ring is the most elegant, informative app I‚Äôve found. I have meaningfully improved my deep sleep with it. Way less work than wrist bands!"
1,Facie,"I have loved this app and my oura ring since I purchased about 9 months ago. However, over the last week it‚Äôs been useless. First it just wasn‚Äôt syncing my data, then it wasn‚Äôt able to locate my ring. I tried all the suggested trouble shooting and I‚Äôm currently logged out - able to detect the ring but cannot pair/sync. Beyond frustrating!"
4,Graceüíò,"I love my ring and the app! BUT I am so unhappy about the monthly payment. I paid over $600 for this ring. That is a massive investment, I do not want to pay even more $ every single month."
4,ANApple1,"I tried deleting and reinstalling, restarting the phone, but it does not work, and they are a very useful function. Other than that everything‚Äôs great. Possibly the best fitness tracker ever. Please fix."
4,As4ronin,"What‚Äôs up Oura? Suddenly the app crashes every time I attempt to open it, even after the new update.. currently not working so hope you push a fix soon.."
1,Foxness,"I've enjoyed my ring and was using it as my main health tracker, however now the app won't even open! Right as my free 6 months with the purchase of the ring and 2 bonus months came up too- its not a bonus month if i can't use it at all. I won't be paying for an app subscription if it's this unreliable. I also wear a Garmin tracker watch that is more stable."
5,GMGByTheSea,"I have tinkered with almost every aspect of my life to optimize my sleep. It is small and unobtrusive, prefer to wear a ring over a watch. App is great and informative."
2,slavagnino,"In the last couple of versions, the iOS app has a prompt to ‚Äúupdate your health data‚Äù.  No matter how often I say ‚Äúallow access‚Äù it keeps showing the prompt. Whatever my choices are, you should honor them and stop nagging about it!"
1,bxjentksh,"I can‚Äôt even access my data because the app crashes every single time I try to open it, even after deleting and reinstalling. $400 for absolutely nothing until they figure out the app. It is incredibly frustrating it is an issue when so many users have the same problem."
1,tjmiller1,The app has been fantastic up until last week when there was an update. Now it won‚Äôt load on my phone and crashes whenever I click on the icon. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go back to working in a month or less but it‚Äôs frustrating to not be able to use the app when I paid for the ring
1,Alsojeff,"Received for Christmas and still does not do half of what was (and curiously is still) advertised. Not an ethical company. Customer service response delayed months if ever. The ring did tell me 3 days after I got sick that I was getting sick‚Ä¶ better late than never?  I was a huge fan of gen 2, and have become hugely disappointed by gen 3. Don‚Äôt bother with Oura. Whoop strap is a cheaper and superior product."
3,mcrham,"Good hardware and software, however in app marketing to upsell and not allowing you to opt out is amateurish,  add in what feels like app updates every week and they have gone way down hill.  A year ago I would have said 5 stars, today I struggled to give them 3."
3,LA Fashionista 1,"Doesn‚Äôt accurately understand my sleep as much, thinks I‚Äôm still asleep when I wake up but stay in bed, and vise versa, thinks I‚Äôm asleep right when I lay down but not when I actually fall asleep. Also doesn‚Äôt pick up on my naps anymore."
3,Ytzdzdhdude,Generally I love this app and it‚Äôs super useful as a fitness tracker. But it crashes as soon as I open it now. If this gets fixed I‚Äôll change this review back to a five star  Edit‚Äî  More stable now but I had to delete and re-download many times
5,K2_64,"I love the Oura ring - it has given me a lot of insight. Please add compatibility with apps like 10% Happier, so that when doing meditation or other workouts using different apps those metrics can be included. Than you!"
5,R&R4Health,"I got the OURA ring to help with sleep, which it has done mightily. It has also taught me a ton about many things that are related to & reflect over all health, how to establish it, & how to maintain it. A great tool to have."
5,59 and gray,I used to guess how my sleep was going and tended to be on the negative side. Now I am fully informed and it really gives me confidence that when I score well I feel well. I love the advise it gives me when I score good or bad!!!
5,Lab jambs,Love the oura ring and all its features. However I Just updated the app and it keeps closing unexpectedly and the ring stopped recording metrics. Please fix üôèüèΩ
4,jays biggest fanüíï,"I have to say I was pretty dissatisfied with the inaccuracy in activity tracking. However, I just updated the app, and my workouts are now being recorded pretty accurately. Thanks for fixing that!"
3,Therkyn,The app features are fine. The new layout is not intuitive and getting my sleep info now takes like 3 paths to get there. Change for change sake is not positive. Simplify the interface. Don‚Äôt complicate it.
2,Correyo,"The ring continuously misses major movement and exercise that I do, it doesn‚Äôt catch when I‚Äôm having a panic attack (happened twice), and the charging system keeps breaking.   The concept is very cool but the data you‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt necessarily accurate. It just makes you feel good."
4,Haristotle,"Didn‚Äôt work from beginning. Running 16.0.2 now and it is still not working. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled. C‚Äômon devs!  Update: it‚Äôs working on 16.2 fine, idk what was wrong but it‚Äôs been fixed, apparently."
5,ScagBaron,I‚Äôve had my Oura 3 for a week and I love it!  It is intuitive and requires very little effort. It is learning quickly. Oura is a great product and a great company. The customer service is the best!
3,alnurchique,"Oura is absolutely amazing but lately the app would be randomly crashing after some period of time. The problem is, to fix this error I have to reinstall the app every time and connect my ring again. Please fix it."
4,Misha1968,"Hi.  The steps/mile calculation on your app is way off. Considers average step over 5 ft.  Please fix your formula.   Overall a good idea for an app to help people understand their sleeping patterns and issues, but the product is still in it‚Äôs infancy. Hopefully they will be adding more capabilities and functions.   Latency calculations/assumptions are usually wrong. Since the app does not actually know when a person goes to bed, may be there should be a feature to let the app know manually."
2,LadyWarrior3,I love the ring but not the app.  The notification settings are on to alert me for all the extra stuff I need to do keep moving and get my steps in but it never alerts me until I actually open the app.  It‚Äôs so weird.  Wish they would enhance it.  App definitely needs some major work.
5,generalp2,"I am on my second version of the Oura ring and they just keep getting better and better. Very helpful to know how my health is, especially the heart rate, heart patterns, and respiratory rates."
5,Pbuggs,"What gets measured gets managed. I‚Äôve consistently gotten better sleep after starting to use Oura. I recommend it to anyone who wants to feel more energized, more consistently."
4,Tabs1984MO,I love my Oura ring and feel the data is very accurate but they keep changing the layout of the app categories and it‚Äôs not an well laid out and intuitive as it used to be.
3,Adash23,I really think this update is a step backwards. I use the Oura ring for sleep analysis & analytics - and until the gen 5 when there‚Äôs more (hopefully) activity tracking - that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in the app.
3,JLDMert,"I love my ring for the sleep feature, however it is not tracking my cycle. It says my period has not been logged, but it has. When I click on the calendar the droplets are there. I‚Äôm unsure how to troubleshoot this."
3,BrZe0,"The subscription pricing isn't justified given the mediocre data quality, which can be hard to read and navigate through. While the UI is somewhat visually appealing, the UX falls short. In comparison, Apple's health app offers a superior experience."
1,runingma,Once you purchase this expensive product you have to pay a monthly fee to keep it active. Don‚Äôt do it. If you have a watch or other tracking system you get the same information. I‚Äôve had it for a month. Very limited value. Will not be paying for the monthly fee. If anyone wants one I‚Äôve got one for sale!
2,_IHaveSpoken_,This product is useless without the subscription. So disappointed that there is no telemetry. Not even the base scores worked for me when my subscription expired. Folks should know in big bold letters that you only get 6 months of utility for a multi hundred dollar product investment.
3,Emi 85,"On my iPhone the period tracking app has very poor formatting of the text, both in the button and outside. Consider fixing this ASAP as it really affects the readability and user experience"
1,headless,"I had an Oura 2 and after a year, the battery lasted one day.  Of course, it was out of warranty for a short period of time.  I went ahead and got the Oura 3 and loved the 5 day battery‚Ä¶.several months in, now it‚Äôs getting 3 days.  I wish this company could actually make a product that would hold battery charge.  It‚Äôs really frustrating."
5,BobbyO17,By far the most accurate and advanced in sleep tracking and quantitative data. Helps me know when I can push my workouts and what tactics are working the best for me to get good sleep! A non-negociable.
1,cdriscoll123,Had my ring for less than a year - the battery charge started falling off after about 7 months - contacted the help/service team and they said ‚Äúsorry how about an extra month of subscription‚Äù - very expensive product to have it last less than 12 months.
2,Irishtoon,"Over night, the app is running in the background constantly (I.e. no screen time and 100% of activity on phone) and I believe is part of the current battery drain issue that upgraded and new iPhone 14 users are dealing with. Please let me know if this is normal and designed behavior?"
1,Carlito86,"The ring itself and the app (when it works) is great. However, the fact that Oura now charges a subscription to access the basic functionality of the ring (which is a change with Gen 3), it is UNACCEPTABLE to have an app that absolutely will not open. I‚Äôm now paying more for an app that works less."
1,Phil@lifetime,After a year of use the ring doesn‚Äôt stay charged for more than a day and you will lose a nights worth of data. The new ring now wants a monthly subscription which makes the Apple Watch much more economical with more features and data.  Update:  The app constantly crashes and support is lacking.
1,N-735-A,"The membership is about $6 per month, when you want to cancel it. The only way is contact the customer service, but They use lots of tricks to stop you, at the end, they sent you a delete link. But it doesn‚Äôt work at all. Now you know you will submit the membership fee for ever!"
1,Steel6,The latest update is at least the third time that after completing the app crashes on start with the only fix being deletion and reinstall of the app and reconnection of the ring which requires the dock. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt carry my dock with me so no data available until I am done traveling. Poor. Very poor.
1,abogadoavocado,"The most recent update requires a ‚Äúdata sync‚Äù before you can continue using the app. But the data sync won‚Äôt complete, even after restarting my phone. From reddit reviews, looks like this is a common problem. Releasing an app update with this bug is unacceptable. Until this is fixed, I just have an expensive, useless ring."
1,Auon Hamadani,This is my 3rd Oura ring and this is the latest (Oura ring 4). I have tried everything mentioned on the website for troubleshooting but the ring still won‚Äôt connect. I have an iPhone 16 Pro and updated to the latest OS. I have NOT heard anything from any representative from Oura despite sending multiple emails. I was hoping more professionalism from them!
1,Nods tear,"The new app interface release is SO terrible! What on earth were the team trying to optimize for? It is not intuitive, takes too many steps to do any job! I‚Äôm so disappointed. I‚Äôve been an Oura user since 2021 and was about to upgrade to the new ring again! I won‚Äôt now. So disappointing. Please please revert and fix this!!"
5,Sandyhub1,"I love my ring! In fact, when I get up in the morning, it‚Äôs the first thing I look at once I‚Äôve gotten my first cup of coffee! It is so good to know how my sleep went."
5,FedUpWithFBcrap8343,Can we please get to share step counts in circles. This is one of the best ways to encourage other members to compete and log daily steps.
5,Tauvelt,"I never would have purchased an Apple Watch if this had been around. So many helpful insights into my health and how to improve things! Love, love, love it!!"
3,Hemera_,I really love my ring and think it helps me stay active. However when I‚Äôm crocheting it counts it as steps so I just have to take my ring off I guess. Plus you should add steps in circles so you can see how many your friends have taken.
1,62kkimbo,"Customer Service is non existent‚Ä¶ pitfalls:  1. Unable to use web site unless a credit card is entered day one, this was gift ‚Ä¶ unable to enter proper info from day one, locked out of web site.  2. Emails to customer service go unanswered- 3. Now that my free trial is over very limited info on phone displays in addition, in order to see the free info ‚Ä¶ I am asked to sync my ring, every day? Come on! 4. Not sure how accurate sleep monitor is? Ie rem and deep?  5. Battery duration is poor at best ‚Ä¶ requires charge every 3 days. Between the syncing and charging makes my Fitbit look like a dream product! Love my Fitbit!"
4,The real truth about apps,The ring looks really good I am happy with how it feels. The app seems to be easy to use. I think it would be really great if a Widget was incorporated onto the home screen for easy access and checking.
1,NoGoodnannmemdm,"My old style ring that I have had for 2 years no longer holds a charge - even on airplane mode - since the latest update this week. For 3 mornings in a row, went to bed with decent charge and woke up drained. Fully charged ring last night and same thing happened this morning. Very disappointing."
5,Healthyaging,"I have learned so much about my sleep patterns and heart rate variability. With the tracking data from the Oura ring, I have been able to make much needed improvements in my sleep and exercise."
1,ec1030,"The Oura ring used to be excellent; however, the quality has gone downhill in an apparent attempt to get people to, ‚Äúupgrade.‚Äù The daily info is completely inaccurate. The ring registers wrong bed time, nap time,  wake up times, as well as physical activity. Definitely not buying the new version, and getting rid of the old ring."
4,Mick2009,"Provides lots of data. One con is that no matter how much activity, walks, jogs, etc. it constantly shows that I am inactive. Additionally, I have received alerts, yet the app says zero (0) alerts. I‚Äôd give it 5 stars otherwise. Very interesting and informative."
2,SailinShoes,"This is normally a great app, which provides some really nice insights into how I can improve my sleep and health habits. But lately, the app‚Äôs battery usage is significant, despite most of it being used in the background.  I hope they can fix the issues in a future release!"
1,DaltonMyas,"As an Oura Ring user, I was disappointed by the company's recent app update, which limits access to sleep and readiness scores without a subscription. This means that users who have already invested in the device cannot access essential information without paying extra fees. Company is a total scam and keep getting worse."
1,Suerte Matt,"New, untested product with a one year warranty? Gen3 ring completely failed at 14 months and all they offer is a $50 discount on another $300 ring? It‚Äôs not even the best wearable on the market. It‚Äôs just smaller and it‚Äôs ‚Äògood enough‚Äô. Don‚Äôt waste your money on Oura until they figure out their hardware issues and app rollout delays and product lifespan."
1,Babelfish80,"App crashes every time it updates. Has to be uninstalled/reinstalled and re-paired with my ring. This is super inconvenient, especially right now since I‚Äôm on vacation! I legit just did this 3 days ago and now I have to do it again! I love my ring, but please stop causing my app to crash!  Still happens months later. PLEASE fix this!!!"
1,Jacqueline Boyce,"I do love the ring‚Ä¶ but I feel it‚Äôs a little false advertising‚Ä¶. I thought this would give me insights on my cycle. It says to follow through trends. Which, what I‚Äôm gathering is I have to follow my heart rate‚Ä¶ I have used better cycle tracking systems and I‚Äôm bummed cause that was really the only reason I purchased the ring. Hopefully they will make it easier"
5,KieranSingh,I pre ordered the second gen ring so I‚Äôve had the ring for a while now. The app was originally pretty good but keeps getting better with every update!
2,L9000155,"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed, buyer beware. Based on the marketing I had expected that absolute body temperature would be reported and that that data would get written to Apple Health. Instead, only relative fluctuations in temperature are recorded and nothing surrounding your temperature is written to Health. Super disappointed guys"
2,NaMaFig,"I‚Äôm not sure if the app is buggy, but four days ago I updated the app and to my disappointment, it doesn‚Äôt reflect the new update in the app. It looks exactly the same, no new tabs nor the new app layout. Please put another update that will actually work >:("
2,MayaS94,If you buy the ring and don‚Äôt plan on paying the monthly fee it‚Äôs basically worthless. There is no info other than your scores which is pretty bare features for a $300 ring. Really regret buying this now that it‚Äôs $7/month on top of my initial purchase. Apple Watch>
1,Amy2697,They required me after 5 months of having the ring to update to a ‚Äúnew model‚Äù with all these ‚Äúimproved features‚Äù only to now over 6 months later and you still don‚Äôt have the features.  Total rip off. CEO fired. Horrible customer service. Fail fail fail for Oura
5,KRob-1,"I‚Äôve been a user for 3 years now, the ring is solid and so is the software. Any support required as been great also. Well done Oura!"
4,J-Double,"Had v2.  It was fine.  Got v3.  Tracks a couple more things. Invaluable sleep tracking.  I cannot wear a watch at night it wakes me up. Ring you forget you have on.   To anyone thinking this is a day time tracker you are mistaken. None of that works. But that‚Äôs ok that‚Äôs not why I bot it. I wear the Apple Watch which is literally 10x the size.   It‚Äôs just a very good sleep tracker with HRV and pulse.    Don‚Äôt expect more, don‚Äôt be disappointed."
5,JohnAssaraf,I love mine so much. I got it for my sons and my wife and they all love it as well. I love keeping track of all of my vital health related and sleep related information.  Thanks.
4,lejrndjrirnsnnc,"Everytime you do an update my data collection stops working and it takes me a few days to figure it out. When I was in Turks in Nov, I had no day for two weeks following an update."
5,H.Puff,"Whoever added the pulse blips with haptic beats to the ""Heart rate and stress"" chart -- I see what you did there.  I see that the cursor flash/beat corresponds with the average heart rate as it changes throughout the day.  Best graph ever.  Beautiful."
5,Sachem user,"Love the app, a religious user here.   Had a performance issue a couple of months ago but support stuck with me until it was resolved."
2,Slp17501,"It is ridiculous that this app won‚Äôt show an actual body temperature, just plus and minus averages. If I could see my basal body temperature by paying a huge amount to sinc with the natural cycles app, you could put it in this app without additional cost! Way to sell out your own customers."
5,Max676788,Best technology for achieving better health through sleep and daily activity.  Tracks your movements more accurately than others and is the very best at analyzing sleep stages.  Worth the investment!!!
1,Mr. The Plague,"Despite multiple complaints to tech support, over the last couple years I frequently wake up with no sleep data because of a dead battery without any notification that my battery is low. They assure me that my ring isn‚Äôt the problem."
1,abcdefghijk69,"Newest update expanded the size of the stats on the Sleep and Readiness tabs, so now you can‚Äôt see all of your stats at a glance - you have to scroll. Why would you fix something that wasn‚Äôt broken, Oura? At least give us a ‚Äúcompact mode‚Äù under options if you are going to do this!"
2,gnoh,"but the little messages it sends are way off base. I consistently get less than 6 hours sleep, waking multiple times during the night. but Oura tells me ‚Äústill going strong.‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs meant to be encouraging but it makes me feel like I can‚Äôt trust it. Expensive and inaccurate."
5,RIPGRANTLAND,"Honestly it‚Äôs been great product so far for me. I am impressed with his accuracy, particularly it‚Äôs ability to detect late night, meals, and elevated heart rates after partying."
3,Sweatyhands27,My Oura ring app still have the old version. For some reason mine is not updating even after I uninstalled the app and the download it again. Old version still works though.
4,MimiH62,Battery indicates just under hal life and dies in the night often. Either the battery or the indicator need to read better so that this doesn‚Äôt happen.
1,Lego boy ,Been wearing the gen3 ring for two weeks now and the only disappointment I have is the constant disconnection from bluetooth. If you are going to compete with apple for wearable technology you are going to have to solve the connectivity issues. I never worried about whether my watch was constantly connected to my phone.
2,Rob28fg,Have had the ring less than 3 months. The app stopped showing the workout sessions that is imported from apple watch to apple health. Can the final daily analysis by oura ring be reliable if some of the data is missing? Reached out to Oura about this. Will update if resolved.
3,Bottfly,I love the ring and the app until this latest update! App no longer opens and will crash upon startup on iOS 15. Please fix this!! I look forward to upcoming implementations mentioned that are coming this year!
1,Yossix034,"The oura ring, as I now discovered, has 30 days return policy!  That includes an exchange request when the ring is defective. This is unheard of when you buy an expensive wearable device.  On top of it, customer service is horrible.   Do not spend hundred of dollars on a product that the manufacturer doesn‚Äôt stand behind."
1,kcfoot,Latest improvements made this useless for shift workers.   Need ability to turn off ‚Äúsleep regularity‚Äù function or I‚Äôll probably just stop wearing this after 4 years and switch to whoop. It is beyond annoying reading the poor regularity when‚Ä¶I work shift work (and checked that off when filling out the oura goals!)
1,phelinki,"I bought my ring before they had the $6/month subscription and now I‚Äôm not getting any sleep analysis because I declined to have to pay for a subscription when I had already paid $300 for the ring feels like a scam. Now, I only get a score without the needed analysis."
5,Dallas Rick,It‚Äôs great to keep you aware of your nightly sleep levels and helps you track yourself as you set goals in sleep and activity levels.
4,NatBarcellini,"I love oura and all the insights it's been giving me since I started using it. However, I would LOVE to see my readiness + sleep + activities scores on my apple watch. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars."
1,hivedrew,"I often go to sleep during the daytime, and I wake up after 6 pm, only to find out there is no recorded sleep cycle. However, the next day I see 2 different sleep cycles, it turned out that if you pass a certain daily threshold (maybe 5/6 pm) then Oura use that cycle as part of the next day."
1,tinapunkette,"Please fix this ASAP, I have not been able to sync my data for 2-3 days because the app crashes as soon as you try to open it. Invest in an Apple Watch! Sent this issue to their support and received a non answer. This is a waste of money and a waste of time. I regret spending $300 on this junk"
5,nick jonas's hot wife,"I love the app but am disappointed in the lack of widgets, why are there only ones for sleep? Why isn‚Äôt there a step one?"
5,Al Sky,I am wearing it for more than 4 years. It senses that I am getting sick long before I start to feel it. Cannot live without it.
1,ciparis,"Our most used feature (Sleep) now has a pointless navigational grouping requiring multiple taps instead of I just one ‚Äî every time we want to see it.   Why is a timeline the first thing I see? Where did the activity indicators go for Circles?  And worst of all, why is a woman‚Äôs cycle now shown at the top of their screen? Way to guarantee that female users never try to show anyone their Oura app again. Ever.   Sonos‚Äô app update (also a misguided redesign) was a disaster that should be fresh on everyone‚Äôs mind. Oura was my favorite app and a case study in simple yet effective design ‚Äî until this."
3,Rchen1997,"Love the product, but the latest app update is not good. Why make it harder to look at your past days and update information? Really frustrating, wish I could un-update."
3,JJungPhoto,Wish there was a way to customize and remove blocks. In it's new UI update there is just way to much unnecessary info flying around. Keep it simple... Old UI was 100x better than this mess
4,That one alaskan,Why have things like crypo chamber and not super common sense ones like ‚ÄúDepressed‚Äù? Which is different than ‚Äúsad‚Äù. Definitely check reddit for feature suggestions.
4,croozn,"I am very impressed with my Oura ring, but was surprised that sizes are limited to 13. For, that means my right ring finger is the only choice.  There is no way I can believe that NBA PLAYERS have size 13 middle or index fingers .  Are there no options for larger sizes?"
1,Obsessedwithtinythief,You buy this expensive ring and then you have to buy a subscription to access all of the data. Will never buy from them again. My friends RingConn does not require a subscription and I heard it collects data better. I will be getting one of those.
1,Cyncyn4,I know many people work a gen 2 having issues with their ring. Tbt moment gen 3 became available my ring stopped charging properly I depend on my data daily and it‚Äôs extremely disappointing that they will not replace my ring. If you are also experiencing this issue chime in so they are aware of their software issues!!!
1,AColomer,"After owning an Oura ring for over a year and loving it, app now crashing on trying to launch/open. Tried every fix out there and nothing works. Looked on multiple forums with hundreds of comments noted on the same issue. Very disappointing that nothing is being communicated by Oura about a fix."
4,Ermochenko Artem,One of the most useful and demanded functions ignored - it‚Äôs monitored sleeping stages pretty well - why don‚Äôt you add alarm or synchronized with default alarm to work smooth and be awaken in proper phase of sleep?!?!
1,Krsdj1,"People are saying this app is truly amazing we‚Äôll have you seen the live data for any information they are giving you ? Many other apps like Elite HRV will show you the data so you can then do your research,they claim you can see your body temperature but I cannot find it anywhere. I would be happy if there was like raw data for advanced users to see"
1,Cir6crx,Right out of the box the rings heart rate monitoring does not work at all. The app freezes and force closes on its own when trying to master reset. I have removed and reinstalled the app and restarted my phone and I get the same problems. The ‚Äúmoments‚Äù option just gets stuck on syncing and you have to force close the app. This thing seems very half baked.
1,copetersen,"I love my Oura ring, great for sleep tracking and stress tracking, but the new UI is showing me a very large banner that says ‚ÄúYou body has experienced more stress than usual today‚Äù on days where I have a couple of hours stressor more. I find that super stressful, the old UI still gave med the information, but without stress."
3,Kd2828,"Honestly I enjoy wearing my oura ring- however the user experience could be so much better.  There is no logical reason, now that the clock is passed midnight, why i can‚Äôt add my workout in for today‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so frustrating."
2,LisaP.13,Not impressed. There is no continuous heart rate monitor feature like on my fitness watch. It will take your heart rate periodically but most times I have to force it and even then it usually tells me it cannot check my heart rate. Over priced and under delivers for sure.
5,Disappointed Dian,Three rings and two chargers later my ring has quit working. I‚Äôm upset and don‚Äôt know what to do next.
5,flawedartist,"I‚Äôve suffered from insomnia for well over 10 years, but now that I can get accurate sleep as well as readiness data, I am a new woman!"
1,AGK1881,I‚Äôve use Oura for many years but for last few months it‚Äôs a nightmare. The app crushes every time I want to open it and now the ring and all features are useless because I can not access it. Very announcing. Devs DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. It‚Äôs not ok and not fun at all. So many reviews with the same problem and you can‚Äôt fix that. Very sad.
3,nodivisions,"Now the app is CONSTANTLY tracking my location, even when set to ‚Äúonly while using‚Äù. I have to keep manually killing the app to stop this. So obnoxious."
4,Mrfail,Oura is continuing to improve and I love the amount of data generated. I wish it would be a better data source for Apple Health.  I‚Äôd love to see it share HRV data for example.
1,iOS7 FULL FIX,"App crashes upon open, cannot access any of my ring data. Out of no where it just stopped working after 2 years of usage. Not happy since I‚Äôm trying to access my sleep data, the main reason I got the ring and the app doesn‚Äôt even function. Disappointing."
5,DiGiannantonio,I really enjoy my Oura ring and find its sleep tracking data very helpful. I‚Äôve never had any problems with using the App. Thanks Oura development team!
5,Jaszkowiak,"Love the new UI, however the latest versions have broken the dark mode icon."
5,AMJ_53,What more can I say; maybe that ‚Äúknowledge is power‚Äù and this ring provides you with a lot of knowledgeüòâ
5,vergillll,Insights are amazing but app itself had some catching up to do. Good to see improvements on entering workouts.
5,Cindy Manchester,I love this ring.  It was a gift from my daughter and is helping me monitor my sleep  and everything else in my life.  It‚Äôs changed it for the best.
1,Carl Thunder,"This product worked well when it worked.  About 3 days ago, the device failed to make a Bluetooth connection to my phone and another test phone as if Bluetooth just stopped working altogether.  Support is nowhere in site either.  It‚Äôs a good product but if this is a common issue which it seems, the business should be held accountable."
2,Michaeljgaeta,"Overall, I love the product and have been using it daily for over a year.   The support team, however, needs to set better expectations for what they do. I've been virtually one month without a new ring since the old one defected since requesting a new one under warranty.   Your service well vary widely depending on who is available. They really could do much better in keeping to a standard response time.   Seriously guys, just hire a few people from SE Asia to watch the inbox and problem solved. I'm sure it's upsetting many more people than it's worth."
2,Adelaide12,"With no way to correct bad sleep readings. I must move around during the early stages of sleep, because almost every night ours thinks I'm wide awake for the first 2 hours. as a result my sleep is captured as much less than it really is, and there is no way to report this as incorrect, or manually correct it in the app."
3,Hezmana ,The app goes through the battery very fast and caused my phone to stop charging somewhere around midnight due to overheating.  I can no longer leave the app and it‚Äôs Bluetooth on at night
1,cwcq777,It‚Äôs useless if you can‚Äôt connect to it and you don‚Äôt have the charger with you. Then you lose a whole day of data that you already paid for. I expect better way to troubleshoot at this price point. Who walks around with the charger just in case you lose connection! Ridiculous.
1,Wowserblue,"I deleted the app because I was having connection problems and after reinstalling, it wants me to start a new account.  There is no sign in screen to access my previous account and all the data from the past 3 years!"
1,nicstyles,The app is no longer crashing after upgrading to iPhone 14; however after a recent firmware update the ring battery only lasts around 2 days whereas it previously lasted close to a week. Too many technical hurdles over the past several months to rate higher than 2 stars.
1,user74930474,Can‚Äôt open the app to sync data. Have to delete app then reinstall they re-setup my ring which takes for ever. Oh the best part after it discovers my ring and starts the pairing process it just hangs there. You have to crash the app open it again then resume the process. Seriously?!?!
1,Glen7187,"I‚Äôve only begun to have this problem since iPhone 14 pro max and iOS 16. Have to delete the app, reinstall, it will be fine for a couple days, and then crashes again. Done it three times now. I will stop using the ring until a more stable version of the app is released."
5,fotosbyt.com,2 plus years & cannot wait to get the new one.
1,dvlrydr,"Why does the app need to be reloaded after every update?? It just updated yesterday and now this morning I can't get into the app, it force closes itself. It happens every time. Now I need to delete the app later today and reload it then add the ring again when I have access to the charger, let it download from the cloud, sync and finally work again.  Sometimes it's a toss up as to if the data from today is there or not. Very frustrating!! The ring, when it works is great, when the app takes a dump, obviously it's not so great..."
1,FitbyFate,"Great potential however, the software team has failed them. What‚Äôs the point of all this helpful data if I can‚Äôt access/sync it? Had the app for a year and plotted an average of one crash per 7.6 days. I have to re-download the app and start from square one. So frustrating."
1,Kauk4s,Oura app‚Äôs major update killed ability to turn off the screen during meditation‚Ä¶latest UI is a major step back as well compared to older version. Bombardment with ads to upgrade to latest gen is more than annoying. Oura went downhill after latest raises. Would not recommend.
5,KSJ28,I love the new updates. It makes it so much easier to see all my data at a glance.
1,savvanch,"The new UI is terrible, unnecessary, and not user-friendly at all. It‚Äôs all the same info as before but less accessible. You have to click to expand things you did not have to before. It makes me disinterested in using the app. Please change it back"
5,Zapx Resshuken,My ring hasn‚Äôt been updating for a week now. I‚Äôve tried everything.
3,ksfjanalfownsn,"Can you PLEASE add the Korean language as the app‚Äôs next language! I really want to get this Ring for my dad who has sleep apnea as this will be the perfect gift for him after his surgery!! I mean if you have Finnish, you can have Korean."
4,wontlet mepost,I like the ring and the information it provides. I wish it was more consistent with low battery  notifications..
3,Cokieffe,This device is great as long as you pay the 6.99 and keep the membership.  if you don‚Äôt the ring is basically useless and won‚Äôt send data to Apple health
2,erieliull,"Used to love it, but battery life is steadily getting worse and half the time my workouts won‚Äôt sync or they‚Äôll sync and then disappear.  Actually just ordered a whoop because this isn‚Äôt giving me accurate info anymore."
1,rokugin888,"Who knows the effectiveness of the ring since the app always crashes when you try to open. Have been in contact with the Customer Service team, and they have been unhelpful. DO NOT BUY ‚Äî save your money and go elsewhere."
3,iruy backwards,"1. Hand off is very confusing  when changing devices 2.  Stop with daily FW updates.  Compile them in a weekly or bi-weekly.  Each morning I wake up to an update. Requiring to go to App Store to update 3. Accuracy for activities needs improvement, does not measure peaked or spikes. I get it, you saving battery‚Ä¶ but should not be at expense of data precision. 4. Rethink material, when one lift weight, it scratches.  Offer bumper or such  4. Overall, I like an idea an form factor."
1,Ev Geniy,"My ring is useless $300 piece of plastic for 2 weeks - app crashes when you open it. New release has no fix, reviews are not getting opened, company doesn‚Äôt post any update on social media or website.  New Gen ring released 6 months ago and still app doesn‚Äôt support new features."
2,Mamma-gadget,"Got this for Christmas . Does not effectively do half of what they advertised. What happened to the temp reading, and predicting you are getting sick before you even realize. Thinks I am sleeping when I‚Äôm not, thinks I‚Äôm awake when actually sleeping. Their technology is lagging well behind their promises ."
3,jessielmv,My Gen 3 ring regularly doesn‚Äôt connect to the app. Following the instructions does nothing. I never had this problem with Gen 2. This is not an improvement. Gen 3 also scratches easily.
1,TurMaster,"As simple as it is to get a new iPhone when you loose or destroy your current one, and all your data safe in the iCloud. But you never ever able to sync your Oura Ring to your new iPhone. The support article suggests to disconnect the ring from your old phone first. Thank you so much, very helpful indeed!!!"
1,Dlepard,Stay away from company. If you like repeated canned responses when you have an issueZzz have at it. Not worth the headache. I would have upgraded to a third gen ring but they never sent an upgrade link to my app. Very unhappy and wish I had never purchase the right and the app is worthless.  Stay away.
5,Ajfare,This new one is so clunky and convoluted.
5,M5alive,Very accurate and very easy to use. Covers more than I ever expected.
5,ZzQueen22,Both my husband and I have one and it has helped us sleep better and exercise more! Highly recommend.
1,Jea9H,"How are there no default settings for monitoring post viral conditions!? Where nervous systems and cardio systems are completely out of sync and where increased activity is detrimental to recovery.   I‚Äôve turned on what you call rest mode and it seems punitive. We get gaslit enough by the medical industry, you don‚Äôt have to continue their awful behaviors."
2,- User123 -,"The Oura ring is ok. Mine lasted about 1.5 years before it died.  Pros: sleeker than an Apple Watch, sleep data seemed accurate, long battery life  Cons: bad at activity tracking, didn‚Äôt even last 2 years, have to take it off to lift weights, bulky for a ring, $6/mo subscription"
1,strokesimon,"Do not purchase this. I have the first version and battery life was fine. This latest version has a firmware issue that they say regardless of the ring, the battery log will suffer due to the firmware. They refuse to even look at if the ring is defective. Absolutely terrible customer service."
4,Shipsupt,Best and worse things are you forget you‚Äôre wearing it. Sleep tracking is a waste  no value added as well as no accuracy
1,Upsell champion,On newest version of Oura app and ring - app won‚Äôt open. Crashes immediately upon trying to open. Am on latest version of iOS 15.4. Have also tried restarting phone. Nothing works. No other apps having this issue. Super frustrating - can‚Äôt access my data at all.
3,JGGL07,"After the app was updated this week, the ring is no longer connecting and updating information."
1,g_i_o_,Nightmare. Waste of money. CONSTANT BUG PROBLEMS. Can‚Äôt edit sleep and I keep emailing them and they say the problem was fixed when it wasn‚Äôt. So all my slee data is inaccurate. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. They are in Holland to and take advantage of American consumers with unfair business practices and customer support which is literally non existent. purchase at your own risk‚Ä¶ beware.
1,slow professor,"A month ago I would have rated this app a 5. But after months utilizing it to support behavior change and succeeding, the current app issues and significant delay in getting the issues resolved has had a negative impact.   Wait till the tech issues are resolved before considering this tool."
5,Almeidfw,"The ring itself is wonderful, having Oura data on Apple Watch was what was missing from the app"
2,EPH6262,"That was the big draw of the oura ring and now it straight up doesn‚Äôt work. You log your data, and then it says it‚Äôs still unlogged. What‚Äôs the point then? Extremely disappointing."
4,rastamy79,It was better when it was free. Sure all the new features are great but I don't enjoy paying almost $7 a month for it.
5,plattecohighschooler,I‚Äôm very pleased with my Oura ring.  I hardly know it is there while it provides a lot of useful information.
4,HankWave,Had no problems until this afternoon and now it keeps crashing.
5,oursloveit,Can you tell us again what the colors mean? Red? Green?
1,Jumptank,"Their shift in strategies after their newest ring launched has been abysmal to loyal customers. Losing features unless we pay or upgrade. I enjoyed the data I was getting but will have to find it elsewhere, oura will get nothing further from me. Sad, they had something pretty cool."
4,Hopefulluser,I really like the ring and the app but the  current version of the app on iPhone draws a huge amount of power with Background Refresh on. The power drain drops significantly with it disabled.
1,tinamarie0214,The app is mediocre at best. Every single time I open it it takes up 20 to 60 seconds to update and connect to the ring. Sometimes it has issues connecting or updating at all. He and I have to close out the application and revisit at a later time in hopes that it works‚Ä¶
1,whiteghost2,"This is really bad experience. I‚Äôm see new features introduced but nobody fix the bug in core experience. If the ring can only last no more than 2 nights, what‚Äôs the point of it comparing to a wrist product?"
1,mgihdtv,"It doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to pay for the subscription, and the ring doesn‚Äôt seem worth it without the subscription.   If you have to pay for the subscription, you‚Äôre much better off with an Apple Watch."
5,IDK 989,"Helped me improve my sleep big time. I‚Äôm diagnosed with insomnia, and this helped me identify some of the root causes of my poor sleep."
1,Ssheky1,"This is probably the 4th or 5th time I‚Äôve tried to run the app and it crashes right away. Support is going to tell me to delete the app and reinstall it. However, I will lose data.   Absolutely tired of losing data because this company can‚Äôt develop an app that doesn‚Äôt crash."
3,lennon52,I literally can't use it at all anymore for the last couple of days since I updated.
1,Bakman11,I have done everything and app still keeps crashing on startup. Please fix your app as it‚Äôs not allowing me to track my data. I already submitted a ticket on your website and still no response a 4 days later. This is a joke for a $300 product.
2,Imgoingtodunkonyoumate,There should be an option to scroll through exact times on your sleep tracking
3,Dhaley13578,This ring is not accurate when it comes to calories burned. If you‚Äôre sweaty at all it won‚Äôt work right. It doesn‚Äôt work at all for hot yoga workouts. I take a walk around the block and it says 250 calories lol huh????
5,msember07,"Love my ring, excellent. Need the above upgrade, when will it available?"
1,music.2.my.ears,Honestly the map they added provides zero value I‚Äôve lost this thing so many times and it‚Äôs near impossible to find. I would attach an air tag if it was possible cause atleast their interface actually allows me to find things.
1,iheartTaiwan,Customer service is terrible You need to pay a monthly fee after using it for six months Costs more than an Apple Watch Apple Watch does everything it can do and more; even the sleep tracking if you buy series 8. It also costs cheaper !
5,smooth1999,"I am a long time meditator, lucid dreamer bio-hacker. Oura ring is an integral part of my life and helps keep me on track. I‚Äôd give Oura a 100% rating"
3,Wesleyrourke,One of the latest updates killed my rings battery and having all sorts of daily performance problems. Planned obsolescence anyone? Don‚Äôt update if you don‚Äôt have to Oura 2 users!
1,ourahatet,"I have a gen 2, and just updated my app. Now the app says ‚Äúyour membership is expired‚Äù. Except the membership is only for gen 3. Please fix this. My gen 2 ring is now completely useless. Not surprising considering your horrible customer service but even for you this is insane."
4,riverstreetbandito,"I‚Äôm enjoying all of the info and insights that the Oura ring provide, I do wish all of the data in the marketing and sales presentation was actually trackable in the app.  (Specifically SpO2)"
5,Bmj28,This product has changed my life.  It‚Äôs the best investment that I‚Äôve made to improve my health.  The ring is far superior to wrist-based wearables.
3,Garetjax1,"Used to indicate details about restlessness, and when I would wake up in the middle of the night. The latest firmware is less accurate than the prior version. üòû"
4,fbicking,I have grown to love the ring. The data is great for my training in cycling. The widgets did stop working with iOS 17 so hopefully they will get that fixed soon.
1,brvv23,Just received my oura today and when doing the initial onboarding the app crashed! For such premium and expensive product I‚Äôd expect more care from the company to the users. I hope I‚Äôll be able to change this review later
1,J@ ke,"Click on the app and it immediately crashes. Contacted support they said an update was coming. Update came, doing the same thing. Just trying to figure out how everything is so expensive and they cannot even maintain a working app?"
2,Portish,"Didn‚Äôt care much for the update, and the app must have read my mind because now it won‚Äôt even open.   Also rarely get effective syncing with Apple health with regard to fitness tracking."
5,maya9poppy,My husband got me this for Christmas... I use it everyday and definitely suggest it! It gives you the exact time you fell asleep which I love!
5,debbruce,I like the level of detail that Oura gives me about my activity and sleep. It keeps me focused on the right balance in life.
5,Robbie Pagina,Really interesting to study my sleep data. Already making improvements to my habits. Got my first triple crown day today!!!
5,MEischend,Allows you to fine tune and test various health/fitness strategies. Generates a bunch of data that can be used in many ways.
5,jonjonart,I have had an aura ring for about 5 years.  My sleep and mood have improved.  Great technology!
1,Unhappy fidelity customer,"They moved all the information around, hid important things like HRV, and completely removed one of the only differentiators of the entire product! Why would you stop reporting body temperature!?  There is literally no reason to use this product any longer!"
5,K8wxwise,"I‚Äôve had my ring for about 3 months now and really love all the insights it has given me.  Body Temperature, Cycle, HRV and activity.  It‚Äôs great!"
5,trailmovin,"I‚Äôm a long distance hiker in the mountains of SW Virginia, and have found the data to be very helpful, in understanding my sleep and exercise."
5,happdaddy,"So comfortable and amazing tracking of your sleep, calories burned and everything else about your health and wellness."
4,Stregz,Love oura but my widgets are no longer working since the latest update
2,Joshimitsu,"I‚Äôve had the Oura ring for 6 months. In that time under never had the Oura app import workout data from the Apple Health app.  I‚Äôve worked with Support for two months and they are stumped.  Given how commonplace data import between apps is today and that managing, analyzing, and visualizing data is the point of Oura, this gets two stars from me.  Sure I could manually add the workout data, but that the price point for the hardware and software, I shouldn‚Äôt have to."
1,Gggggoooooo,"I have been using Oura for years now, and the ring is worthless without the app. Way too expensive of a ring to deal with this. I have talked to numerous people with the same problem and we are all talking about throwing our rings away."
5,blakkmamba,Great concept but app needs more work to fully unleash the potential of the product
3,MamaHC,I like the app but I put it on metric and it will not change to miles and pounds it still has me at kilogram andKilometers. Super frustrated right now so if you can help me fix that I would give it 5 stars if not It‚Äôs a 3
1,Mogehovi,"I had the first generation ring and liked it‚Ä¶the app was straightforward and easy to pair the ring.  I cannot pair the new ring‚Ä¶the app can‚Äôt find it and troubleshooting just takes me to a sales page.  The ‚Äúsetup‚Äù page does not yield the screens in the tutorial, and ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù just lists articles to read."
5,Imogene49,Amazing amount of data! I have been very pleased would definitely buy again.
5,Stephen Pellegrino,"After several years, an indispensable resource. HR while running as good as a chest strap. Wish there was a 2 min standing HRV though."
1,M........t.........y,"This is the second update in the past few days that was supposed to present a new layout and additional features for more activities erc but again, nothing shows in the app. What is going on here?"
1,Dum birds,"My ring stopped working on Sept 6th, it is now Sept 25th. I‚Äôve yet to talk with a support tech about my ring.üò• I‚Äôve tried all the trouble tips that the app includes yet none have worked. This is not acceptable for the amount of money I‚Äôve paid for this ring."
2,wtskip,"Ring appears to be working but not accurately I have been making excuses for it sense I purchased it.    Now just 4 weeks out of hospital I am counting on it to give me accurate information about beating of heart and it is not.  I thought that maybe recharging and updating, might solve problem.   It has not and I see nowhere else to turn, I get platitudes from application tried to update but I have the latest.    lI bought on recommendation from books written by TonyRobbins and Peter Diamandis."
1,Ro in LA,This needs to be rolled out in 2022 as indicated in your web site. Actually you have less than 30 days or this ring will be returned for a full refund. I searched pulse ox sleep monitor and I bought your product that does not monitor my oxygen. Very misleading and disappointing. I predict I will be asking for a refund.
5,JT-Rex,"The Oura app is easy to use, visually friendly and gives a wide range of health data. I highly recommend the Oura ring and the the app."
1,Ki7ulya,"Customer support is ridiculous. I got a ring a week ago, but I can not activate my email.  Trying to resolve the issue for a week now. As a Qa, I know what to do to sign up. But it looks like the sign up part have not been tested  at all. Very upsetting such an outstanding product! Shame."
3,Thatchman2,"If you download this app onto a second IOS device, even just for mirroring purposes, it won‚Äôt sync data. Ring finish scratches very easily, and square edges are painful"
5,Blee597,Couple this with a few notes to track Pre bedtime habits has increased my deep sleep and made me more alert during the day.
1,Art mike,"Forgot to wear during my walk. Doesn't auto get data for it from iPhone activity monitor. + to add manually disappeared.  Other night slept 5 hours, up for 1, back to sleep for 1.5. It said I‚Äôd slept only 1.5 It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, but it should be easy to fix its errors or mine. Now it‚Äôs impossible"
5,bigchinasean,It‚Äôs hard to believe that this ring does all that it says it does. But it does. The app is good.
1,DisappointedinColorado,Not very accurate. I like the idea of the daytime stress feature but when I am stressed to the max it says I am ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù and then it shows me as stressed out when watching a movie. It‚Äôs just not very accurate or reliable.  Same issues with sleep and readiness. The ring is inconsistent with detecting exercise and movement.
2,@bleausMike,The app keeps on crashing customer service is unavailable no one to call or have an online chat for the price of the ring they should do much better than that
2,Gyella,"Ring stopped tracking sleep with is the only reason I wanted it. Tried all the online ways to fix, still broken. I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money on one of these."
5,manalii,"The Oura tracks key health metrics : temperature, breathing rate, sleep stats, activity levels plus HRV and more. It helps me track illnesses, body stressors and modulate for them. I love it."
3,e00d,"Oura ring records as soon as I wake and active, but when I‚Äôm sleeping and not moving I get no data at all‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll try a different finger, although I doubt that‚Äôs the issue."
5,hihealthy,"I really like Oura‚Äôs features, style and practicality. Would be great to have a reduced dashboard for Apple Watch but otherwise fully satisfied. Highly recommend it."
5,Big Lew 3234,I love tracking my activity without having to wear a silly watch!!
5,Anastasia Logunova,"Thanks for great app, please add simple ‚Äútotal sleep‚Äù in hours with sleep score widget. No one really needs the sleep stages as a widget. Thanks"
3,money grab and rigged,"The cycle insights card is not informative at a glance and when I click on it, I have no idea what the ‚Äúinsights‚Äù are. The graph just wasn‚Äôt displayed in a helpful way.  I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but it‚Äôs not that."
1,KET¬•¬£,The ring has never worked.  Customer service said that there is a universal problem that they have been working on to fix.  It has been months!  What is the point of wearing the ring if there is no data?  Really terrible!
5,SpennGlenn,I made a sizing error with my order and their customer support helped me resolve my issue.
1,Beanerrific,The ring is fine - tells you some interesting sleep information - but the app and the cookies make it impossible to change and update any settings or personal information. I have no time for such ridiculousness.
1,Kylerserfass,Upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone 13 pro and app crashes every time I open it. Worked perfectly fine on old phone. I gave it a couple weeks to see if an update would push a fix but still doesn‚Äôt work.
1,dglesser,"In the last few weeks, the Oura App on my iPhone 12 has been completely crashing. In fact it wont start up at all. I‚Äôve had to delete the app and reinstall it 3 times now. It will work for a few days and then CRASH! Please fix this issue!"
5,Siili1967,Has helped me to make better decisions to get better sleep. Learning all the time more about what affects my recovery.
1,treynolds1,"Haven‚Äôt been able to connect to ring after latest update. I tried contacting support, it‚Äôs  2 weeks and haven‚Äôt heard a thing. A lot better products out there that also have some level of customer service."
1,#Creative67,10 months in and the ring stopped holding a charge. Lasts 8 hours- so don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to wear it all day- have to remember to put it on at night now. What a pain. No response from the company after multiple requests to fix the problem. Their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù link in their webpage does not work.
5,Madam Nai,You guys didn‚Äôt amazing with the ring! Now we need to make the app to be the top 10.
2,CaitWit28,Allegedly there‚Äôs a new app that‚Äôs completely redesigned. My app has had three updates to it in the last week and not once as the design inside the app changed as outlined in the description.
5,Rocket1532,I have had my ring for over a year & it was the best decision. 90 lbs down & more to go!!!
5,HPSenoir,The best tool for getting to know your body.
1,JLynn #1,"App states there is an update but when you open the app and click the update button, it just spins constantly and then eventually just closes the App Store. It has done this for over a week now. Not sure how to get the actual update to load."
1,DJ JOE CAPELLO,I see here that other people are experiencing the Crash Bug. The app now crashes immediately upon opening. No fix. No communication. Nothing.   I suppose I could un-install the app and re-install it but I would lose all my data. I keep hoping for the app update that never comes.
4,Prize66,Love the ease and simplicity of the ring. The sleep info and readiness info are great. Wish the app was more like Fitbit that shows week to date totals. Showing individual days only is insufficient.
4,Chubbyslatte,When I wake up my activity score is 90-92. Shouldn‚Äôt it start higher and drop throughout the day if I‚Äôm inactive?
5,quaZorba,The AI adjusts the measurements to suit me specifically. I have learned a lot about what I can and should not be doing by watching my data.
1,Dirtydylan,I bought the ring thinking the subscription would be a choice for more features.  It‚Äôs mandatory if you don‚Äôt agree to the subscription you can‚Äôt continue the set up.    It‚Äôs a scam. Returned the ring and made an Instagram story letting people know about this predatory practice.
3,Rujen Amatya,The widgets worked fine on the iPhone but now it has stopped working on the lock screen. It‚Äôs just an empty space instead of the scores
1,Pmcwilli,"Recent update drains battery! Previously got about 2-3 days, after update, barley a full day. Super frustrating as this seems to happen frequently after updates! Go to bed with 75% charge and dead when I wake up. Oura needs to do better."
2,Tech tech34,"It‚Äôs terrible at picking up naps. Woke up from a three hour nap and I won‚Äôt know until tomorrow if this nap is going to register or not on the app, how much deep sleep I got and how much REM, etc. Frustrating.   If you don‚Äôt take any naps, I think it‚Äôs about 70-80% accurate."
1,Jaie ,I‚Äôve used this app for years now. Have never had a problem. The app now for the past week crashes every time I try to open it. Ring is pretty useless with the app. I was hoping last update for app would fix that but so far nothing.
1,Vjjemsen,I really want to purchase this ring but these recent reviews really aren‚Äôt looking good What‚Äôs happened to the product is it being made in China now? It went from getting 4-5 stars to -1  Something caused this I really would like some input from Oura??
5,Bazbol Fan,Battery life lock screen widget not working. Update: rebooted and updated the widget and now it works.
1,Nyfoodlover007,The Oura ring claims to track your REM sleep. I searched on the Oura site how it does so. There is not one word explaining this. How can a ring on your finger track rapid eye movement? So I looked on the web and came across medical articles that explain the ring is totally unreliable. Sadly I did this after buying and using the ring. Hopefully others will be spared.
5,ShanMarq,"I love this ring, immensely.  The data, the support, the constant increase in its functionality - all while being stylish enough to wear daily, dressed-up or down.   Every time I think they‚Äôre ‚Äúdone,‚Äù more data and info are offered in the app and I‚Äôm just amazed.  Buy this ring already!"
1,Upshah,Not worth the ring as you have to buy premium membership. Return policy is 30 days but they give you 30 days of free premium membership. Once the membership ends you get no data unless you pay another 72$ per year. What a shady company.
5,jammin245,Can‚Äôt live without! Now I know what kind of day I‚Äôm going to have when I wake up!
3,jaipatel1,Anyone else have this issue?
5,ALLDAY88,It‚Äôs running my life. I need to know everything about me.
2,Insomniac2nite,I bought this specifically for tracking my stages of sleep. It‚Äôs superior for comfort vs wearing a watch to bed but the info is only a graph of your heart rate. The fit bit and Apple Watch display stages of sleep and periods of wakefulness. I have buyers remorse.
2,JR8419,Has been almost a year and is doing really well but now I can‚Äôt get out of rest mode. No matter what I do rest mode does not turn off.
1,NT00,"Everything was fine.  Easy to view.  Activity, Sleep, Recovery  Then someone tried to make it better.  Well, it is a huge step backwards.  Your survey group needs to be adjusted to reflect reality and not the ideas of the product manager."
5,marjawalker,"My app quits, it says if I delete it and re download I will loose all my data"
3,blair_42,I just got my ring and was excited about the watch app.  I was disappointed to discover it wouldn't work with my older series 5.
2,kelssssb,"Every since the update, all this app does is freeze and crash. It‚Äôs so hard to see the data because I have to constantly close and reopen the app."
2,tihkal2,Ring use to be way more accurate and pick up on 10 minute naps. Now it doesn‚Äôt even pick up on 20 min to 3-4 hour naps that occur after the initial sleep session. It‚Äôs been like this for months now what‚Äôs up
1,Eeeest1267--,"Oura has now an awful business model charging for subscription in addition to charging for the device. I hope the founders read this and see how subscription is the worst idea for hardware company, and how customers bounce and leave the product. Like i did."
1,Ibiondo44,"This is a review for the app itself and not the ring. Updated today and the app keeps crashing. I am not able to see any data from the ring, which makes it a useless thing in my finger"
5,GLCMACL,Helpful to see how many things affect both sleep and performance.
4,7263738292,Overall a good app but I want to put some sleep and readiness widgets on my Home Screen. Would just be nice to see them at a glance.
2,rome4112,"The app is pretty buggy, does not sync with Apple Health correctly most of the time. Customer support does not respond and ignores user issues ‚Äî for a $300 product, there should be support if the product doesn‚Äôt work."
5,%%#%>,When will this app be updated to work with IOS 16??? App keeps crashing.
3,ejdnabanaq,If you like paying monthly for error messages when you add a workout this is app is for you
5,Jkpinel,"Oura Ring is an awesome wearable!  I wear it in conjunction with my Apollo Neuro, and the combination is fantastic.   The Oura has helped me focus on my health and with the Apollo Neuro has reduced my stress and increased my focus.   I‚Äôd recommend this wearable to anyone. My only problem with the device is the cost. It‚Äôs quite pricey, but if you have the extra cash, it‚Äôs worth it."
5,lorrainaman,Love the oura however the battery dies so fast now. Used to go a week and now its 2-3 days.
1,Bubbsbuddy,"Wanted to love Oura so badly, went with it over Whoop but it ended up being a sad mistake.    If you need anything from a support perspective you‚Äôre better off waiting for the tooth fairy‚Ä¶might be great technology but though to shell out $400+ on the hardware and be on the hook for $6/mo forever w/o any support."
5,AnnoyedAF!!!!!!!,amazing product and customer support! great company. i‚Äôve been using it for a few years now. the feedback my ring gives me every day goes a long ways to helping me keep myself healthy. they go above and beyond to keep customers happy.
5,Dooreemon,Show my chronotype doesnt do anything after clicking. Ios 16.4 iphone 13 pro max
1,EP 2015,"My ring didn‚Äôt fit and I returned it for the smaller size, which was too small. There are no half sizes and if it doesn‚Äôt fit properly, it won‚Äôt work. They won‚Äôt provide a refund! This company is absolute trash."
3,Dazzlinds,It doesn‚Äôt seem to be catching my REM cycles lately.  I know I‚Äôm dreaming as I can recall the dreams about an hour before I wake up but nothing showing on app.  Makes me question the rest too
1,jessicaanneweiss,Terrible customer service ‚Äì received the sizing kit and all sizes were too big. No way to get in contact with them via chat/call. Unacceptable for a $250+ product. Look elsewhere if you want actual tech support on expensive health tech.
4,Mshaich9,Should have ability to add a custom tag when reviewing sleep
5,none.19000091,Where you can record your workout HR it would be cool to have a label for meditation.
5,toppy grey,Had mine for a few months and could not be happier with it.
5,Sir Gallahad,Get rid of the annoying ring clippy assistant No one liked it in Microsoft office. No one likes it here  Edit: They got rid of the Oura ‚Äúclippy‚Äù IYKYK
2,Rick9-9,Idk know if it‚Äôs the app or the ring But either one isn‚Äôt helping solve the problem with the ring trying to Connect did all your steps and everything still nothing is working
2,55 lb bar,Products works good. But would be nice if it came in sizes for larger people. Was lucky to fall in limit of wearing on pinky (I hate pinky ring however) but many athletes we coach are unable to wear one at all. I spoke with Oura was was basically told they don‚Äôt care about population with larger muscle mass. Disappointing.
3,DT6226,My ring does not consistently track my walks. The response from the developers has been a shrug.
1,Beans!!!!! Beans‚Ä¶.,They took away the white noise session I used to listen to and now you can‚Äôt have your iPhone on silent mode and play the stories/mediations‚Ä¶. So if I fall asleep and then get a text I‚Äôll wake up. Cool.
1,Trowre,The times when I need it the most (traveling) it performs the worst.  Software is not set up for traveling.  It glitches and loses data with multiple time zone changes.  Not at all helpful when it could be the most useful.
5,ClaribelT,Great product and amazing app. As a marathoner who is focused on keeping my health on track the Oura ring has been a great edition to my health routine.
1,Dr Bernice White,I feel conned! I was very happy with my Oura ring (purchased December 2021 US$400) then suddenly I lost access to my daily results because of a membership scam. I considered joining the membership US$5.99 a month & have endured an inability to sign up because I do not have a USA address. All I want to receive is the sleep data & daily activity but I have been cut off from this.  I am not particularly interested in all the other bells & whistles & now feel forced to join the membership. It is not acceptable  Dr Bernice White
1,SarahMercer,"Worked on first reboot after OS upgrade.  Stopped working after next phone reboot - crashes on open. (This is on an iPhone XS.)  Will update review if it starts working again / app gets updated / it works when I switch phones - in the meantime, beware!"
1,being brig vern,"Product is great and I‚Äôve been using it for over 4 years. Please bring back the old iOS UI, the change after the update is cluttered and difficult to read. Don‚Äôt fix what was not broken."
5,Beadle juice,I studied HRV at Columbia univ NYC in the early ‚Äò90‚Äôs but had no way to measure it or use its benefits. Oura is a great way to manage your health and optimize your biohacking!
1,dmp212,I‚Äôve tried updating my software on my phone and restarting and nothing is working to fix the app from crashing when trying to open it.   I also couldn‚Äôt find a way to contact customer support.
3,reviewer 747474,I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled it several times. It freezes after loading.
1,tralalalatte,"I loved my Oura ring until the last 2 app updates - now it‚Äôs unable to accurately communicate with my Apple Watch, record my activity, etc. My new ring is scheduled to arrive this week. If the result is the same, I will return the ring."
1,ajdroom0956,"I cannot believe Oura is moving to a subscription model. I no longer want to use a health ring if I have to pay to see what the results. Ridiculous.  Save your money and get a Apple Watch, at least you can see your data for free‚Ä¶"
5,Inkedbrunette,I have had my ring for 2.5 years. I love it!!!
5,deverman,The ring and the interface are both elegant. I recommend it to my friends.
4,bballard3,"BUT! Not perfect, the editing boundaries feature can link points in an unintended way leading to areas that cannot save due to intersecting paths."
2,clashroyaleisrigged,The ring never works because the app is so slow to load data. The ring doesn‚Äôt track my sleep or heart rate half of the time as well.
2,TheKetoEmpire,I log onto my app this morning & it says I was chosen to be part of the beta testing for the new app. Cool. Sure. Why not?   I do the steps and go back to my app to find out I have to connect my entire ring and my data is done.   ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
1,Iquazii2,It doesn‚Äôt last long. It is a self destructive ring after few years weather you used it or not the battery will go bad so you have to buy a new one! It is a marketing scam!
2,Robmbailey,Generally love my Oura and have been using one for years. But the latest sleep algo seems too pessimistic. There are significant disparities between time in bed and sleep time that also don‚Äôt correlate with my iwatch data.
3,fjioejroiewjrsndflkwjrpo3jrsek,The new visuals are a big step backwards. The information used to be ‚Äúglanceable‚Äù but now requires scrolling to see everything.
2,Cccccooioo222,"The new version of the app does record some exercises like spinning, indoor cycle. If you input it, end of the day it erases it and does not reflect workout, heart rate etc. Was not a problem with earlier version."
1,Smdncjfj,The newest update with font and colors makes it impossible for some people to focus  and be able to read the app. I would suggest getting a UI/UX expert to see what this has done to the user experience including making unaccessible to those with visual impairments.
4,Kkubed,"The detail in what your sleep looks like is great!  It seems to accurately match my wake and sleep times.   I wish it told your actual temperature, not just the range."
3,depauw19,Need help with the new update to the app. I updated it via the App Store but the app itself doesn‚Äôt reflect the new updated layout.
1,Alehanders,i‚Äôve had the new app since it was released and still don‚Äôt get it. the information architecture feels random and a cruel departure away from what I actually want to see (tabs for sleep vs activity vs overall readiness and other insights)
2,MeganDallas,"Love the ring, hate the new app update. The app isn‚Äôt user friendly at all. And suddenly my steps per day are only 3k even after I walk for an hour and a half?"
2,susansta,Got the new IPhone 16 and iOS 18 .. it doesn‚Äôt capture/sync my naps and activities anymore.. I don‚Äôt really care about the new look for the app .. make it function like it should
5,JCT1776,This will change your life.
5,bigjohn6666,I am loving this app and my Aura ring . It functions as promised and much easier to wear than a smartwatch or Tracker .
1,Masha Jab,They have these updates and god forbid you update it like it happened to me with the last one and now my ring is useless. Tech support after running me around told me to buy a new ring‚Ä¶
1,Swanjj48,"Version 4.3.1 if you‚Äôre going to make a UI change that displays the data in a more cluttered less readable format for the purpose of making the font bigger, give a display option. The visuals on this update are trash."
3,Sk8erBoi777,"Great app, but I‚Äôve had to reinstall because airplane mode has caused connection failures multiple times.  Please look into that."
1,FB Music,"can‚Äôt believe how bad this is, a new ring delivery and now that app is not syncing with phone even though bluetooth says it‚Äôs connected.  This is not good and will drive us away from the ring. please fix this asap."
3,R.   B,Please go back to the previous Sleep UI where you can see all Sleep contributors in a single view
1,Angels & shadows,"For two weeks now when I go to open the app, it will flash open then immediately close. The ring is useless at this point. When it worked I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Jacob Masters,Please make a widget for this app! I would love the widget on my Home Screen for quick data.   Love the product 1000%
5,MrsD927,This ring has been a game changer for me! It has really helped me in my health journey as a woman.
1,ebaie81,I have been in love with my Oura ring and this app since I bought one back in September 2021‚Ä¶. Until this week.  The app is constantly crashing and has not open successfully for me at all. I am now wearing a $300 paperweight and am highly disappointed.
4,UW fan 4256,"Love the ring so far. I'd like to see a dashboard that gives real time analytics like heart rate, body temp, and SP02 blood oxygen level. Maybe a running section that tracks your run."
1,rdog66,"Been using the app for ~8 months and it‚Äôs been working great. However, in the last few weeks I‚Äôve noticed a steady decline in battery life and in the last few days my ring no longer connects. I‚Äôve opened a few requests, but have yet to hear back."
3,xxx69tentacion696969,I strongly dislike the update and much prefer the old layout.
4,Whoisthisedguy,"App is still buggy. Missing days. Strava not syncing correctly.   Nice hardware, now work on the app."
1,Ripsi2288,This is my second Oura ring I‚Äôve had. The battery starts to die almost exactly when the warranty expires. I don‚Äôt believe it to be a coincidence. Will not be purchasing a third ring at this point they have lost my trust and faith as a customer
1,floo65m,Don‚Äôt buy one or subscribe as they make it impossible to get your money back if you change your mind - even within the 30 day window.  Even if it causes a rash like it did for me.
1,PrimeCipher,"Sort reviews by date submitted and you‚Äôll see that this app is going in the toilet. It used to be phenomenal, and with every release, it just gets worse. After well over five years of wearing an oura ring, I‚Äôm debating if it is worth it."
1,aideefanboy,Before it used to give some basic sleep data for non-subscribers but not it's basically a $350 dumb ring if you don't pay extra every month
1,Chrisx216,Update the app already !!! It renders everything about this expensive device useless without being able to access the data. For more than a week to go by is inexcusable and unacceptable.
5,The widow 101,Needs to have app for watch
1,Kris1883,"I have always appreciated the company and the CEO's mission but since the ≈åura ring 3 customer service is gone, their focus seems to be elsewhere with canned responses and do not respond to your questions. It's completely turned me off to the ring and the company..."
5,Ivan Kirigin,"I‚Äôve used lots of devices and wearables, and a ring is by far the best form factor. The app does a great job explaining all of the advanced measures."
2,baikley,"What I would really love to see is features where you are able to see in the moment data of what your heart rate currently is, steps or what the definition of an active minute is, etc"
4,Harsh Rajkumar,"After the most recent update to 3.7.0, the app has become very buggy: - unresponsive UI - ring fails to connect  That said the app itself looks really good. I did like the previous color scheme as well. Would be awesome if we were to be able to choose different themes.  Hopefully, the issues will get resolved soon :)"
5,Brennen R,This thing is awesome! The information it provides is interesting!
3,H2O Wreck,"Unfortunately when I am on a riding lawn mower or ATV the ring actually thinks I‚Äôm running. I also wish it had real time update for heart rate, hrv etc.  Other than that, I love it."
1,Hiker1234567,really bad design that sleep graph only shows 2 hour increments.  also very bad that i cannot add my notes and tags on the sane screen where my sleep graph is.  have to switch back between sleep screen and home screen to relate my notes to my sleep graph. makes no sense and makes tracking my sleep very cumbersome.   also would be really useful if i could add custom tags.  and the wirst is that all the notes and tags get erased if you ever have to reinstall the app which i had to do because it kept freezing up.
3,bigphill16,"The app is pretty good and the ring is real good. But lately the app is crashing and when you try to go to the menu, it stops working."
5,richxps,"This ring is great , use both Apple Watch and the ring for the perfect combo."
3,RJ 27,After a recorded workout please bring back the max heart rate graph after workout has ended.   Please integrate peloton so I can record my heat rate while I‚Äôm riding.   Thank you
1,klaar1,It crashes immediately when you open it and there is no customer service to contact.
1,Carlosxe,"After the trial for the membership ends this ring is useless, it‚Äôs been a month since i stopped using It, i just use my Apple Watch more features and no membership required"
1,Swass!,New updates have led to the ring‚Äôs battery life being horrendous. Even with oximeter turned off. I‚Äôve had my ring for a year and the updates have ruined a once great product.
1,Maggiecubanita,Can someone please fix this constant crashing issue?! I have been using this app for about a year now and all of a sudden it has started crashing and has been doing so for the last week. Help!! üòîüòî
1,DrDPepper,Have to delete and reinstall the app every few days since they adopted the subscription model. REALLY looking forward to more competition in the smart ring space.
3,Town of games,great product and app. one thing the developers can improve is the ability to create your own tags.
1,J. Review,"First off, it‚Äôs literally impossible to cancel the subscription. The support team is awful -I‚Äôd ra the ear deal with comcast support at this point. Returning the incorrect product is a fight. Everything about this company screams red flag scams. If you buy it anyway, be prepared to pay to wait."
1,The Water's Surface,"Previous version enabled user to start unguided meditation session then allowed user to use another app (e.g., Muse meditation headband) then switch back to Oura app to review heart rate, HRV and skin temperature. Upgrade takes this feature away.  Please put this feature back in."
1,glo10,"I can‚Äôt believe the developers can‚Äôt figure out a way to allow users delete erroneous sleep cycles. How hard would it be to make sure our data is correct.  Were paying a monthly rate, please fix this :("
5,Industrial engineer,"It is a practical nice looking great device, great companion during Pandemic helped predict changes in your health."
3,Sanr321,The ring has a big price tag and while I love the ring and its functionality- the paid app is a bit of a trap üëéüèº
1,mufcmatt,I‚Äôve now had 3 Oura Rings. Soon will be 4 because the product degrades so much over time. My ring won‚Äôt charge and I contacted Oura 5 days ago. They respond every 2 days or so and say they will get back to me. I can‚Äôt stand this company.
1,Addie#1Fred#2,I loved my Oura when it worked‚Ä¶ everything I‚Äôve done to trouble shoot has not worked. You can‚Äôt reach a ‚Äúreal‚Äù person. They just push you to the FAQ‚Äôs as if I didn‚Äôt try it. Big money spent for nothing.
1,chiosios,Bought the ring for $300 and they want me to pay an additional $100/ year for the app? Nope! Junky app that doesn‚Äôt even measure my sleep correctly. I am awake at night and it keeps saying I‚Äôm sleeping. What a joke.
2,insignia2002,I asked for customer service on Juiy 2nd and still have not heard from anyone.  I have the ring paired to my iPad but cannot get it paired to my iPhone. Not what I expect for service for such an expensive ring.
1,njahou,These people had me  mail in my gold colored ring to get an update then sent me an email Jan 27th saying the new ring was shipped. Now May 5 and still no ring.  My kids bought me one so I would have something to wear since I don‚Äôt want a watch. They are crookS.  NEVER RESPOND TO EMSIL SUPPIORT TICKETS JUST SAY HOW BUSY  THEY ARE.  RIBBING OTHER PEOPLE probably.
5,mljohnson983,I‚Äôve had it for over a year now and it‚Äôs working great.  Worth every penny
5,Joseph*1948,I I wish the phone app added  the real sleep we get. Naps +sleep . It should be easy to update the app to do this
1,kpod2020,"Just when you get used to something and are able to use it to your advantage, they mess it up. The new update is horrible. I won't be buying generation four."
3,Amirmaz90,The app does not import hear rate data from apple Health app. You get no heart rate data on this app when you have apple watch on but not the Oura ring.
4,Beckmone,Had to replace mine and didn‚Äôt realize the new one required subscription. But really useful.
1,Does it matter21739592648,"Worked for a week‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt connect anymore. Every single ‚Äúfix‚Äù they have online doesn‚Äôt help. I told customer service that, and they emailed me the list of their ‚Äúfixes‚Äù again.."
1,mindmuze,I just updated my app and none of my data will load from my ring to my app. It‚Äôs just keeps saying updating.. the update will finish and then no stats uploaded and it will say updating again.
1,hhfrfvnj,This app was great but a few days ago it stopped working on iOS. It crashes immediately after opening. Oura needs to fix this asap.
2,Exichas,App has not been able to open for last several days. 14 max pro latest os
1,divinitynine,Having to reinstall app around every 1-2 weeks because it just stops opening and stays in that fatal loop. This is for the last 4 months or so. On an iPhone 13 Pro.    This whole Oura experience is getting tiresome.
3,KapeoKapeo,Every day there will be 3-6 hrs where it says ‚Äúno data‚Äù. Extremely frustrating
3,Bham Biker,Hi I bought the Oura 3 for the SAO2 functionality? Is that coming soon? So far I don‚Äôt notice any difference between the Oura 2 and Oura 3 rings.
5,4698-364;,It helps me to learn what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs not for my sleep and to slow down and get more rest.

5,EarningsBarrage,Beat wearable device I have tried so far.
2,pcho614,"The app looks nice but I want to be able to know what my body temperature is running at, what my current hrv is, what my current heart rate is. The ability to set choose sleeping range outside of sleep for naps. More accurate step counting."
4,Lindalalaland,Great but wish it could track my yoga or Pilates workouts with more accuracy
1,nihaohenhao,"The ring costs more than 250 dollars and if I don‚Äôt pay for a subscription I get almost no information. Fitbit is cheaper, and when not paying you get a lot more!"
1,Dr. Roofer,These rings are really expensive. After owning one for 3 months they started charging me for a monthly subscription. What a rip off! You will be finding my ring on eBay. I recommend a Fitbit or Garmin product. Much more functionality for a better price.
1,Chainb0y,"After every update now, need to uninstall the app, reinstall, resync ring, etc. Please figure out what‚Äôs going wrong before you release another update."
2,nancywontoobee,When switching phones to iPhone 13 pro the app can‚Äôt connect despite cloud transfer. This version of the app needs fixed.
1,naba21213,"I keep getting a message ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and app won‚Äôt open. I updated my phone, deleted app and reinstalled and connected to wifi and fully charged. Seems to be bug."
1,Tonyyy134567,Great technology only if the charger works properly ‚Ä¶ keeps blinking red so I need to stay near by the charging station to constantly reconnect the ring on the charging device ‚Ä¶ the ring is a size bigger - I emailed the company 14 days ago and never received a email back ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
1,Molls255,"I love the ring and information, but I do not care for the app. I wish I could create and manage my own dashboard. I would also like to manage other settings. I don‚Äôt need the pretty pictures on the dashboard. I want information, graphs, dials, etc."
5,Prosecute corrupt grumpy,1.  Keep increasing the accuracy.  2.  Please!!!Get phone representatives  to answer questions.
4,jmsgryn,"Should be able to post to prior day and to correct improper time postings, pm when it should be am."
4,Oura ring,I have downloaded the new update but the new screens are not appearing for me. What should I do?
2,Benji1098,"The readings are woefully inaccurate. Customer service is unhelpful and often non-responsive. In my opinion, this ring is definitely not worth the price, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend purchasing it."
3,mingrosec,App has recently started to pause any media playing when it‚Äôs launched.
1,MikhailM,"I downloaded and redownloaded the new app, but the interface hasn‚Äôt change and looks nothing like in the preview screenshots. I submitted an IT ticket with them 3 days ago and have yet to hear back."
1,HLV123456,"I‚Äôve had 2 gold oura rings ‚Ä¶ love the ring , the look , love watching my sleep ‚Ä¶ but the appearance of the shine that‚Äôs gone away , the tarnish of the gold - the amount of money I‚Äôve spent - not good  The company does not guarantee anything due to appearance- so shop mindfully"
2,Jvcostantini,You need to expect to buy a whole new ring within 12-18 months. Not sure how many people have $300 lying around to do that.
1,Da Jay Rod,This was a really cool ring until a couple weeks ago when the app stopped working.  It crashes every time I try to open it.  The ring is effectively useless without the app.
5,SpillyMcDeez,An amazing ring and app. Have improved my sleep greatly since I‚Äôve gotten it.
1,GHG41,Not once since either update - even after updating to most recent iOS version. No way to submit a customer service issue. Only able to search for‚Äùhelp‚Äù.
5,chicagobenz,Effortless tracking.  I do not even notice the ring and battery life is great.
5,Bryan07,"Great app. Please add a home screen widget like the one whoop has, showing recovery vs activity, possibly HRV."
4,clpsj,I wish I could look at the variation at different points in time. The charts do not provide that currently
1,haycharjay,New update is crashing and won‚Äôt let me view any of my data. This is far too expensive to be crashing every time I click something within the app.
1,Just switch to twitter,Please have it auto sync without forcing me to launch the app. I‚Äôd much rather have a new sleep score come as a push notification after it‚Äôs analyzed I‚Äôm on my phone and clearly awake.
5,chmkeller,Simply the best sleep tracker. Motivates me to take control on my health and live a better life.
5,stev emr,Very easy app with tons of info all from a very small ring.
3,dpupkov,Recently updated UI with lower information density is a disaster. You have to scroll a lot up and down.
5,ader,I love my Oura Ring. Helps me listen to my body when I really want to burn the candle at both ends.
3,tarappi,Product is good but if you have issues customer service is quite bad
3,HARDBODY NEWS,Some of the new updates (July 2022) are causing it to crash and not open.
1,Rumseyda,I paid a lot for my ring and have to pay a monthly subscription for it and the data that shows up in the app is inaccurate.
1,barely ok for ipod,Play bug you the update and once you update the ring stops working  Warning:: Do not update; too many bugs
2,DaiseyK,I updated this morning and it lost m sleep data from last night
2,Debbieski,I have commented below.  They updated the app but it still does not work with the latest IOS version.  It has been over a week since 16 was released!!!!!  Hey your act together!
2,TasteeBanana,Oura Ring and app are awesome and full of data when running properly but after latest update the app doesn‚Äôt even open. Please fix!!
2,Hmntthm,The app is missing a quick scan view. All the tabs are too long form too. I‚Äôd be more engaged if there was a widget to review before the tap in.
1,Flash Co.,App has worked in months past and it keeps crashing every time I try to open the app. Even tried restarting my phone and still not working.
5,Rasalibre,I just keep dialing in a healthier and healthier life every day
3,maphan,First you removed pretty much all meditation flows for gen-2. And the unguided meditation flow appeared to be broken. The sounds simply do not play during the session.
1,George6616,"It was a great App until a few days ago. It keeps crashing on my iPhone Xs with latest iOS. I can't delete it and reinstall it because it will delete all my data as well, so please fix it ASAP!"
1,LawlessGear,They force you to enter your credit card information in order to get the One month free trail with your purchase. And it‚Äôs one free trail per account. You don‚Äôt get another free month if you purchase a new ring.
2,Chodebag,What have you done! The UI on this most recent update isn‚Äôt value added. The old version was much better.
2,Chris664518,Replaced one faulty ring. Then the service went subscription only (not as originally advertised).
1,JayMuzik,I am sick of the app not working. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall the app 3-4 times a week just to get my data. It‚Äôs becoming a hassle. Can you please fix this?
1,aynrant,Every single time I tried to open the app it would just crash. Unable to sync (there was nothing to sync); lost 4 days worth of data
5,Yulia490,Best product! The best customer service I‚Äôve ever had!  Thank you Oura Team!
3,smokeisle,"Hi,  I cannot open Oura app after my phone gets upgraded."
2,desertDaddy,I love this product. I‚Äôm a health nut and this is a great compliment. I just upgraded my iPhone and I can‚Äôt get the app on my new phone or my data to save my life. This is literally ridiculous!!
1,j.mosin,The app no longer opens after yesterday‚Äôs update! I tap it and the logo comes up then everything immediately crashes. Super frustrating! Please fix!!
1,Mike Ton,Wow in one of the most consumer hostile move I have experienced Oura has removed guided meditation feature for existing Gen 2 users  It's a feature I use daily  And are incredibly disappointed by this decision
4,P135675468,Recent update stop the end of meditation chime from working.  Please fix. All else is good.
1,DempseySF,I loved my oura ring but can‚Äôt use it as the app no longer works. The attempted patch did not either.   Expensive toy when not working. Please fix your app and get an update on the App Store.   Thanks
2,Elen.Kr.,"Guys I really love ur ring! But the new update for the app is terrible. It became so big. Before was compact, easy and fast to see all the parameters. Please change it back to the old version."
1,Lillsters,Can‚Äôt comment on the app because I can‚Äôt get support to respond. Trying to get a refund on purchase but they are unresponsive. This company feels like a sham based on this experience.  Be cautious if you need service.
1,urbs_,"Ring works OK, but the latest firmware update prevents the ring from syncing with the app. I‚Äôve used Oura since 2017, and the quality control/app updates have been lacking and gone downhill this year."
3,LizV.,Please fix this issue ASAP. Send a report in the app and still waiting for an answer. Thanks
1,Amaliknyc,"I keep sending emails and tried to get my issue resolved through their chat bot, since you can't talk to a human, but I am not getting anywhere"
5,stephcoop,So glad I have this tool to track my sleep . It helps me guide my activities!
2,Hitticgjft,Where is the app update with the interface? I don‚Äôt see any new tabs - another disappointing update from oura. The app such potential - really a bummer!!
3,Theroffness,How come i am not seeing the simplified 3 tabs? i‚Äôm still seeing the old version with 5 menu tabs.
2,"Mr. ""CB""",Getting close to our return time and not happy with charge duration of the ring. No where near 5-7days. Maybe 3 days to 30% from 100%.
1,Happiness seeker 123,"It only syncs my info about half of the time nowadays. So I‚Äôm only getting 3 or 4 days of data every week. The others just show completely blank with no HR, sleep tracking, etc."
1,starrinlauren20,Can‚Äôt do much outside what an Apple Watch can provide despite having way more data. The tags are messy and don‚Äôt do anything. Really needs an update for pregnant people too.
1,TLenczuk,My ring was amazing but a few months back the battery life rapidly declined. I‚Äôm getting less than a single day of operating time despite turning off the SPo2 sensor. This isn‚Äôt what I was sold... Please help with a firmware update!
1,dawn14325678,"The app spontaneously stopped opening/working. Oura has no solution. The app IS the product.  Without the app, the ring is just a piece of plastic. Total waste!  Use an Apple Watch instead!"
1,iSANAN,"So the latest update doesn‚Äôt really let me open the app it opens and immediately closes, So I basically have a dead ring because of the app not working"
1,Bogey 3025,"Purchased both generations, however generation 3 NEVER SHIPPED AND I never received the refund promised..tons of emails promising 3 to 4 business days for my refund‚Ä¶ that was almost a month ago!!!  No customer contact at all!!!!!"
5,tobyritenour,"Great sturdy product, data is very useful, comfort is great, great ring too!!! Great product for my lifestyle."
3,Alina@shanghai,"The software is insightful. But, the battery life only last one day now..."
5,lgreyes,Love my ring and all the great information that comes with the app
5,boxerbailey,Best wellness app I‚Äôve used. Especially love that it is positive and encouraging with useful info.
2,raninor,After a number of attempts my phone app will not update. No help from Oura. No problem for my wife to update with her newer phone. Both are iPhones.
5,baferdme,Now captures multiple sleep blocks in 24 hour period.!
4,cc4874,It feels like an advertisement you can‚Äôt exit out of and it interferes with reading the rest of it. üò≠üò≠üò≠the take the ring emoji guy AWAY
1,WsTxFy71,"Since I put my ring in airplane mode for changing (because I read it is recommended in their info page), I haven‚Äôt been able to toggle airplane mode off. My ring is now a brick."
1,Dank162607538,Similar to previous versions - this latest one started freezing/crashing on startup for me today. Had to delete and reinstall.
2,CoolNYker,"App is good‚Ä¶ when it works. Another update- and again, crashes immediately. Leaving two stars until it‚Äôs solved."
5,Diana L.,This ring has helped me immensely on my health journey.
1,islandchamp,"No customer support, terrible app on iPhone, terrible and hard to read on webpage, not accessible for blind users, terrible feedback from anybody at this company!"
1,Venmo stinks!,"Even though I have background usage turned off, it runs all the time in the background and uses all my battery"
4,KimberlyAlexis,Bring back the split times in running!!!!!
1,Bleeding Uterus,There is a bug that cuts the sound (no matter what is playing) every time I open the app.   I am on an IPhone 13 with the latest version of the app.
1,FrumaF,"The app and ring are awesome.  But the ongoing subscription? ü§Æ  Given that new, clinically validated competitors are entering the field with no subscriptions and comparable metrics, if OURA wants to succeed long term, they‚Äôre going to need to up their game in this area.   And I‚Äôd like to see them succeed."
3,inytay - that's tiny in pig latin,I love the ring and the stats but the app runs 100% 24/7. It‚Äôs draining my battery like crazy.
5,JPUnderwood,I love this app and how it helps me to track my sleep!
4,Rina363,"The Oura ring clippy is kinda tacky. Everything is so sleek and sexy, and then there‚Äôs the ring with the eyes ‚Ä¶"
2,Boy-mom-3,It‚Äôs a great ring but I can‚Äôt use it when the app crashes constantly and I lose all my data.
5,30hen801,"The product is great, the app is great, and the company is awesome.  By far best health device I‚Äôve ever owned."
3,Olleman71,"I like the app, but every 2-4 weeks I need to reinstall the app since it starts crash looping. Please fix."
5,nolamesfin,"CW: Mentions of eating disorders and anxiety        So going into using this ring, I was a skeptic to say the least. I have struggled with disordered eating in the past and have been known to get too caught up in numbers. Having friends with trackers, I also knew that was basically how most of them motivated healthy living. However I got the chance to use this for 3 months in a clinical trial at MIT and I was pleasantly disappointed!      It allows you to set the goals that are most important to you, which for me were getting better sleep and feeling less stressed overall. As I was doing it however I realized that these issues I was struggling with were a bit more than I could handle alone and I felt empowered by my data and efforts to seek anti anxiety medication. For the longest time I had made myself out to be pathological and ‚Äòjust‚Äô anxious but using this Oura made me feel empowered to try different techniques and comfortable asking for help when I was not successful.       The Oura also helped me to rest more and try alternate types of workouts that were not as intense. As one of the hardest post ED habits to break and one of my true concerns with fitness trackers, I was very happy to find that it helped me value recovery and rest just as much as activity. I workout today about half as much as I used to and I honestly haven‚Äôt ever felt happier or healthier. Health is about so much more than more burn, more push and I‚Äôm glad I had my Oura, for however brief a time, to remind me that."
3,DelhiRocks,The look went downhill.
1,Ilvojnsff123,"The new iOS update is just awful. Clunky, confusing, and hard to navigate. I loved the minimalistic design of the old version - please bring it back!"
1,Cashdollar,"With the new update for ring 3, ≈çura broke ring 2! My ring 2 is 7 months old and after the update and the firmware update it dies in two days and thinks I‚Äôm sleeping whenever I sit down!"
5,Jajajajahajja nd,Awesome product
5,j1cb,I didn‚Äôt like the wrist band type of monitors this one is awesome.  The depth of the information is amazing and truly monitors my health
3,Jess MK,"I love my Oura ring, but the latest update has made the app very buggy."
1,bloodnok,the ring doesn‚Äôt work during the day so i don‚Äôt wear it. but got sick and was hoping the damned thing could at least show my temperature. nope. plus its tagging was designed by a twonk. once the ring dies it will NOT be replaced
5,mom mills,If you are interested in improving your health and wellness this is an excellent tool to achieve your goals.
1,consciousbot,"Long time oura ring user, I haven‚Äôt been able to use the app since the last update (3-4days ago) because the app keeps crashing :("
1,vasconcj,App keeps crashing after it opens. Happening since last update. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and problem persists. Please fix asap!
1,saiiiiiii93,The new features drain the battery life of the ring. I barely get 3 days. Customer service response was ‚Äúcharge more often‚Äù. The guaranteed life was 4-7 days.
1,jesse.zhou,There is a new screen that is forcing me to sync my data before using the app but it keeps asking me to ‚Äúbegin‚Äù and then silently failing. Can‚Äôt use the app. Please fix?
1,pmcginn,Crashes every time I try to open it. I‚Äôm going to stay awake until there is a new version because I don‚Äôt want to mess up my data. üòÄ
1,Nikitabonitaa,Had to delete the app and lose all my data due to the new update.  It was crashing and not opening :(   Whole point of the ring is your data.
5,jeffineads,"So good! Provides so much insight into things that affect your sleep, heart rate and stress!!! I love it!! Game changer!!!"
3,DC LMN,I‚Äôd like to track my heart rate during activity.  This ring is really ideal for sleep tracking and as a complement to a fitness tracker.  I‚Äôd really love to have one device.
1,ssazza,"Buying this ring is a big risk. If you ever need customer service, you are out of luck. My ring charger failed after 2 months and without it, the ring is finished. Can‚Äôt get a response from any link at Oura, even to buy another charger!"
1,hm12c,"Not sure who redesigned the user interface, but this is probably the most inaccessible app I have ever used. I would rather use another device."
5,CamPursel,"The app was cool before, but the addition of workout detection is so good now!"
1,staypro,They pushed a broken app upgrade 3 or 4 days ago and still no fix. App crashes immediately on trying to open it.
1,Tezis,Can‚Äôt open after the most recent update!!!!!!  They need to fix it asap because without the app this ring is useless.
5,Whoop= Trash,There's simply nothing better !   Ditch your whoop and grab a ring !
4,Teardy22,It‚Äôs an amazing invention. It has helped me with my sleep habits in several ways. I am so impressed with  my Oura ring. It is a good friend. It‚Äôs indistructable and comfortable to wear.
3,Not great on iPhone,It is well known that there are 4 phases of the menstrual cycle although the app only tracks 2? Please fix this.
3,Inocenzia,I have tried everything to download this app.  And my ring arrives today.  Grrrrr.
1,Badison123,"The app asks for Bluetooth access, opens a settings section without the option to do anything related to Bluetooth. I can‚Äôt use the ring at all."
1,Hehxjwbskw,I don‚Äôt know what happened but all of the sudden I can‚Äôt open the app at all. It opens for 2 seconds and then crashes which totally defeats the purpose of the ring!
5,applegenius22,The amount of info provided for my health is amazing
1,GesamtKunstWerkist,"App instacrashes every time I open it. Deleting and redownloading the app got it to work, but as soon as it synced my data, it got back into the always instacrashing state. Phone reboot didn‚Äôt change anything."
5,Shamibbbb,I love this tool It allows me to
1,RelRR,Months and months of poor customer support reviews along with the app crashing making the ring worthless.
1,jonleesg,"Hi Team,  Been using Oura for close to a year. This morning the app can‚Äôt seem to startup and simply crashes every time I re-attempt. I‚Äôve restarted the my phone , reinstalled the app but no change. Please assist"
1,do not buy oura,"If your ring breaks, which it will, you will never speak to a human and they will respond to your emails every other week promising a 14 day response time. Terrible experience."
5,Auti esharp,"Great app, inspires me to take better care of myself"
4,DarrylPurpose,Please let us manually create tags. Thank you. I use the ring obsessively.
3,Ted1953,"I have the latest version installed, I don‚Äôt see any of the 3 new tabs"
3,Ky mountain,I have the ring and enjoy using it. I did not and cannot get the new version of app.
5,ADM1989,Love the continuing innovation and words of encouragement!
5,kkdoyle,By understanding and watching your patterns you can radically improve your health. Raving fan of Oura!
3,Leroy 1027,"This is a good iphone app, but I‚Äôve disabled haptics on my phone but still get them from this app. Please fix!"
2,158Lion,You will have problems and you will NEVER talk to a real person very subpar service. It is a good product overall.
3,frntacee,"Gen 3 ring is not capturing all of my sleep.  The ring is in good shape with no physical defects, but it is not working  as well as older generation rings."
1,v_isible,"Oura, fix your app. The cycle of crashing continues even with the new update. Deleting and reinstalling the app does nothing. I‚Äôm so close to giving up entirely on the product."
1,rparelkar,After the last update my ring doesn‚Äôt connect with the app and also the ring battery discharges within a day. Please fix this issue.
4,Jennerses,"Overall, I am enjoying my Oura ring and what it offers currently. But there is definitely room for improvement.  1. I don‚Äôt understand the stress analysis at all, it seems wildly inaccurate. For instance, while driving over the mountain pass, we were going over an area where the roads were feeling treacherous, and I remember looking at the clock to mark the time, because I knew I was very stressed, and was interested to see what my data said. Well, apparently during that moment in time, the ring marked me as ‚Äúrestored,‚Äù while apparently I was stressed for most of the day otherwise (when I was relaxing in the car or hanging with my kids, feeling zero stress). This has happened on other days, when I do feel stressed, it says I‚Äôm relaxed or restored, and when I‚Äôm relaxed, apparently I‚Äôm stressed.  2. I REALLY wish there was an easier way to add ‚Äútags‚Äù to my day. It‚Äôs always confusing figuring how to get to the place where I can add tags (such as alcohol intake, exercise, etc), and involves many clicks. I wish there was a place from the main screen to do this. 3. The options for recording a workout are VERY limited. Basically walking or running, indoors or outdoors. What if I want it to record a strength training session? Or HIIT, playing tennis, or snowboarding? I wish I could just start a workout, and tag it whatever I want, if those options aren‚Äôt going to be there.  4. Oura really needs to rethink their subscription model. Paying $300+ for the ring (lower end models/colors), then $72 per year for a subscription is a little ridiculous. Right now they have an edge on their product, as there aren‚Äôt yet many good competitors, but that isn‚Äôt going to last for long. Either consider lowering or dropping the monthly fee, or even considering allowing users to purchase a ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù subscription with a one-time fee. There are several up and coming competitors, and I can guarantee you, that once there is another competitor offering the same level of tracking and insights, I absolutely will not hesitate to jump ship to another company that does not charge a monthly fee."
1,JohnZ2Z,"App used to be good a year ago.  It‚Äôs getting buggier as time goes on.  Used to be a fan, but login issues and incorrect sleep time readings are making this a used to be good ring and app  Second weekend in a row loggin doesn‚Äôt work.  I want a refund."
1,guscleo,"Seems like it was a hodgepod of ideas glued together, unintuitive and frustrating to use along with mostly inaccurate data"
5,lizok,Four years in with this product and love it
1,workbetter,App needs to figure out how to resume sleep score after being on phone when I wake up for a bit but then go back to sleep
1,catbreath69,Since update middle of last week the app is unusable as it crashes on startup every time. Another update on Saturday was no fix.   Most infuriating is there is no way to contact support for this product. Only FAQs on their web site. This is an expensive product currently unusable with no way to get support.   I do not recommend this company or app.  IPhone 8 Plus
1,triciaswims,Gen2 operated very well. Gen 3 has kinks to iron out. It no longer tracks data during meditations and doesn‚Äôt pick up some of my work outs. I‚Äôve had 2 replacements already.  I should have kept Gen 2.
3,Super tech experts,I got the gen 4 in is garbage doesn‚Äôt work right in is no  phone number to call Oura I scam
5,Zensport,"As a clinical and sport psychologist, I highly recommend this wearable. Useful for understanding stress on performance."
2,loginwoman,"I‚Äôve always had trouble connecting my Oura ring data to the app, but now it simply will not connect at all."
2,Barbo w,I‚Äôve tried five times to update the software and it won‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong or why it is incompatible.
1,Jaythegay,"The latest update has broken the app‚Ä¶.. again.  It will not open.  Uhhhh I really want to like this ring and app, but they make it so difficult to show it any love!"
3,Karli!!,"can‚Äôt even open the app right now, it quits right away!"
3,Dentalflosstycoon,"This is a sleep tracker, not a fitness tracker or health monitor. The app insights are not particularly useful, and the software is janky, requiring app delete/install and hardware re-pairing all the time."
3,NoName098761,The ring is great but the app but remove the ads.
5,smacko11,Wearing my ring for 15 months and love the data...life changer!
2,zthreescotty,Worked great until the last update and now it isn‚Äôt recognized by Apple Watch.
2,SuperTonker,The rings are cheap and easily damaged. If you have an Apple Watch this device and app are a joke. $6.99 per month for a buggy app that is confused.
1,Alberto DDDDDDDDD,It had always worked before. Now it can‚Äôt start as it immediately crashes.
1,Brian Wong74,App crashes and never works since last update one week
1,Amranese,"There should be a way to input my own bedtime, even since I switched up my sleep pattern the ring got confused for some reason and thinks I‚Äôm awake when I‚Äôm asleep and vice versa, and the numbers are all messed up as a consequence and it‚Äôs useless now."
1,Sbow81,Where is the new platform? I‚Äôve updated it twice and still it‚Äôs exactly the same as before.
1,DesfluraneGas,Got this ring as a gift. It will not let you use the app unless you put in your credit card information. Returning the ring..
5,HotYogaGrl,Changed my whole approach wellness. Sleep is everything! Im so looking forward to Oura 3.
1,Yotam Benami,"It regularly misses all of my naps, which are captured by my Apple Watch. This is literally the one thing this ring is supposed to do. Overpriced and absurdly unfit for market."
1,TessaM66,The app refuses to update and wheel to load just keeps spinning now. It‚Äôs been days. Not sure how to fix this without loosing all my data by deleting and reinstalling.
1,Bobbycat1452,Just got a new one for Christmas and I get to the firmware update section and it won‚Äôt let me update the firmware. Waiting on customer service to get back to me :(

5,Doodle lover 5995,This ring really helps me keep my sleep on track I love it‚Äôs simplicity
1,Crhpr69,"Not happy at all, i paid $400 for the ring and required an app that you have to pay to used it? Seriously?"
1,Turttlebutt,"Purchased March, 2021 - Love the idea of this ring but battery does not last overnight even after being charged twice per day and app stating charge is full."
1,wcbjmx,"It is fine when it works, but the newest update will not open for me."
1,Chocodoodle,Same issue as others. Crashes in opening. Don‚Äôt want to lose my data and reset

1,AlinDragosB,Are there any issues with the current version and iOS 15.5 or 15.6 Beta? Is crashing in both versions of the iOS and with the latest version of thr Oura‚Ä¶.
1,Tangatoo,I have had my ring for a few months and I love it. My wish is that the data from my ring could down load to with Myfitness Pal.
3,ÂëµÂëµÂ∞±‰∏ÄÊµÅÊ∞ìËΩØ‰ª∂,I love the color and design of the old version. Why the fonts changed and colors getting uglier... Don‚Äôt get it.
1,kutyatar22,Upon updating it removes previous days data. I am so unhappy. How can I rely on the accuracy of summaries?? Does not worth the money!  Needs lot of improvement.
1,Open to suggestions . . .,Cursed since I updated my iPhone to the new iOS update.  No luck deleting and reloading the app to get it to work.  Will there be a app update to solve this issue?
1,Eddieggg,Oura has no customer service if you have an issue or problem no one will help you by email.   The phone number listed for them is disconnected!

1,MaximilianArturu,"Orders mixed up. Bad product support when the battery just doesn‚Äôt hold a charge. Support team doesn‚Äôt respond. Shame, beware."
1,Lucky4car,The latest update is poorly designed without thought for UX design.
1,JacksonPotts,"I preordered the oura ring way back when, and hate subscription model they have moved too. $300 for a ring PLUS needing a pricy subscription is dastardly."
3,GAArch,"I enjoyed my ring. I bought one for myself and my wife. The insights are helpful as long as you are not using the data from it alone. The calorie burn numbers were about 25% low when compared to what my Polar H10 measured for workouts. Further, I would get sleep scores on nights that I wasn‚Äôt wearing the ring, which were concerning, but not a deal breaker(for me at least). Again, if the readings from the ring supplement your own intuition (As in ‚ÄúThat was a good night‚Äôs sleep‚Äù or ‚ÄúI woke up feeling tired‚Äù) then it can be helpful to put numbers to your intuition. However, I would not use data from the ring to override your own feelings because if the ring gives me data when I am not even wearing it, I am not sure it should be the sole source you use. To me bad data is worse than no data because it can sometimes encourage you to ignore what you ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt. Also, be very careful when deciding what size to get. I was told by Oura to make sure it was snug so the sensors would make good contact. I listened and unfortunately the constant removal necessary for showers (I was also told that it shouldn‚Äôt be worn when showering or bathing) and charging caused a sore on my knuckle from the ring that made removal extremely painful. I am in my 50s and my joints do sometimes swell and if yours do as well, I would not recommend listening to Oura about sizing, because when I approached them about an exchange for a bigger size they told me after 30 days, no exchange. All they offered me was $30 off of a new one. So, my fancy ring is now sitting in the drawer. I am sure my issues are not terribly common but if you have similar joint issues you should definitely be cautious because Oura‚Äôs policy is most definitely ‚Äúcaveat emptor.‚Äù"
1,Tool 49,Nothing changed. The membership I believe is a gimmick. Nice carrot and stick though. Really suckered me into buying this. And where is the Spo2 monitor???? The only reason I upgraded.
1,nalennon,"Since the last update, app crashes immediately! Love the product but please fix ASAP! iPhone XR"
3,Low Tech Grandma,"I can't really complain, because the ring is clearly designed for athletes, but they do not make it clear that it is pretty much useless for anyone else. I'd been looking at the ring website for at least a year because I'm a lifelong insomniac. Then my husband died in July and I just stopped sleeping at night, so I got it. I've had Fitbits before but they always died completely within a year, so I thought a ring would be better. I couldn't really exercise when I was a 24/7 caregiver, and I am a grandma, so I'm not physically ready for serious training yet. Right now I just want to get some sleep, and I walk my dog or get in the pool for an hour or most days. (I still pay a dog walker, so she is not neglected.) All that to say, I sit a lot. I'm taking an online class, reading a lot, crocheting a lot, and watching TV and playing video games on my iPad more than I should. I know that is TMI about me, but I feel like the ring is judging me and I guess this is my only chance to lash out. THE POINT is that I don't see how playing clash of clans, mostly using my non-ring hand, can equal any amount of REM sleep, or how being engrossed in a novel, no matter how lazily, can be deep sleep. If it only called it light sleep, maybe. Last night when I started to bed at 12:30, the ring said it was ""waiting for sleep data."" I knew that meant it thought I had been asleep so I waited for it to finish so I could tell the app that I had not been asleep. After wasting half an hour disconnecting and reconnecting bluetooth, putting the ring on the charger, restarting the app, and watching the download line go across the screen several times, I finally decided that it was waiting for data from sleep that it believed I was still experiencing, so I gave up. Sure enough, this morning it told me I had been through several sleep stages in the 4 hours that I had been watching TV, playing games, playing with my dog, surfing for new crochet patterns, and talking to my mom. Seriously?!"
3,BudgetJoan,"I‚Äôve been trying to sleep better and decided to get this ring for two reasons. First, I don‚Äôt like wearing bracelets and did well with the test for size rings. Second, this was rated high for sleep measurement. I‚Äôve had this ring since 2018. I‚Äôve worn it and 2 other wearables at a time to test it. They all came in close. I like that I can see my temperature go up and try to head off illness. I like the suggestions as to why I didn‚Äôt sleep well. What I never liked is the short battery life. At first I could go 2 days without charging it. Then it became 1 day. It‚Äôs so disappointing when I look to see my sleep and I get nothing. I was going to stop wearing it and try to get used to my Garmin, but was asked to participate in a COVID survey. Im really diligent about checking it every morning. So I participated and then participated again. That was pretty interesting as they sent me for antibody testing too, but I digress. I loved the ring and recommended it to multiple people for the insights and suggestions in timing for bed. You can easily see how a late meal impacts sleep or good habits impact it. I never liked that when I wake up at night and stay awake, it doesn‚Äôt grab my sleep afterward. The new nap addition sometimes gets it. The daily charging though is too much for me. I‚Äôm on vacation and fully charged it the night before last. I checked it last night and it was 3/4 charged after a bit on the charger. I didn‚Äôt check it in the morning, so once I did much later, the battery was dead and I got no data. If the battery dies no data is received. After all that, if the new rings have better batteries and you can‚Äôt wear bracelets at night, this is a good option. I will wear mine periodically to see how I‚Äôm doing. But battery life is very important to me. I also like that it now asks you about your exercise and to confirm it. Oura is continuously improving things with the new releases. But I‚Äôve had enough with charging the battery."

1,Lil‚Äô Mike,"Won‚Äôt let me sign in just crashes I redownloaded several times, nothing works, on iOS 13"
2,Lentiggini1,"UPDATE: Every time my battery gets to just under halfway and I don‚Äôt notice and go to bed, I wake up without insights and without temperature to sync Natural Cycles. Just woke up to another morning of this happening and I‚Äôm so tired of this. As soon as RingConn has consistent temperature tracking I‚Äôm making the switch. Buy, Oura won‚Äôt miss your subscription fee either.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: When I first got the ring I was so impressed. And I got it specifically for temperature tracking for my cycle and it synced with Natural Cycles flawlessly. With the addition of new features like stress tracking my battery has diminished. It used to last almost 7 days, now it barely lasts 4. As a frequent weekend traveler this is a huge pain as I now have to bring my charger everywhere (which is scary because if you lose it it‚Äôs very expensive to replace, not like a phone charger). Even worse, if I charge it fully in the morning, we‚Äôll get to day 4 and I‚Äôll have almost half a battery left. Then it dwindles so quickly on the fourth day it won‚Äôt last the night and I won‚Äôt have temperature data which is the entire reason I have it. The ring does warn you to charge your ring before going to sleep but only if you check the app and it hits below the 25% left threshold. On the fourth day as I said it diminishes but won‚Äôt reach that threshold until after 10pm when I‚Äôm in bed and no longer checking the app. So if it doesn‚Äôt occur to me to charge (which I do have things to think about besides the charge level of my ring to the shock of Oura support) I am without the data that I even have the ring for. I have reached out to support a couple times about this and they‚Äôve been frankly condescending and will ‚Äútake my concerns into account‚Äù type of responses. For a very expensive product and to pay a monthly fee on top of that and then to not get the very data which is the reason I even have the ring is extremely frustrating. I used to sing the praises of the product from every rooftop to literally everyone but now my frustration has me looking at other options."

5,J Leeds,Very pleased with the app and Oura ring. Highly recommended!
1,Trrreeeyyy,I am a fan of Oura but the current update of the app has it crashing as it opens.
5,Antigone213,"Being a dedicated Apple Watch user, this was a big leap for me. I am SO glad I did! The ring itself was a bit pricey but within the range of other health trackers. Being able to wear it 24/7 even in water or during periods of heavy sweat is a plus, and it‚Äôs very comfortable (and stylish‚ÄîI get compliments all the time!).  Coming from Apple Watch/workout app, this app takes a bit of a learning curve to navigate. But that‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs different‚Äîonce you become accustomed to this interface it‚Äôs actually far easier! The dashboard does a great job of showing your daily overview easily, finding specific details takes a bit of exploring but once you use it for a week or two, it becomes easy to find any info you want. It‚Äôs very well organized and simple to use and navigate.   It does everything Apple Watch does (but with more ease and accuracy)‚Äîeven tracking routes during walks/runs! I absolutely LOVE that it detects sleep and workouts automatically without me having to set anything, and I can manually add or adjust a workout if I need to. The accuracy seems much better than the Watch and I find the sleep tracking better than the SleepWatch app I was using with the watch (third party app).   I also love the breathing and meditation sessions. The subscription (after the trial) is reasonable as well‚Ä¶$6.99 a month but I cancelled the $15/month for my Apple Watch cellular, so for me it‚Äôs half of what I was paying.   The two ‚Äúcons‚Äù‚Äîyou cannot manually add naps. Sometimes my naps are not deep or long enough to trigger the auto detect. I think they are working on this feature though. The second is that some of the graphs are compressed (they have to be to fit a day on the width of the screen). While you can drag a line to give info on specific points, a zoom capability (or at least the ability to rotate the screen to landscape) would be nice.  Other than those two things, which are really minor, this app paired with the ring is absolutely awesome overall! Really robust, full of features, nice interface (and easy to navigate once you explore and acclimate a bit), tells you everything you want to know! If you‚Äôre on the fence about the ring, take the leap!"

2,Egor Panchenko,Aftet latest update app stopped working.
2,No app ad-man,"If the program (app and hardware / ring) work properly, it appears to be almost to good to be true but likely beneficial. However, I never got a chance to experience the functionality and process of discovery that goes along with it. I only possessed the ring for a short period during which time it never functioned properly. **I am VERY disappointed.** I had high hopes for this ring, app and the data it might‚Äôve provided to further my quest to maintain my health. After a month+ of research, living with the plastic sizing kit for a week and subsequent purchase, I received a Heritage/ size 12 / sliver / gen 3 that never worked from the beginning. The most basic and primary functional element of the ring, heartbeat sensing, was for me, WILDLY INACCURATE when compared to other wearables, validated** devices and other gadgets. My Apple Watch Ultra 2, pulse oximeter and two validated blood pressure monitors were all within a beat or two of each other while the Oura ring and app indicated heart rates as much as a 100 percent difference !! Example: If my watch along with the other devices reported a pulse rate of 54, the Oura would often report 109!! The Oura data was never closer than an error of 10-25 %. Obviously this would produce completely invalid daily scores. >>The product was clearly defective.<< The ring was a proper fit. The FAQ, list of articles and the terrible Ollie virtual assistant were absolutely no help but for the most basic of inquiries. And, the main issue for me was that there was/is NO SUPPORT but disingenuous emails that offer hollow apologies. Full disclosure: I‚Äôm sending the ring back (my only luck) within the initial 30 day return window. I never got a resolution and decided against an exchange. I‚Äôm guessing that my situation is the exception but this whole experience for me has been so, so terribly frustrating and truly disappointing. ***I really wanted and needed this program to work for me.*** It appears many people complain about the price of entry and the required subscription but that was never an issue for me. It is apparent to me that this company has work to do if they expect to hold their position in the market. A company can only offer three things to their customers: service, low/fair price and quality; pick two. All three combined is virtually impossible. Nothing will destroy customer loyalty faster than a lack of support (service)."

1,Child of God a.k.a. Ces,"My ex-boyfriend responded way better then this company and he was a terrible communicator! At least my ex would respond when I had a question involving money. I just bought two Gen 3 rings for my mother and I for Mother‚Äôs Day about a month ago. I went to workout one day and noticed during my workout that my ring was gone! When I talked to customer service about what I should do they told me to download a Bluetooth tracker app (that I would have to pay for) to try to find it or purchase another ring with a $50 discount. Mind you I had just spent almost $600 on the previous rings and I also selected the gold option for both rings adding $200 more to my order! All I wanted was a response to my questions about possibly providing in the future a discount or insurance for current customers if a ring is lost or stolen. Also you would think a company like this would be able to make it so that you can add the Oura ring to ‚Äúfind my iPhone‚Äù app for situations like this but it seems to me that they are just a bunch of scammers who don‚Äôt give two ‚ÄúF‚Äôs‚Äù about their customer's satifaction. It‚Äôs been about a week now and they closed out one of my inquiries without any kind of answer and left the other unanswered but still open. I‚Äôm going to keep trying because I need answers. Also my mother still has her ring and I want to make sure that if this happens again that I can do something to solve this problem. I would‚Äôve been satisfied with a response of telling me that I would have to buy another ring but at least pay half price because $50 off when I‚Äôve spent $400 already is insane! If they had just answered my other questions that would‚Äôve been a good solution also but silence, sadness, and anger is all I‚Äôm left with. I like the product but I can‚Äôt support a company who cares nothing about their customers. That fact alone makes the company and the product complete trash!"
5,ssusanh_64,"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT‚Ä¶ Oura ring is the best sleep tracker. I wear 3 different trackers because each has strengths in different areas. Wearing all 3 may seem like overkill, however after you pass out in front of your coworkers on a Teams call and end up in the ER, and the root cause was severe sleep deprivation, 3 trackers seems like a proactive approach. Not to mention that I‚Äôll be 60 in a few months with other issues that benefit from the other trackers. I read a lot about the Oura ring and while it‚Äôs expensive, I‚Äôd rather have an Oura ring than another trip to the ER! The second generation Oura ring that I bought is the most accurate sleep tracker compared to Fitbit and Apple Watch‚Äôs Health app. No one can tell that it‚Äôs a fitness tracker! I wear a lot of jewelry, none of which is costume jewelry or even sterling silver. Since I buy jewelry in India, the gold ring just fit right in with my jewelry family. The sleep tracking is SO much more accurate. It catches your naps, when I fall asleep, all of my sleep cycles, and gives me a readiness report which does accurately coincide with what I can handle for the day. Buying this ring was definitely a smart move! If Oura came out with a third generation that has some tiny little gemstones like 3 to 5 little diamonds across the top of the ring, or a combination of gemstones, fully customizable where including the number and type of gemstones you would like on your ring, I‚Äôd be first in line to order. Fabulous functionality and beauty would sell very well, in my opinion. as long as the price point didn‚Äôt increase dramatically. I love Oura. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,wolf.moon10,The app is not intuitive at all. Very confusing. Please work on adding more insights into women‚Äôs cycles.
1,mailjin,App doesn‚Äôt even open post update.
1,Patrick Amar,"I have to say, this was the worst purchasing decision I‚Äôve made in a long time. First off, getting the ring itself was a terrible experience. Fit differently than the sizing kit, and I missed the return deadline by 2 days (for very good reason) and I hoped they‚Äôd be understanding, but they were the opposite. Wouldn‚Äôt even let me exchange for a smaller size (even though it fit differently than the sizing kit).  But of course this review is about the app, which itself was really frustrating to use. Trying to even read your own sleep data from TODAY is shockingly hard. Every time you click on something expecting a detail view, it actually gives you a higher level view. There IS no detail. The ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù measure just didn‚Äôt really make any sense. ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù was useless because I have to take the ring off when I go to the gym. If you want to make any notes/tag things and try to analyze trends, forget about it. The ring often takes a while to connect, and so you can‚Äôt just quickly tap on to see your scores in the morning. You have to wait while it connects and then calculates them.  I did think the meditation stuff was a good idea and a good place to expand for them and try to add more value to justify the added $6/month, but‚Ä¶ overall with this experience‚Ä¶ having just reached the 6 month mark myself, (which is all the free subscription they give you) I couldn‚Äôt wait to cancel. Don‚Äôt make the mistake I did. I reeeeally wanted to like this product, but it turned out to be a huge mistake. It‚Äôs not just that they‚Äôre behind their competitors‚Ä¶ this product wasn‚Äôt even usable IMO :("
1,Moedawg99,Giving up for now. Fire your dev team.
3,lfint00,"I‚Äôve been using Oura ring and the app for over a year. I think the tracking is great and love the differentiation between REM, light, and deep sleep. I do move a lot at night, that I know, and the recent addition of the movement tracking has been a helpful confirmation of this. Additionally it shows heart rate variability, which as a person with heart history and stress, is something that I am very interested in tracking. I‚Äôve recommended Oura to friends who have the desire to see how much REM and Deep sleep they are getting. On the negative side, there is no ability to edit the data. If I‚Äôm in REM and my heart rate gets too high, it says that I‚Äôm awake, even without significant motion. It would be nice to see the heart rate, sleep stages, and motion graphs all in a single graph with multiple lines. Also, if I‚Äôm in bed and asleep by 10 pm but then wake up for several hours in the middle of the night (say 2am-5am), it uses 5am as my fall-asleep time. This results in a record of only 3 or so hours of sleep. Occasionally it records the first bout of sleep (10 pm-2am) as a nap, but not always. If it does, I can at least manually add that time into the Apple Health app to get an overall sleep time. I‚Äôve used Fitbit in the past and you can adjust your sleep times which will trigger that app to recalculate your sleep, wake, rem, etc. That would be a nice feature to add to Oura, especially for the price. Additionally, since COVID, I‚Äôve had a constant banner across the top asking to use my temperature for a study. I do not agree with the privacy policy of this study and have declined to join, but the banner remains. If I do come down with COVID and decide to join the study, my data is stored in the app, so I don‚Äôt understand why the study request can‚Äôt just be moved to the Profile or communication screen where I could opt-in at a later time."

1,TeslaPMan,Newest update starts Data Synch and just crashes over and over. DO NOT UPGRADE
2,Awesome Jester,"Over 3 years of history with my Oura, now relative to a Whoop and an Apple Watch. The one consistent folly with Oura is its over-hyped sleep tracking. It‚Äôs definitely no somnigram and it‚Äôs barely a sufficient sleep tracker. If you get up to urinate at night, or go to bed at inconsistent times due to schedule constraints, the ring will basically perceive that you‚Äôre getting no actual sleep at all. Countless times I‚Äôll wake up from a 7 hour sleep session and it will say I‚Äôve had half that, despite feeling well and otherwise being ready for a productive day. It‚Äôs measurements of REM and Deep sleep cycles is an absolute hogwash joke. According to Oura, I run on 15-20 minutes of deep sleep a night, which is absolutely ridiculous. I suspect the issue is with its sensors and its software algorithms applying expected patterns to all users based on a flawed population dataset of a certain type of sleeper. Because if you tend to be restless, or you don‚Äôt sleep at very specifically consistent schedules everyday, it will fail to register your actual sleep. I can guarantee that across my experience and many others who I know have seen the same data flaws. The HRV and Resting HR features with body temperature are the only reliably useful elements, but you get a much better product and format from the Whoop strap. If you‚Äôre an athlete and want legitimate reliable data for monitoring your recovery profile as you train, you want the Whoop strap, hands down. If you‚Äôre simply a curious person looking for a gimmicky gadget that makes you appear health conscious, you go with Oura.  UPDATE:  APP is continually crashing and failing to load at all, rendering the entire product useless.  The instructions to uninstall and reinstall on IOS don‚Äôt work either.  Total rip off."

1,GlitterGoddess,"I want to like this app. I want this app to be useful. What I found, consistently, over years, is it‚Äôs often a piece of trash. Now, when I say that, I don‚Äôt mean that it doesn‚Äôt provide useful information because there is some useful data that you get. And, if you were a normal person who keeps a normal schedule, I‚Äôm sure the date that they have is more useful for you than it is for me. But as someone who has a night schedule I find the way they collect the sleep information and the way they decide to organize it without any consideration for what I want to do and how I want to manage when my day starts and ends is particularly challenging. How do you spoken with support about this and they keep saying that features will be coming but, despite every feature that has come, nothing has helped with this problem from my perspective. There‚Äôs no flexibility in the app for people who want to have an alternate sleep schedule. And that‚Äôs very unhelpful to somebody who intentionally has an alternate sleep schedule. But, that pales in comparison to the fact that the app continually fails on a regular basis. What I mean by that is I‚Äôll open the app, and then the app will just crash (not even open) and I will be brought back to my home screen. I tried to restart the app and it still happens. I tried to swipe up and stop the app before restarting it and it still happens. I do a reset on my phone and it still happens. And I have to regularly uninstall and reinstall the app to use it. Even if the data was the data I wanted in the organization that I was seeking, it still has this massive flaw that is frustrating beyond measure. Every time there‚Äôs an update it happens. And it seems to happen intermittently for no reason. I have no idea why."

2,kenz1114,"As soon as they fix this issue, this app will get 5 stars. It‚Äôs beautifully designed, incredibly stable, full of great information. It currently has just one flaw, but it‚Äôs a huge one. The readiness algorithm is designed for men. It doesn‚Äôt take into account cyclical hormonal changes to resting heart rate, respiration, and body temp so if you‚Äôre a woman using this, it‚Äôs just a very expensive period tracker. It will give you a great readiness score when you‚Äôre pmsing and on your period (which, of course, is when you feel like garbage) and tell you that you need to rest and recharge every time you ovulate (which is when you‚Äôre actually feeling fantastic and ready to smash training records). The activity goal is set based on the readiness score so it‚Äôs also completely out of whack. These guys are great designers so I‚Äôm sure it would be no problem to apply a seasonality coefficient to create a non linear baseline for these stats which will give women an appropriate readiness score and activity goal for where they are in their cycle. I talked to their support about it and they were super helpful (also deserve 5 stars) and explained that my assumption was correct and it doesn‚Äôt take this into account and he would pass it along to the developers, so fingers crossed that it‚Äôs under way and I can come back and give the app the rave 5 star review it ultimately deserves. But until then, every time I wake up tired and angry from pms/period and see the cheery ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ready to take on the world, let‚Äôs double your move goal!‚Äù I will continue to want to smash the ring to pieces and I will continue to publicly point out the massive flaw in their algorithm."

1,tea spirit,V4.7.5 broken on iOS 16.1 Crashes on launch. Useless‚Ä¶
1,Itinj24,"Needed a replacement wedding band so went with the Balance Diamond model as dual purpose wedding band and health tracker. First off, the initial ring I received had inaccurate, erratic battery charge level readings in the app. Would jump as much as ten percent up or down if I placed it on the charger. ≈åura replaced it on warranty. Great! Warranty replacement exhibited the same behavior. Kind of difficult trying to follow battery preservation guidelines when the app has sync issues and isn‚Äôt showing accurate battery levels. Next, the warranty replacement wouldn‚Äôt show 100% until I took it off the charger. Would only reach 99%. Took it off the charger, then shows 100%.   Several iPhone hard reboots and force closing the app did nothing. So I did what any logical troubleshooting would call for. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Huge mistake. Now app will not open for anything. I enter my login, allow permissions, get to my bio info and hit enter and the app crashes. Try opening again and just keeps crashing on launch. Tried deleting app, health data, reboots etc‚Ä¶ CRASH! Haven‚Äôt heard from Support in three days so it‚Äôs going back while I‚Äôm still in the return period. Unacceptable for a $999 device and not going to chance keeping it in hopes of an app update.  Extremely disappointed and frustrated.  Edit- (In response)- Already sent several screen recordings to ≈åura support via email showing my issue. You know what David told me?  He told me this is a known bug and there‚Äôs a workaround to my issue but won‚Äôt release it to me unless I agree to keep the Ring and not return it.  Excellent customer service!!!  SMH‚Ä¶"

2,Spsulli,"I have had my ring for 4 months. I‚Äôve seen no improvements (or change) to my goals despise exceeding their goal every single day and despite my goal being set to ‚Äúimprove my health‚Äù whatever that means. I‚Äôve also see no change or improvement in sleep despite following all their prompts.   It has a thermometer built in, but can you ask it to take your temperature? No. It has an O2 monitor, can you ask it to check your O2? No, you can not. I wake up in the morning after an asthma attack and it says my O2 levels were great all night.  When you open the app in the morning it has to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù for 3 mins before you can get your sleep data despite it knowing I haven‚Äôt been asleep for hours.  The app has too many pages and menus and click-throughs, I always forget where some piece of data is supposed to live and have to hunt around for it. The graphs and charts have what feels like 25 different styles (most of which don‚Äôt really seem to be to scale) and the only one that lets you actually dive in and see anything other than a ‚Äútrend‚Äù or average is heart rate.   I was so excited to gain some insight into my body and be able to use it to really improve my health. Instead I got an expensive but cheap feeling ring that collects all my health data without sharing it back to me. I left the review at 2 stars because the hardware seems impressive, it‚Äôs a shame they won‚Äôt let you access its potential.   Instead of spending $300+ on this ring, just get a friend who says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing great sweetie‚Äù even when you‚Äôre not."

2,Shpeegz07,"There are some major fixes that need to happen   1. Make the sleep beta permanent already. The old algorithm says I get like 3 hours of deep and 3 hours of rem which is way too much. The new beta is much more accurate and should be used for our recovery! It‚Äôs time, flip the switch already!   2. The tags really need to be overhauled, go take a look at whoop and check out the insights tab. Would be nice if there was a constantly updating section that shows which tags are benefiting out sleep and recoveries and which are hurting them.   3 activity tracking!!! Just add more options for live hr activities. Let me start a workout for golf, weightlifting, swimming, hiit, yoga, whatever. Show HR zones!!! Give us breakdowns of our health stats during these workouts. You really need to go look at whoop and apple and step up your game for the price you‚Äôre charging.   4. Half sizes. I have a 10 and it‚Äôs slightly too big and slightly too small for my desired fingers. 9.5 would be perfect.   5. You gotta fix your all day heart rate tracking! I think half sizes would help with some of the missing readings but this thing should be trying to capture heart rate more frequently. Allow us to toggle on more frequent readings. We understand battery will be an issue but leave that up to us. I charge when I shower so this isn‚Äôt a huge deal to me.   6. The explore tab needs some lovin. More content should be added frequently   7. Stress monitor using hr and hrv. Again whoop, check ‚Äòem out.   It‚Äôs nice to have a ring for sleeping and the app is well designed with some smart messages. I like the daily move goal changing depending on recovery and I like the insights but there could be so much more done to make this product top notch and we are paying you monthly to continue its progress and really as of late don‚Äôt see much of that. You guys are radio silent on updates and features. You dropped your sleep beta and then just left it. So start talking and start improving or ‚úåüèº"

3,AppleUpdatesCompatibilySucks,"After comparing data across devices (and seeing lots of large discrepancies) and then reading / watching about a few scientific studies, I do not really trust Oura‚Äôs data quality.. b/c measuring sleep w/o actual EEG but mostly based on the accelerometer is usually simply quite inaccurate.   The design of the app is really awesome though - definitely an example of great user experience for displaying so much data in intuitive ways.. wish there was Dreem-like device with an app similar to Oura‚Äôs. Ended up getting Dreem - which has the opposite problem - great device and much better data quality (uses actual EEG and more) but the app is much worse than Oura‚Äôs :)  Also, one of the reasons i pretty much stopped using Oura app is the ‚Äúreadiness score‚Äù and ‚Äúsleep score‚Äù. At first, these seem like great ideas and simple metrics that tell you the key things... :) However, as covered above, Oura‚Äôs data quality is very questionable (look at some articles / studies - it often is even less accurate then Fitbit, which is a fitness focus and not sleep focused device). Then sometimes I feel great in the morning, check the app, and the readiness score is good - which is fine. Other days, i may feel fine in the morning, check the app, and then it shows me a poor readiness (or sleep) score, which, by the power of suggestion basically tells me I should be feeling worse / poorly, which actually starts happening! (B/c placebo and confirmation bias / self fulfilling prophecy stuff really works.) Devices should not tell users ‚Äúhow to feel‚Äù :)"
1,Baekgu Sun,"Sometimes, an update is needed. Other times, not. Unfortunately, it seems Oura has gone the route of Apple and decided to ‚Äúmake things better‚Äù with their app but the end result is quite the opposite: it is crowded and stressful, full of complications that cannot be turned off.  First, to be clear, I am not a power user, as it were. I am only really concerned with 3 things: readiness score, sleep score, and my step count. That‚Äôs it.  Issues: * Two of those are still readily available (readiness, sleep), but the step count has to be dug for either through a drop down or through the new ‚Äúvitals‚Äù collection at the bottom.  * The dropdown which hides thing just makes matters worse because the devs seemed to have forgotten to give the ability to recollect it ‚Äî that is, there is an ‚Äúopen‚Äù but no ‚Äúclose.‚Äù (As a side note on this button: the size makes it incredibly easy to hit a different visual.)  * At the top is a pointless HUD attempt that just crowds the screen, and cannot be turned off. It also goes off the screen. If they were attempting to make this data easy to see, they‚Äôve still added a swipe due to this. So, not sure if this really counts as a HUD anymore as it is simply replicating what is already below. * There is also an added timeline, which per the trend cannot be turned off, that for me is also useless but is there nonetheless.  * The ads, despite this being a paid service, are also still there at the bottom: I don‚Äôt need to be reminded of the referral program 24/7, etc.  None of this would be an issue if we had the ability to pick and choose which visuals we wish to see. Not everyone needs or wants everything ‚Äî nor should they. This is a basic principle of report building.  It‚Äôs really unfortunate to see the app devolve like this. I‚Äôve been using the ring since 2021, but this latest update and the increased cost of the ring is sadly making my family and I look for other options."
1,n0x00,Fix it please
1,Jacob Burger,Only 2
5,hugo valdeviso,Hola üëãüèº excelente servicio
2,Halfblake,"TLDR: There is nothing about my experience with this app or this company so far that justifies a monthly subscription. I have a six month free trial but unless things improve substantially (or they ditch the subscription plan), I‚Äôll be seeking alternatives.   Let‚Äôs start with the good. This ring looks nice and is super comfortable. The sleep data in my limited experience (have had my gen3 ring for a little more than a week) has been fairly accurate as far as I can tell. YMMV, apparently, if other reviews are to be believed.   The Activity tracking is unreliable. For example, I recently wore my ring while playing hockey. Despite my heart rate hitting 140bpm, the app detected no ‚Äúactivity‚Äù and the intensity of my workout was apparently only ‚Äúmedium‚Äù and not ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (though my exhausted body would beg to differ).   More on that note: if bad data gets into the app somehow, you cannot modify or delete it. It just stays forever.   The app does not sync with Apple Health. It just imports data and then keeps it. If you delete that data from Apple Health, it remains in Oura. So don‚Äôt make mistakes, because again, you can‚Äôt modify or delete anything in this app.   This is the single best candidate for an iOS widget that I‚Äôve ever seen and there currently isn‚Äôt any to speak of. This one is mind boggling.   No app shortcuts either, so plan on navigating the app for any logging you‚Äôd like to do. Like adding tags, for example. As long as you‚Äôre selecting one of their pre-made tags, because you can‚Äôt add your own.   I simply don‚Äôt know what the subscription pays for. Is it the 30-40 total media files for meditation and sleep? Which have titles and no descriptions? Insight Timer is totally free and vastly superior in that arena.   Is it my own data? That my $300+ ring collects? I hope not. Would be a shame to have spent money simply on an opportunity to spend more money.   I currently get to know what my heart rate is when I manually ask the app for it, but the active monitoring has been delayed until sometime in 2022 so no word on that yet. Will see if my free trial gets extended to account for the delay of that feature, but customer service is nonexistent so far.   In the end, Oura: if you‚Äôre gonna ask for money every month, you need to be better. Across the board."
1,ajsgfjjanVsyegbxbx,The app does not reflect what‚Äôs shown in screenshots
2,Red84604,"This app was clearly built for men with zero attention to how women are different. I bought it because I heard the designers brag that it is really good at predicting ovulation, but in reality the user has to look at the raw data and figure it out for themselves. So it doesn‚Äôt actually do that thing. Ironically, the main metric of the app is inaccurate for women precisely because it ignores the one thing that supposedly it can predict so well. A woman‚Äôs heart rate increases by an average of 2.5BPM during ovulation, and then another 3.5BPM during the luteal phase, but every day for the past two weeks I have woken up to the app telling me ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù And ‚Äúbetter take it easy today‚Äù because my resting heart rate is higher than average. It knows that I am a woman. It supposedly knows exactly when I ovulated. It should know that this is completely normal. But instead it treats being a woman like being sick. They really need to allow women to track period data so it can evaluate ‚Äúnormal‚Äù against women‚Äôs changing realities during our cycles, instead of some theoretical average based on men. My husband loves his though! :/    UPDATE: The opposite scenario from what I described above is also super annoying. I have been dead sick with the flu for over a week. The app knows that my temperature is elevated by a lot and that my sleep efficiency has been in the 60‚Äôs-low 70% for over a week, but because my resting heart rate went down last night it says I am ‚Äúgoing strong.‚Äù That is inaccurate for someone who pulled a muscle from coughing so violently yesterday! So it thought I was sick when I was fine‚Äîjust because I was in the luteal phase of my cycle and so my RHR was going up, and now that I am actually dead sick it thinks I am doing great just because I am about to ovulate and so my RHR went down. The bottom line is that the readiness index is very strongly influenced by the resting heart rate, but the resting heart rate for a woman varies dramatically during her cycle and the app does not take this into consideration. So the readiness index (the first thing it shows you every morning) is completely useless for a woman. I still do find it useful though to have the raw data on my sleep. Like the others I wish there was more/better data for workouts and also raw data for temperature instead of just the change from average.  UPDATE #2 Well I am now pregnant, and once again the app thinks that I am sick. Yes my heart rate is elevated because my blood volume increased significantly to make a human, but in spite of the fact that I used the ‚Äúpregnant‚Äù tag, every morning I wake up to a message saying ‚Äúyour heart rate was elevated last night. Better skip the gym today.‚Äù That is HORRIBLE advice for a pregnant woman!   Also the sleep tracking just isn‚Äôt very accurate. It thinks I am asleep when I am lying awake staring at a clock. It thinks I am napping when I take the ring off to wash dishes. (If I don‚Äôt take the ring off it thinks I am running a freaking marathon instead of just washing dishes, so that messes up my metrics too.) And even when I reject the map suggestion it still adds it. And there is no way to add a nap when I was in fact asleep.   At the end of the day, when the ring is sitting on the counter and the data shows that I am having REM cycles and deep sleep, it makes me think the thing might be completely useless.   Also my husband has stopped wearing his. It gave him a severe rash on whichever finger he tried. He puts it on to meditate now but that‚Äôs it."
1,FM_M,"UPDATE TO DEVELOPER RESPONSE:   Thanks for replying. I appreciate that you would like data to help you do those things; first, it should be an option not a mandate, and second, conspicuously absent in your reply are things like ‚Äúwe only collect anonymous app-performance data‚Äù or ‚Äúand that‚Äôs the only things we use your data for; we never share or sell your data.‚Äù  While I appreciate that you have strict policies about keeping my personal data safe, the fact of the matter is that, no matter who you are, there‚Äôs always someone cleverer, smarter, or more motivated than you who wants to steal your data. It happens daily, and to big tech corporations too. It could happen to you, despite your policies and your (I‚Äôm sure) good security infrastructure.   The only truly safe way for you to safeguard my data is for you to never have it, and since there‚Äôs no critical need *for me, the customer* to share my personal data to make your product work, this requirement feels spurious and dishonest, and the risk is more than zero while the benefit is zero. Why on earth would I do that?  (FYI, I replied here because you didn‚Äôt give me a direct way to contact your support, and I don‚Äôt have questions beyond ‚Äúcan I buy and use your product without an account and sharing my data?‚Äù - and they‚Äôll just say no.)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ORIGINAL REVIEW:  No really. The ring communicates with this app, right? Closed loop, right there - app talks to ring, ring talks to app, all over Bluetooth (which is very local), integrates with Apple Health if I want it to, and also‚Ä¶ the app needs to then send my data to their servers? I need to have an account, and they want - no, require - permission to ‚Äúprocess my health data‚Äù? Why? Give me a good, honest reason, gang. I can‚Äôt find one, and all that‚Äôs left is unnecessary, undesired privacy intrusion. Your Privacy Policy says you have legitimate grounds for collecting and processing our data, and the very first reason you give is ‚Äúto provide the service.‚Äù If the ring and app are a closed loop processing the data together, and they should be, then how on earth do you need to collect my data to provide the service that is all happening within a few feet of me?? It‚Äôs a shame; the app privacy problems just made me change my mind about buying an Oura ring."

5,girl from jazz traxüíÉüèº,üëåüëç‚ù§Ô∏èlike I saidPRETTY COOL STUFF HERE!!
1,Nin7,"UPDATE: My spouse & I bought rings two weeks apart in the same month. Oura decided to grandfather one ring and make the other one subscription.   The Free version (if you don‚Äôt pay for subscription) is SO crippled that it only shows you a sleep score. A number. Nothing else. Fitbit & others give you full sleep data with no extra costs.  Free version does not allow you to disable the blood oxygen sensor. Left running, this brings battery life to 4 days. (Horrible)  Product review: While the Oura ring hardware is wonderfully compact & wearable, the app itself is fairly useless. Yes, there are graphs & charts and metrics, but they‚Äôre all fairly repetitive across the ‚Äòtabs‚Äô. Insights revolve around the singular theory that humans all sleep at night. (Which is false). Charts, while well laid out, are not dissimilar to FitBit & other trackers. There‚Äôs really nothing new here. Charts offer no way to edit/correct data or tag specific events.(If you wake up in the middle of the night you can‚Äôt tag the event: say ‚Äúcar alarm‚Äù or ‚Äúbarking dog‚Äù). Custom tags don‚Äôt exist (I assume because Oura is collating all user data for their own sleep study?). Lack of custom tagging means the app is useless as a sleep diary. We‚Äôve also found Readiness Scores to be a useless metric that didn‚Äôt correlate, in any way, to how we felt in the morning. Insights were a fairly repetitive set The last tab of the app is populated with a bunch of ‚Äúsleep aid‚Äù sounds. There are many many other apps and hardware devices that provide these. (Many for free. Many are better). So they‚Äôre essentially useless to us. Ultimately it‚Äôs just a fancy wearable that tells you heart rate, temperature & sleep cycles. - Surely NOTHING there justifies a monthly subscription ($75/year) after paying $300 for the ring ??? Personally, we have found that the 8-Sleep pod to be better for not only giving us the same metrics, but also ACTIVELY contributed to better sleep by auto-adjusting the mattress temperature of the bed while we slept. - The ring just tells you how you slept. 8-Sleep does that AND regulates the temperature of your bed so it is optimized for each sleep cycle. - A no brainer. Avoid Oura unless you like throwing your money away every year."
5,Motivated-but-Frustrated.,"I've used this ring and its app for a long time. It works as advertised and I've found no flaws. I'm on my second ring (because I didn't read the manual; yeah, lame, I know) and as soon as I let ≈åURA know about it they sent me a new one. They allowed me to choose a new color (glossy black) and I constantly get inquiries about the color. It looks like polished magnetite, and when they find out it's a computer with highly developed and scientifically valid sleep, activity,  and readiness tracking that follows all those things over time and offers a complete and thorough picture that one can use to get in and stay in optimal health, well, they flip out. And no, I have no skin in the game, I'm just a regular guy from Silicon Valley who is getting in better health every day with the advice this regularly updated ring and app duo give me. Get one, it's a great deal for the price they're asking! One piece of advice: the multiple sizing rings that they will send you are lightweight plastic which will give you a feel for where you want to wear it (try them on different fingers and wear them doing your regular activities) but you have to calculate how your real ring with its different weight will work on your finger; you might need a size smaller. ≈åURA will work with you to get it right!"
1,essan_s,The rollout of the new app to support new clients is severely impacting existing ones.  Since around Nov 20 my workouts (mostly running) and imported from apple health/fitness (as I do not wear the ring when running) have not been registering in a consistent manner vs previously.   Eg a 5km run is being recorded as a low energy activity whereas previously is was high.   A week after submitting a ticket‚Ä¶ no response. I had to reach out via twitter and then got a response. But the suggested short-term workaround is frustratingly unreliable.   Why not rollback to an old version?? Is it because you now need to support feature for new v3 clients? And this is your priority?  I absolutely understand that Oura needs to monetize the research improvements that support existing clients.   I (and I suspect many clients) would support having to pay a monthly subscription and keep the existing device with no interruption in service.  That seems like a no-brainer.  Puzzled why you didn‚Äôt go down this road.   You are leaders in the wearable space and clients like me would gladly support you.   Instead you are giving the impression that you‚Äôve prioritized the acquisition of new clients over the support of existing ones.   I am fighting the urge to connect dots that should not be connected‚Ä¶It seems too coincidental that the rollout of new device and new service happens at the same time as the existing service failing in an important function.  Sorry for the rant. But will happily update this feedback once this is fixed in order to acknowledge your pivot to being more responsive. It‚Äôs been almost a month now.

1,dan17571,THIS PRODUCT IS A SCAM FOLKS
5,Shawn Mccall,"Had it for almost 5 months !Has taken subjectively trying to improve my sleep by trying to feel the the difference when I try new things such as eating dinner  earlier at night or changing sleep position to being able to clearly see when something changes ! Will more than ever make you rethink having a cocktail or two, especially close to bed! And when contacted customer service they were prompt and helpful!"
3,iScypher,"Doesn‚Äôt always record my night‚Äôs sleep. Has just missed two nights in a row. Seems like whatever recurring bug that‚Äôs causing it is getting worse. It‚Äôs always missed at least two nights‚Äô sleep records per month, but not back-to-back like this. I tried to use the in-app contact feature to contact someone about it, but they seem to have removed that feature and replaced it with help articles to search. So that‚Äôs doubly frustrating since I not only can‚Äôt contact them about it, but also, if you‚Äôre only going to offer articles for searching, then rename it so we don‚Äôt waste time trying to figure out to actually send a message like we used to be able to. I‚Äôm disappointed by the sync issues, especially considering how much the ring costs. It‚Äôs great tech, but the random and persistent sync bug that‚Äôs still not been fixed over the past 6 months or so is extremely angering."
2,Seanaziz,"I‚Äôve never left a review of an app before, but the Oura ring and the accompanying app have been particularly disappointing, especially for the cost. I‚Äôve been using my ring and the app for about a month at this point (Sept 20, 2018).  The app cannot be taken out of airplane mode unless you put the ring on the charger. This is inconvenient and contrary to every device I‚Äôve owned. More importantly, the app locks up frequently and has to be restarted.   However, the worst is that the ring now won‚Äôt come out of airplane mode despite following all the troubleshooting guidance. So, my +$300 ring is essentially useless.   Customer service is generally delayed and not always helpful at answering the questions presented. However, they have been courteous and have tried to help out.   The ring also has trouble distinguishing between sleep and periods where you‚Äôre either lying or sitting still (e.g., reading or watching a movie). When the ring does accurately read your behavior, I think that it provides useful data. I do like that it provides guidance on when you should go to sleep based on the HR and HRV data.   I really want to like this ring and app; but so far, it‚Äôs been really disappointing for the money invested."
4,John Hazim,"But the app still has a few bugs. My biggest gripe is with manually entered activities. When the selection for intensity is chosen the app will often seem to assign a random intensity (often higher) which then skews activity data and ultimately the readiness score, etc.  This is frustrating because the accuracy of information in the app is key to reporting accurate trends, make valid suggestions etc.  Otherwise, I love my ring, the design, the app and the info it provides me with (most of the time) are awesome! Looking forward to being able to track meditation HRV in the future update! Thanks OURA"
1,Noraris,"I am an OURA 1 user and when they launched the more efficient and longer lasting OURA 2, I ordered in Dec 2017 and on got my ring in August 2018. It synced for the first few days and then the connection was lost. I have been trying to reconnect via reloading the app and logging in as a different user (hence prepared to lose my Oura 1 stats just to make the work). The help desk asked me to maybe ‚Äútap the ring like am knocking on door‚Äù while I was connecting and still nothing.  I did not only waste the $200 I paid for, lost previous time I can never take back as I have been trying to set up the oura 2 for >30x! I am asking for a replacement if not I want my money back pls. I will just order the competitor VOTIV and move on."
4,hillarycru,"I have been using the Oura app for three days after receiving my new Oura ring and so far love the sleep tracking function and readiness score. One of the main reasons I was looking for a wearable, though, was to more accurately track my daily steps and activity for other apps without having to carry around my phone and it‚Äôs built-in pedometer all day. Unfortunately Oura doesn‚Äôt give me the option to pull over its step count into my health app, even though almost all the other information is available to sync. Please add this capability!"
5,just..say-in,"The ≈åura ring is one of the best sleep and fitness trackers available today. The insights and guidance provided by the app‚Äôs life coach are literally life changing. I used to use a Fitbit Charge HR and this device runs rings around it in terms of ease of use and the information that it shares with the iOS Health app.  If you are looking for a way to improve your health through better sleep and activity habits, you should start using an ≈åura ring as soon as possible."
2,Shinygrrl,"Overall I am very happy with my Oura ring, but I have had to deal with some very glaring glitches with links that kept me from being able to record my data for over a month after I got a new phone, and I had to figure out the flaw, then tell Support what they needed to fix, which was extremely frustrating.  Now that I‚Äôm back on I can‚Äôt find the activity and sleep charts that always used to be one swipe away. If Oura keeps this up it will be useless, but I‚Äôm hoping they figure it out because I do not relish the idea of wearing an ostentatious watch type thing."
4,gnatnat,"The notifications are, I hope, buggy. They wouldn‚Äôt design it to send me notifications every few minutes after an activity on purpose, would they?? The notification tells me I can modify the intensity of my Strava ride, and takes me to a screen where nothing happens. A few minutes later bzzzzz! Another identical notification. I had to turn notifications off, so now I won‚Äôt get notified if the battery is low. I hope they fix this."
5,Luchalibre22,"I‚Äôve tried just about every wearable on the market and the Oura takes the cake. Seriously. I‚Äôm pretty critical when it comes to accuracy, but the Oura hasn‚Äôt let me down yet.  I really like the ‚ÄúReadiness‚Äù feature which distills down the previous day‚Äôs activity and the quality of my sleep into an easy to digest number each morning."
5,hall.ryan,"I Love my oura Ring and apply it‚Äôs data daily. However, since the last update my ring won‚Äôt connect to my phone. I‚Äôve tried all the troubleshooting tips. I am hesitant to forget device and try to find it again, or delete the app. Can somebody help? Anyone else experience this."
1,Julie Skalla,"I want to like this ring.  It was a Christmas gift from my husband.  However it arrived not working right out of the box.  Two days later, it died completely.  Part of the charger actually melted the first time I had my ring charging, indicating a safety problem.  Worst of all, I‚Äôve been emailing customer service With No Reply!  I need the company to contact me immediately or I‚Äôll have to escalate this.  My husband loves his ring and his has worked fine.  But the quality of mine and customer service issues make me question what is going on with this company."
5,Backyardbrewer,"A bit of a learning curve figuring out the various metrics for sleep and readiness and how to make adjustments in behavior. App doesn‚Äôt seem to have capability to print or export data and trends, would make the information more useful and available. But very impressed with capabilities and ease of getting started."
5,forachel,"While the app gives tons of useful info, I'm looking forward to even more data like HRV and temp. being added in future updates. The ring is best at giving sleep and readiness info. I love the help it provides in reminders to avoid sedentary behavior too. Amazing product!"
4,wejeta,"The app for Oura Ring is always a day behind. When you go back to view data for the night before is blank, but you can see data under today. Also the going to bed time is not accurate either.  I have high hopes that the developers will work on these issues. Otherwise, other data  provided is useful."
4,Magic_Now,"The only way to get out of the plane mode is to have the hardware charger present. This presents a major inconvenience when traveling, as otherwise the ring would be good to use for a week without the charger. Please fix this design weakness to enable airplane mode on/off feature on the mobile phone without the charger."
5,umbar,"I have been using Oura for five months and it's the only tracker that I use daily. I gave up Apple Watch, Fitbit and Basis because of their limitations and battery life. Oura battery lasts 4 days and the ring form function makes it easy to wear it 24/7. Highly recommended!"
4,No madness yet for I think,"Great app, but I'm still trying to figure out how nicely it plays with my apple watch relative to the ios health app. Does ios health add the steps and calories counted by my oura ring to the steps and calories counted by my apple watch? Or does it know not to add these duplicate sources together and keep only one?  More documentation would be nice"
5,darkha1f,I waited for months to receive my ring. Thought about cancelling many times... but I stuck it out and am glad I did.  The Oura lives up to the hype. Great metrics and quite accurate. I finally have a reliable way to measure my sleep and recovery.
5,TheVioletsBassPlayer,Long time user. Best general use activity and health monitor. The UI is best in class. The daily reports and advice incredibly helpful (and accurate). I strongly recommend to anyone interested in improving health and cognition.
5,"""Hey Joe""","This device gives valuable facts for anyone of any age who wants to quantify their health.  Sleep, over training, recovery with algorithms the include stats over time periods.  Excellent for athletes & older folks trying to improve sleep."
3,knck,"The app does sync with Apple Health so that means having to remember to add exercises things manually all the time. I‚Äôm also having a lot of annoying bugs, from entire days of data loss, problems in detecting start time for sleep, etc. The ring is really great but the app has long ways to go."
1,swalsh,"This app is horrible.  It doesn't give you real time data, if you charge the ring it erases all of your data...that's when it actually connects with the app (more than 50% of the time you get a ""trying to connect message"")....total waste of money, I should have stuck with my Fitbit.   The ring only works with the app, so the app being horrible speaks for the device itself.  Save your money...this is a total rip off!"
3,F4d3r,If you're not on nocturnal than happen to be out till 3 am & try to update it that next morning (3 am) before you sleep expect the app to totally lose its mind and you lose the day. When I get to a computer will post screenshots. It's ugly. Hopefully they will fix because A+ product otherwise.
5,Scottws2000,This app and ring is fantastic. I am hoping Oura will add a Apple Watch app for a quick view of heart beat and body temperature.
1,stevegclark,I paid $400 for the ring and the app is complete crap. So at least the ring looks nice but it completely worthless since I have no idea what the data is saying.  The app is stuck in ‚Äúwaiting for your sleep data ...‚Äù  I tried contact support but I get a blank page when I click on ‚Äúsend us a message.‚Äù  My next step is to ask for a full refund.
4,MikeLee777,"I bought the Oura ring to track my sleep, so it does an awesome, 5 star job of that, very detailed. I compared it to a sleep study I had at sleep clinic, and seemed very accurate.  I assumed it would track my activities, including heart rate real time, it doesn't yet, which is why I have 4 Stars, guessing they will add functionality with future updates  Ring is comfortable, sizing exercise made sense  Customer service was good when I reached out to them"
1,Xf2007,Compared to my otter wearables this device is WAY off. (By 3 1/2 hours tracking REM and tracks me in REM sleep while walking around fully awake)  After waiting through months of delays on shipping- what a complete disappointment and waste of time and money. Hopefully the refund does not take as long as the shipping did.
2,Josuve,"I got this sensor thinking that it would be far superior to anything in the market. The feedback that you get with the app is much more limited, and less accurate, than what you get with much cheaper devices."
2,Almuoc,I have  had to delete the app at least 3 times since owning the ring. It will not sync with data! A total pain. Customer service is slow to respond at best. I expect more from an expensive tracker like this.
3,musician528,"And updates need to come faster. Customer support is responsive, but seriously, these updates are taking so long."
3,Rich Martin,"This app is great, but this company is far too well established to not have the app be compatible with the iPad. Health tracking is not solely the domain of the phone. Fix this, ≈åura, and I‚Äôll change the rating."
3,Dmitry773,"Love the update and appreciate all the new features, but now it drops my daily activity to zero and its super frustrating:( please fix"
5,HardyFeng,üòÄ
2,Johnny673,"It‚Äôs nice when it works, but sometimes when I wake up and put the ring in the charger to take it out of Airplane Mode it syncs and there is no sleep data from the past night even though I was wearing the ring."
2,theadlee,This is the main reason I bought the ring.  It is supposed to work but it doesn‚Äôt.  Just updated to the latest version.  Still broken.  Time to return.
4,Said AlRiyami,App is great. But I hope to support Apple Watch to show progress and other information
5,Old guy xxx,The one thing I don‚Äôt like is the fact that the ring does not track my steps accurately.  I use a treadmill and a pedometer .  The pedometer tracks my steps to between 5800 - 6200 on average for a 20 minute walk /  trot. The ring may count 1200 1400!
1,swschmidt,Not sure what is going on but the app is absolutely destroying my battery. Currently at 37% of usage with 1 minute onscreen and 6 hours of background activity.  This isn‚Äôt good. Please fix!
3,Mufeez Lebbe,When are we going to have an Apple Watch app? And when we can write write steps data to Apple Health?
1,ClicketyClak,Ordered and confirmed ring size over a month ago. Support won‚Äôt respond with an delivery estimate. Almost ready to cancel and check out motiv.
4,maratonat,"The ring provides excellent sleep tracking and feedback about sleep quality and associated telemetry. Although it‚Äôs not possible to know if the measurements from the ring and the feedback from the app is accurate, after 4 weeks of use, I can say it‚Äôs spot on relative to how I actually feel in the morning and throughout the day. It appears that for now, no tracker on a consumer budget is perfect, but this tracker is clearly really good. Its comfortable after one gets used to wearing it. It‚Äôs very comparable to using AutoSleep with the Apple Watch (I compared the data by wearing both at the same time), but the ring is a whole lot more comfortable and unobtrusive to wear at night, which is why I got it.   The app has an intuitive UI that is well laid out and is easy to navigate and understand. It provides excellent explanations of all the contributing telemetry. However, improvement is badly needed in the area of syncing with Apple Health. Since the app only reads workouts from Apple Health, it misses all other daily activity, be it from Apple Watch or another tracker. If the ring is only worn at night, which might actually be the norm, the app will always miss previous day‚Äôs activity and will continue to nag about insufficient movement. The software should be better geared for use along side with other fitness trackers, such as the excellent Apple Watch.  Unfortunately, for those who occasionally wish to wear the ring during the day along with a conventional watch, lots of telemetry ends up not being synced to Apple Health.  Overall, kudos to the Oura team for creating such a refined combination of hardware and software, but please pay more attention to improving syncing with the underlying OS echo-systems - please add the missing data synced both ways. The product will likely be used together with other fitness trackers, and using the underlying ecosystem such as Apple Health will assure the best and most complete user experience. Also one can only hope that the level of support will improve going forward."
1,S.H.smash,Just got my ring and downloaded the App but it won't open. It keeps crashing when I try to open it.
1,Matthew Pryc,Battery barely lasts 24 hours now. Used to last almost 7 days. Big bummer.
3,ChunkyLover042,The app has a solid foundation.    Navigation is a real drag with swipe functionality the only method and somewhat iffy.   The real bonus would be  integration to Health Kit.   But for an app this complex in its early stages. Well Done

4,John Sherman art,"Well , so far I love my Oura Ring 4! It‚Äôs so much easier to wear compared with Whoop.  Im happy with my sleep reports and can report that when it notes that my readiness is low that indeed I feel rotten from bad sleep  or sickness. It somehow motivates me to do more to take care of myself!  That oxygen sensing/reporting  is very important since I move between 5000 and 10000 feet twice a week. I make sure to sleep with supplemental oxygen at night  Battery is good . Negative: step count is less accurate than Apple Watch.  I‚Äôm glad I purchased the Oura Ring 4! Please add ‚Äúflights climbed ‚Äú measurement!"
1,RZeller92,"The waterproof feature are very nice. The gold ring also looks very nice.  The steps are inaccurate if you work with your hands. In my case charting, typing, and working a the bedside in the hospital. But if you are just walking then yes it will track steps well.   EXCEPT SLEEP any other type of Tracking stops from midnight till 4AM (0000-0400). Because I guess the company thinks who ever can afford a ring works dayshift. I contacted customer support they did nothing for me.   My current problem and reason I am canceling the membership. My ring stopped tracking I was unable to get on my app for a week or so due to personal reason and the ring did not track my sleep or anything. Ring during that time was charged because every few days I charge my watch while I shower. A big reason why people have the ring is to track sleep and I have no current sleep scores.   I reached out to customer support they were making a ticket and the customer service just bombarded me with help links that did not help  A MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP IS NOT WORTH IT."
1,JT5123,"I was excited to see the new 6.0 UI, updated my app ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs exactly the same, nothing like the images. Confirmed it shows as version 6 in app settings. WTH?"
2,ulflei,I have my ring now for over 6 month worked great at the beginning now I have everyday connection problems.If that continues I give the ring back too much aggravation  If the ring works I like it The ring is tight on my finger
1,hsnaras,"I don‚Äôt want a lot of scores so I don‚Äôt want to pay the membership fees. However, something as basic as locating the ring when you lose it should come without membership. When a user is paying $350-450 for this ring, those basic functionalities should be part of the trade."
5,Genuine reviewing thoughts,"So I heard of the Oura ring from Annie Elise on YouTube. She mentions it so often on her channel. I got my ring about a month ago and it has helped me focus more on paying attention to what my body needs. I‚Äôve been getting more sleep taking it easy when it tells me I need to, putting in more physical work when it tells me my body can afford it. It has helped me on losing unwanted weight. I‚Äôm not a super fan about the app charging but for me and my health honestly I feel like it worth it. And I cannot suggest it enough. Thank you Oura (p.s- please reach out to Annie Elise on YouTube if y‚Äôall ever see this. PLEASE! She has a huge following and she really inspired me to look into this ring and buy it she also does a lot for families that are victims in true crime and families in need)"
5,A child from god,"If you're looking for something to track your :  Step Calories  Sleep  Workouts  Oxygen  Heartbeat Then look no further! Not to mention the customer service it's A+. Any questions you might have, they will answer the same business day. You really can't go wrong with this device.100%! Recommended."
1,Nicrom87,"I'm thrilled with the app! However, I feel it could greatly benefit from a dedicated stress-tracking widget. Currently, there's a noticeable absence of such a feature. For me, monitoring stress is vital‚Äîmore so than sleep quality, which I don't need displayed. I'd much rather have instant access to my active heart rate or stress levels on my widget. Additionally, the inability to share my stress data is a limitation. Considering the significant impact of stress on our lives, I believe the app should prioritize stress management tools over static sleep or readiness scores. It would be a valuable enhancement to the user experience.  **Update (5/30/24)     ‚Ä¢ Latest version took away all my widgets.. not sure if this was intended or a bug, but I‚Äôm giving one star to hopefully draw some attention to this issue."
3,ShaneFartik,"I originally got the Oura ring 2 and after a couple years of stopped working, so I got the Oura  ring three. After three months I got a replacement because the sensor broke and I‚Äôve had it for about two years. One day it suddenly stopped connecting to my phone. I tried removing the ring from Bluetooth, but when I turned Bluetooth back on, it was no longer on my iPhone. I tried contacting customer service, but it‚Äôs not existent. I was in contact with a bot which didn‚Äôt solve my problem.they told me I would be contacted by email. I tried following their instructions and that didn‚Äôt work. I tried rebooting my phone and removing the app and logging back in. After my second try the ring reappeared. Apparently there had been some firmware updates and my ring never received them so 30 minutes later my Ring was working after firmware update. Thankfully, I am somewhat computer literate otherwise This never would‚Äôve worked."
2,tom//$$)(,"I just think that this item is pretty expensive to buy to begin with. When you stack a subscription fee on top of that I think it‚Äôs kind of lame. Subscription should be free to barely anything. Also, the ring is kind of a pain in the butt to wear. I end up not using it as much as I thought and then I look at the fee. I pay every month. Probably going to stop my subscription this month."
4,steve.huang,"After upgrade to iOS 17 and WatchOS 10, the Oura Widgets don‚Äôt display. It‚Äôs just blank. Even the latest update as of 9/21/23 on the app that just came out still has this problem."
2,Mynameisnicole!,"I‚Äôve had my ring for two days. While I was initially excited about it, I have determined that this is very bad experience. I reached out to customer care a day and a half ago, regarding the fact that my sleep was not being tracked and I cannot update the firmware. I have gotten no response so far, and I‚Äôm getting ready to send this ring back and get a full refund. I was very excited about it. I have used other trackers and wanted some thing that I did not have to keep on my wrist. However, my experience so far has been very poor."
5,Beachmama50,"I learned about Oura from Brian Johnson, founder of what was then Optimize and now, Heroic.Us my Oura ring helps me move from theory to practice to mastery of getting my best nights sleep by motivating me to bring up that score.

2,the Bonnie brewer,"Everything works great but it keeps saying ""no sleep data from last night"" and won't show me anything about my circadian rhythm even though my husband can see his. I'm on iPhone and he's android, so I'm not sure why I'm having a problem. Everything is ok otherwise."
1,Dobysmom,"I love my gen 3 Oura ring, it helps me determine the level of my workouts every day. But ‚Ä¶ the last 2 updates have really shortened the battery life of the ring. Prior it would last 6 days, now it barely lasts 3 days. I‚Äôm charging every other day to make sure it doesn‚Äôt lose my sleep data. Battery life is ridiculous. I now have to charge it daily or it runs out of gas! Please fix, hubby is having same problem  Update 2/12/23  As of this morning, app is not working. Ring is fully charged, but app is not reading my sleep info. Worked yesterday"
5,CBro_1,"Outstanding product, outstanding app!"
5,Db4567db,App not opening after updating to iOS 16.2 (20C65).  Worked perfectly before update.
2,hturuth,"Impression: Negative Very unintuitive user design/ user interface. Have all these fluff features that don‚Äôt have much in the way of functionality. They really should focus on basics which are falling short. 1. Instead of focusing on MORE features and fluff features, make sure the current features even have functionality. 2. Design and Build an interface that works and is intuitive to use. This UX is terrible. Cons -doesn‚Äôt always try to sleep correctly and frustratingly does NOT allow you to properly edit (even though it says you can) Example:I was awake and around 2:30 AM by someone with night terrors in the house‚Ä¶ went back to sleep a few minutes after. Oura did not detect my sleep prior to that.There is a space that allows you to edit your sleep time, but that app did NOT allow me to slide it to INCREASE the time, only to DECREASE the time. Makes me really question the quality of data. Update: you can no longer select edit AT ALL so unable to edit sleep time in ANY way. Update: not getting notifications when battery is low so I can charge it. Charging is becoming a hassle because it doesn‚Äôt give any indication. Only once it‚Äôs dead it says that isn‚Äôt good on battery life. There should be some kind of reminder. Cons- Activity can change A LOT in 5 min sometimes, especially when working out. More data = better accuracy Pros -fairly comfortable -pairs with Natural Cycles app. -Two reasons I got it: to track my sleep and my temperature for natural cycles app Note: NC recommends waiting until the first day of a cycle to switch temperature taking devices so I haven‚Äôt paired them quite yet - Will update. Update: Paired w NC ‚Ä¶ but quickly unpaired, which also turned out to be a huge hassle.  Returned the ring as it was essentially useless.   Update: developer responded and asked me to reach out for help ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As if it‚Äôs a user error type of issue‚Ä¶ no, it‚Äôs an Oura issue. Lots of issues. I‚Äôll leave that to you the Oura staff‚Ä¶to figure out‚Ä¶ if you wanna keep customers you gotta do better though."
2,Bicosan,"TL;DR: Had a ring for 2.5 years. Their surprise subscription requirement bricked my ring (I can‚Äôt sign up for it due to a website bug). Customer support will not answer repeated (cordial) requests to fix the matter.   The Full Story:  I initially bought my Oura Ring Gen 2 in March of 2020, and have been a huge fan of my Oura Ring. I responded to an offer for a free Gen 3 ring upgrade and was sent a replacement ring (and sent back my Gen 2 ring). According to the app, after having my new ‚Äúfree‚Äù ring for 6 months, I must now sign up for a subscription to continue using my ring. Yet, I am not able to activate the subscription, as my account page doesn‚Äôt have the links/options their documentation says it should. Repeated attempts to contact customer service have been completely ignored. So, my ring of 2.5 years is now bricked.   As you might guess, I am not happy that a product that I have been using for over 2.5 years suddenly is demanding I start paying a monthly fee to continue using the functionality I have very much enjoyed for years. This was not the understanding I had when I first bought the ring. I don't begrudge Oura for creating a subscription model for new users, but breaking functionality for me after 2.5 years feels like my device is being held hostage for further payment.   Nevertheless, I tried to follow the instructions to sign up for the subscription but found that my account page is missing whatever links, tabs, or subpages are necessary to sign up.  So, here I am at 2.5 years of ownership holding a non-functional Oura Ring. I've not only been a loyal customer but have been one who has recommended the ring to numerous people. I don't even care about the cost of the subscription; it's the way the company has gone about this that feels unethical.  This isn‚Äôt the first time I have dealt with their customer service. When I had a Gen 2 ring, I briefly switched to an Android phone. I found my Ring would not sync even after following all their instructions a million times. Customer service was not helpful. They just repeated the instructions on the website. Long story short, something specific to my account on the backend (in the cloud) was not compatible with Android, because the account had been first seeded by an iPhone (database format, for example). I finally figured out that creating a completely new account would make it work. When I switched back to an iPhone, I had to switch back to the former account.   Being a cloud services software developer myself, I thought they might appreciate a heads up about this. So I carefully wrote up the details and sent it to customer service. I received a non-sequitur, boilerplate reply with the same troubleshooting steps, as though I was just communicating with a robot that couldn‚Äôt pass the Touring Test (sadly, I think it was actually a human). So, my effort to help fell down the blackhole of apathetic customer service.   I‚Äôd hate to give up on a great piece of tech like this, but at this point, I‚Äôm afraid this company has invested too little in customer service to be useful."
1,kgaidis,Insta crashing
1,CSkywalker23,This app is seriously irritating. I have had to reinstall this app multiple times due to it not opening over the year or so that I‚Äôve had it. I just did it a couple days ago and here we are again.  10/13/22 DONE  This ring is now a $300 dollar piece of scratched up jewelry. I am so over reinstalling this app several times a month because it starts crashing. Then waiting over 15 minutes every time I have to try to get the ring to connect again. I absolutely regret this purchase. I‚Äôll just stick with Apple Watches thanks.
2,beulsch,"@ sleep tracking: oura ring underestimate sleep by 2 hours or more every night, no options to edit sleep towards more correct sleeping hours. @mediocre algorithm: recommendation based on sleep duration are automatically wrong when sleep not correctly registered, recommendation not always congruent with provided measurements @ age bias: I consistently burn more than 500 calories per day, as measure by Oura and other apps but the maximum goal Oura gives me are 300. With the new option to adjust the calorie goal the maximum I could adjust to was 400. However when I changed my age to 20 years younger I could set my goal to 500."
1,LITLP33,This once great product has become useless. For months now the app does nothing but crash and will have to be deleted every time and re set up from the beginning.After a long time of being a happy customer and a couple rings later I am now moving on from Oura. They have known about this issue and they cannot fix it
1,DarcSparc,"A year ago I would have given this company 4.5 stars.  They had exceptional customer service and a premium product.  The half-star reduction would have been due to their development team releasing a firmware update on my Gen 2 ring which killed the battery.  However, they immediately replaced the ring.  This experience encouraged me to buy the Gen 3 ring within months of buying the Gen 2.  Fast forward a year to 2022.  My wife and I both now have Gen 3 rings.  Mine has been perfectly fine, no issues.  My wife‚Äôs ring however was destroyed by a firmware update.  Contacted custom support, they identified they could see the battery drain issues.  However this time they respond with canned emails asking my wife to continue to charge her ring.  The battery never improved, and they confirmed they could still see that the ring was not working normally, yet still no replacement.  Now a new firmware actually 100% destroyed the ring, it no longer powers on or charges.  Still struggling with support and getting a replacement for a ring that is still fully under warranty.  Read reviews online.  It is now clear that their development team is immature and caused massive failure to customer rings.  I suspect they simply do not have the financial capability of replacing all the destroyed rings, hence the delay tactics.  I also suspect they are now trying to push customers beyond their warranty period so as to NOT replace the ring.  This company went from trustworthy to deceitful overnight.  Just do the research yourself.  If you want to have a high risk of throwing $300-400 in the trash for an experiment, go for it, but do so knowing that many customers are experiencing failed rings with zero support or warranty replacement while fully covered under warranty.  I will not be surprised to find out soon there is a class action lawsuit against Oura.  Good luck."
1,Meg_aggie,"Update 8-28 App is crashing again. Really annoying . It was crashing yesterday but did not have time to reload.                         Update 8-20 App crashed again. So irritating they have NOT fixed this bug. Update now app will not delete. Not stellar.8-2-22 App crashes, it‚Äôs a PITA to delete and reinstall. This is the 4th or 5th time in 2022 I have to delete an reinstall. 8-1-22 Lots of interesting data. I‚Äôve had my ring since June 2020. Sleep info is great. Couple of feedback items. 1. Feed steps and activity to Apple Health. 2. Allow app access at night to take a moment to meditate. The breathing bells is great, but if I wake up and want to use to get back to sleep it either ends sleep for night or restarts sleep vs just showing as Awake. Thanks looking forward to seeing what y‚Äôall have in store for the Oura Ring."
5,Areka,"This is the first smart device that I‚Äôve used that REALLY gets the nuances of you. It‚Äôs amazing. For example, when I had my second COVID vaccine, the day after, it recognized that my body temperature was slightly raised and that I needed to take it easy over the next few days. That‚Äôs something, because my baseline body temp is lower than most (96.5ish) but it had already learned what MY baseline temp was and detected when it went above that. I‚Äôve learned so much about my sleeping habits already and hope to continue and use it to improve on them. Related: the Apollo Neuro is wearable that uses haptic tech to aide with sleep, anxiety, etc. It‚Äôs a different type of game-changing device that I would recommend to anyone with insomnia or anxiety (I have both and it‚Äôs helped!)."
1,Keara G,"Oura should get on Amazon prime. For real. I waited for my 3-5 business day ring-sizer shipment for 14 DAYS. Next, gotta wait forever for the actual ring. That‚Äôs a month of fitness tracking down the drain."
4,Drwmstr,"Good APP, have the second generation ring for a few years now. Helped me out when I was having sleep issues back then. Almost upgraded to the newer ring but they wanted to go through the sizing again. Due to my full time RVing; the mailing logistics didn‚Äôt thrill me. Downside? Too much reliance on the internet for updates. Sync data? If it was kept on the phone and not having to be sync‚Äôed occasionally after updates (yes, occasionally and not every update)I would have kept using it. Once again however, I woke up to find the latest update required it to be synced once again, and I was back to my campsite with no internet for a few days. My timing seems to be that way, I usually get updates when I can use someone else‚Äôs Wi-Fi. It is now put away. Assuming the way things are?  probably for good. Just getting tired of everybody needing your data and wanting you to be ‚Äúconnected‚Äù If you don‚Äôt mind this? It is a good APP and they are constantly improving their product.The newer ring looks very promising but not thrilled about a subscription service. Thanks for the past service."
1,dlox_apple,Happening way to often now. Have to reinstall the app. Gen 3 hardware and app has been around for a few years now.Moving  backwards in reliability. Please fix. I have to delete and reinstall more and more.
1,JKnadian,"This app keeps crashing and after the 4th time of deleting the app, re-installing it, and then re-pairing my ring, I‚Äôve had it. If I‚Äôm paying $400 for a ring that doesn‚Äôt do anything else, I‚Äôll stick with my wedding band!  Edit 5/29/22 App still crashes constantly and the only fix is to continually re-install it. I‚Äôve had zero response from Oura. I‚Äôve heard good things about Whoop support so I just signed up to try it."
2,Nichole4FSU,"Oh hey, 5/25/22 update and the app won‚Äôt even open. So tired of this.   Again, with the latest app update, now my ring will not stay connect when of the charger. This is completely frustrating. IOS, latest version."
1,jeffbaum,"I didn‚Äôt want to send this through a review but there was no way to contact support.  There needs to be ‚Äúsend developer an email‚Äù link somewhere.  Support on website was just FAQ‚Äôs.    Need to make it easier to report issues.   After updating app to latest version today, the app immediately opens then crashes on ios15.4.1"
1,Jarrodj0526,"Totally non helpful. Had it for 3 weeks still have no idea how to set up and get it to track any data. No company sponsored YouTube video, horrible customer service support. Oh, and they never tell you to BUY 2 sizes LARGER THAN YOUR REGULAR RING SIZE!! Bcs all the stupid bumps take up a ton of extra space.  Ugh."
1,fuoura,Just another company that makes it Impossible to cancel my account‚Ä¶there should be a law against this‚Ä¶don‚Äôt buy the Oura ring‚Ä¶it does not work and don‚Äôt ask to join the SleepSpace‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt work and you pay 39.99 for that service that you can‚Äôt cancel‚Ä¶DO NOT BUY OURA RING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Dontcallmedoug,Over months of back and fourth a ring finally showed up and it‚Äôs not the correct size. I compared it with the size kit and it‚Äôs not the size I ordered. Now they want me to send it back before they send the correct size. I don‚Äôt trust I‚Äôll even get a replacement.
1,Jane7344,"I wrote a review a few months ago there apparently got deleted.  Bought oura ring September 2021.  Could not reach support for sizing help (webpage offered minimal help (canned replies), has been updated since and is better).  Finally after a week just guessed at size and completed order.  Got ring and size was too big (significant difference between sizing rings and actual rigs).  By then Oura 3 had been announced.  They ‚Äúhad‚Äù to resend me another sizing kit even though I learned later they were exactly the same.  Meanwhile I was using the ring.  Data was poor - it is supposed to recognize naps but did so only about half the time.  I can wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall asleep for 30-120 minute, oura rarely recognized me going back to sleep even when it was for 4 hours time.  There is no way to tell oura you were sleeping during that time - based on my HR alone oura should have seen I was sleeping.  If sleep time is not accurate all their stats are way off - eg sleep score, readiness,   Even resting heart rate (which is lowest later in the sleeping period and was wrong when hours is my later sleep was not recognized).    Worst part because customer support was so bad I could not return the ring.  The portal didn‚Äôt recognize my order number and then said it was past the return date, even though I had until Jan 31 to return the ring.  Support never responded to the many tickets I did except occasional canned messages saying to use the return portal that didn‚Äôt work (they obviously were not reading my ticket that said they portak didn‚Äôt work). Finally over 4 months later, a month after I disputes the charge in my credit card, they finally got the portal fixed (probably got the dispute and rather the take the hit for a dispute fixed the portal so they can say it was  a simple refund instead).  Check the recent reviews, if I would have seen all the other complaints about support the last 6-12 months I never would have ordered the ring.  This is an early adopter products (eg still not fully developed), so support and the ability to do returns - both in a timely manner - is absolutely necessary."
1,VenkiApps,"Due to size problem I have returned my oura ring(order # SO-40614077). My return shipment was delivered on Dec23 2021. But still no replacement ring. I have opened support case (request (1016733)) with Oura, no response. They are simply saying it was delivered on Dec 14 2021. But it was returned for an exchange. Then there is no response from support. This is all email. There is no phone number to contact. Now a days even small companies have user chat/account portal. I don‚Äôt know why Oura is missing all that after selling a product for 300$ and monthly subscription."
4,Jmsincla,The program is exceptional and the hardware is even more exceptional. I‚Äôm certain this only affects a very small percentage of users like myself but I would like to be able to import all of my data if I switch from android to Apple and Apple to android. At present it does not transfer any of my data from my other operating system. I realize the data exists on the web but that defeats the purpose of the app. Please have re-integration occur when switching operating systems. Thank you!!!!
1,abeardneglected,Ticket 943281 is going on two weeks old with no response. The ring doesn‚Äôt pick anything up at night.
1,KarlAgathon,"12-5-21: Support has responded with a list of things to try: none of which have worked after two more hours of experimenting. None of the suggestions coincide with what is available in the app.   My Generation 3 ring will still not connect with my iPhone 13.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî It won‚Äôt connect to my new Generation 3 ring, so I can‚Äôt see any data. Support has not responded in a week."
2,TJ WW,I paid for the new version of the ring and they did not have it. Will they ever send it to me? Not a good company.
1,gdmac,"I have been try get get a refund on a ring that I never received. Multiple emails sent. No phone number to contact them. They were willing to take my $335.98. Very disappointed. This is my second ring, and probably last."
1,normal_old_lady,I have been trying to get assistance since 10-30-21 and have not been able to get in contact with anyone who can help me. I believe I‚Äôm only speaking to bots.
1,Logic413,"First and foremost, I love this product. I‚Äôm an advocate of what it stands for and leverage this information to optimize myself. I‚Äôve put many friends and family on to this product. However, the durability is questionable. I was in Alaska hiking, and was traveling down a challenging trail, when we was climbing and was pulling myself up from a rock when my ring broke. I reached out to Oura to see if you would be able to replace my ring with no fees considering I received the ring less than a year ago and would fit under warranty I didn‚Äôt have a picture of the broken ring as it fell off and landed somewhere I couldn‚Äôt find considering where I was! No changes are needed , only a replica of the stealth heritage that I had. CUSTOMER SERVICE should be important to most companies, doesn‚Äôt seem it‚Äôs a priority for this one. This was the response ‚Äú Unfortunately your case is not covered under warranty but I would like to offer a discount‚Äù you give discounts to people who dont even have rings! So, my response to the rep was ‚Äú wanted to inquire as to why the ring wouldn‚Äôt be under warranty if it was less than a year? When climbing, the ring had cracked and broke as I was grabbing a rock. The durability and workmanship of the ring should of withstood the climb, as I used the ring in accordance to the purpose and with no abuse. I would of course love to get another stealth ring that I had, but my circumstances financially has changed over this year, would make it difficult to purchase another ring‚Äù. I guess there response to my message was nothing! No response and still waiting ! Way to treat clients that advocate your product! I‚Äôll make sure to get out what this company really stands for! There bottom line with a B.S mission who dont care about the their customers! Sorry for the long winded story but wanted to make sure everyone understands what they stand for!"
1,Claritense,Automatic Activity Detection was launched on February 17th and Nap Detection on May 4th. Android users do not have any of those  updates. Everybody pays the same amount of money for the ring but some users receive more benefits than others. Had I known that I would not have bought the ring.
4,ccm52,"I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt do this in the first place. The graph showing a line without any scale is basically useless if that value changes. If it DOES go up or down, it could be anything, 0.00001 or 132 degrees F for all I know.   PLEASE add values to the y-axis. I think it‚Äôs important for people to know exactly how much their skin temp changes.   P.S. Absolutely love the app and product though! Keep it up"
4,dobleturbo,Been having this ring for months now only use the ring to sleep.From all these updates I have notice my battery dying quicker and quicker Oura please fix. Also it would be nice if you guys add more moments features I use the ones there every night to go to sleep and it helps. More great updates and battery issue fix.
