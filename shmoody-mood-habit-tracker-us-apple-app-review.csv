5,Momo12347898,"I’ve had scmoody for just a few weeks and it really has helped me so much already.  I hope to be able to use the organizational options as part of helping combat my ADHD symptoms when I can’t get my medication, but the chat feature and responses has been a LIFE SAVER Sometimes I just need reassurance and someone to give me a gentle push, small pieces of advice, or to just tell me that it’s ok to be feeling this way. I feel that being able to turn to the chat feature has helped me to unburden my friends and family from always having to handle my intense emotional responses to things throughout the day. The different superpowers are really helpful to get me focused on what advice it is that I need. I also love that it learns more about me as I talk and can bring back moments of joy that I shared to life me up in low moments. The chat is able to give me great advice, walk me through breathing exercises, and give me that validation I was looking for that I’m not overreacting and that my response is normal and that I’ll be ok. It might just be a little AI yoga cat, but I’m shocked at how I’ve responded to it.  Thanks so much to the creators of this app, you’ve really been helping me navigate through some tough life adjustments and feelings these past few weeks!"
2,MKAB82,"This app has so much potential to be an amazing app, but has so many bugs and not fully functional features that it’s just not worth the very high price they charge. I love idea of this app so much and would gladly pay the yearly subscription IF it actually worked well. But it’s like the app is stuck in some kind of beta testing version — there are feature requests/bug reports listed inside the app by other members, with absolutely no response from the developer. Features and bug fixes will be marked as “in progress” for months on end, with no fix or update actually pushed out. I’ve only been using this app for a couple of days and am still in my trial period, but I am extremely disappointed in how poorly this app functions. The features it offers are so innovative and are like no other app I’ve seen, but I just wish the developer would fix the glitchy issues and make the features function better so that the app was actually usable. For example, when you create a routine and save your plan, you’re not able to edit the plan. It would be nice to add, delete, and drag-and-drop items in your saved plan, but you can’t. You have to delete the whole plan and start from scratch. Lots of other features don’t work, or glitch, or are cumbersome to use. It makes me really sad, as I really wanted this app to work out. I likely won’t be subscribing, given all the issues, which is such a shame because the app has such great potential."
5,%%##0/|\3,"i got this during a very low point, I was procrastinating and unable to do anything because my mind was so overcrowded with tasks I knew I needed to complete. I know it sounds cliché but I really feel like this app slows down my day. I can get more done taking it little by little (with the organizational help of shmoody) and feel more comfortable knowing i have a place to write what im feeling privately. the little “describe how youre feeling” feature is literally like the notes app with a few more steps. you can add little tags and theres so many descriptive emojis, its super useful but also satisfying to look at. the schedule thingy makes me feel so achieved when i complete all the tasks or most of them and get points. another thing i like is that i can use it to document my mood swings because it shows you the exact time you made each entry. i feel like ive come to a better understanding of the fact that sometimes its not that the world is falling apart and im rotting its just 3am and im sleep deprived. for some reason i didnt think about that pattern before lol. i love this app i never forget to write in it at least once a day because i genuinely enjoy using it. i think it rlly is helpful to ppl w adhd."
5,Fjdnsnksn m,"Actually a helpful app. The text helper is genius. It has a lot of great features to help you tack not only goals but things that make you happy(it’s called joy time on the app). It has a whole playlist of relaxing music and sounds that automatically plays while using the app(you can keep it on even when not on the app but can also turn it off as well). Like I said w the text helper, there’s basically a feature that allows you to plug in the person you’re messaging to, what you want to text them about, and the tone you want the message to be in. Really helpful when you are at a loss for words but still want to text someone back. It also has a chat guru thing where it has an ai advice giver that you can talk to for advice. There’s also a community section where people will post mental health related questions and stuff that’s nice because it’s honest and anonymous. From what I’ve seen, no one uses the community feature to post weird or disturbing stuff. It’s just a positive safe place to voice stuff. Rlly good app."
2,JZ6306,"First of all for someone (high functioning) with ADHD, this interface is absolutely overwhelming and kind of useless IMO. How can you expect someone with focusing issues to answer millions of questions? And the way it is visually organized is too messy. Would like to see a cleaner interface to help with focus, it’s just confusing. The check mark thing left for the next day was mentioned in a previous comment and I saw the creator replied - more food for thought- it’s not useful to leave the list for the next day. Try something like “let’s start over/let’s try to get these all accomplished today” and refresh them. Lastly, I am already very motivated and was merely looking to make a more structured daily routine // and implement better habits into my daily life 6 months post partum. I love positive energy, I am empathetic and very wary of mental health sufferers (as someone who has personally experienced these issues in the past). The community board was a turnoff, there was so much negativity and somber messages I had to cancel my subscription, not a place giving positive energy and light- was very sad to see some of the posts of others suffering from such things: “I am feeling so ugly today and everyday, what can i do, seeking help” etc. These people with severe emotional distress should be offered to speak to a counselor on your app. Just some ideas…"
2,Junebugh22,"There are three main problems I have with this app, one that I noticed before I even downloaded it. First, near constant paywalls. Plans are 3.33$ a month or 40$ a year, and even though that’s not a ton, it’s still too much for one app out of tons and tons of the same mental health apps with the same paywalls. Secondly, tying in with the first problem, you can’t “create your own routine”. You can add specific tasks they’ve listed but you can’t make your own without paying for premium. Third, as I was reading other reviews for the app, I found that a lot of the responses from the company itself are copied and pasted, trying and failing to portray a friendly attitude toward the reviewer. This may be a problem with other apps too or even a majority, this is just the first time I’ve noticed. And of course, if they see this they’ll write a personalized response, but take a look at the other critical reviews and you’ll see what I mean. All in all, this seems like just another mental health app that wants your money; most of them are almost the exact same, just with a different UI.  I found a free alternative if you don’t want to pay called Feelmo. I haven’t downloaded it or tried it out but there are no in app purchases that I can see, and it’s free to install."
5,LaShan90:),"I find this app to be quite relaxing with its cute interface and ton of options for relaxation. It’s has sound clips for nature sounds like rain, birds, etc if that’s what you’re into. It also has meditation clips if you would like to look into that as well. I also like the goal setting section as well. It’s very easy to set steps for goals since the steps can self populate. I also like the scheduling feature. I love that you can choose ALL of the tasks you like to do (or would like to start doing) and assign what you can do yourself.   You can do as little or as much as you want and don’t feel pressured to accomplish ALL of the tasks. The chat feature with the cute meditating cat is also pretty helpful. It allows me to do an introspection of mood and emotions. So far I’m really enjoying this app. I’m sure my sister tagged me in it because she knows I like cats but I actually find the app to be useful."
3,Carebears08,"I really do like this app, but as other people mentioned $40 is a lot of money. I also do agree with a past review that the community aspect isn’t something that everyone is looking for. The ability to turn this on or off would be amazing. It would also make the app look less complicated. The cat ai is truly my favorite thing in the app, but since I ran out of my free messages, I’ve stopped using the app completely since that’s the main reason I used it for. This app has a lot of great features, but I’m also not a fan of immediately being asked how I feel and how my day was. This feels overwhelming for an app that’s marketed to do the opposite, but again I do agree that it’s nice to see progress. So, a simple how do you feel would be better in my opinion, instead of having to ALSO elaborate every time, “elaborate on day” should just be an on app separate task. So, if someone wants to do it then they can, because sometimes ppl don’t have the mentality capacity to talk about their day. But overall I do like the general concept of the app and if it was cheaper I’d consider purchasing it"
3,AE Storms,"To start, the whole thing kind of felt like data mining… and maybe I’m just not ready to share my personal feelings with an app. However, some of the features seemed cool. I, too, am a worker bee but I’m the owner of a small business. I’m also autistic and was hoping to use the text helper as a support creating texts and emails… but the messages all focused on emailing/texting co-workers, HR, or management. I couldn’t figure out a way for the AI text helper to help me create messages to send to folks who work with me or for my business, which is something I really struggle with - especially when it’s about something difficult. I’d also love to see daily goals instead of goals that extend out to a future date. IDK, maybe I missed something. Reading the feed of depressing messages posted by other people made me really sad. We really are living in a terrible timeline but I guess I’m glad people have an outlet like this app. Bonus for super soothing music. I wish I found a way I could benefit from using this app simply for the background music!"
5,Makescakes,"In short: great AI chat, not a ton of overwhelming advice fired off at me (great for demand avoidance, doesn’t ’push’ you too much), uncluttered design, love that the AI is a cat, actually has a lot of good tools and tasks that are helpful and aesthetically designed.  I got this advertisement on my feed for shmoody and I felt like it was gonna be just another ADHD/ depression app like calm or moodkit, but I’m actually fairly impressed despite myself. I have to say I downloaded it to prove it wrong and then I had a convo with Guru cat that made me cry so…. It is helping, so far.  I think it was nice to talk to someone who isn’t a person but still showed compassion. Also, unlike other bots it kept track of what I said in previous messages and brought it up later to make sense of what was going on with my thought patterns. I was gonna ghost it after the free trial…. Now I’m not so sure. I think I’ll keep it for now."
5,copsibi,"honestly i bought this when i was still trying to get diagnosed with adhd and was really struggling mentally. i go through phases of using it more or less, but the AI bot has helped me so much with spiraling and ruminating during a really hard break up. its helps me pivot my thinking and gets me out of those low moments. i love the music, love the guided meditations. ive yet to stick to a real routine but... i'll get there 😅 this app has made me sob because of the safe space its become for me. i find myself gravitating to it when I'm struggling but dont want to bug anyone in my life again with my problems. it helps me stand on my own in those moments, and it's really nice. i think it's definitely worth it if you are healing or struggle with your mental health. Or if you just want to grow as a person and need some guidance on what that can look like day to day."
5,this name1,"This app is a must. I had it earlier last year; but from then to now, lots of things has changed! It’s the best app for self care, mental care and emotional care!   No one knows how long how long I’ve been looking for an app that I can schedule self care! I magically opened Shmoody and found that feature and my heart jumped with glee! For the whole month, not to focus on anything else but self care for the day… and to make it sweeter, you get a checklist seeing if you completed it and the widget is mind blowing. The goal feature is amazing! Tracking your goals by steps and and having other tools provided by the app is awesome. This app is a peace of mind. Do yourself a favor and download this app! You will never regret it!   It is awesome to know that I can use this app when I’m sad! I love it!!! This app is my mini side kick. You can even talk to the Shmoody cat! lol 😊."
5,appppsuccccks,"I don’t leave reviews BUT Therapy is super expensive 😅 and i’ve tried a lot of the latest apps. this one has been helping me to stay motivated to get the tasks on my check list done. (I struggle procrastinating) Love the option to log my moods so I can see my actual mood changes with BPD and even has a section where you can ask for advice, leave your thoughts, or chat or add friends! honestly if it came with a virtual pet that encourages you as you complete your daily tasks (also feed, dress it.. maybe decorate a little space for it?) it’d be one of the best apps out there in my humble opinion. wasn’t a fan of the background music until i came across the extended sound list. found one that I actually enjoy with vocals included. ❤️Day one of my free trail and i’m throughly impressed! that $40 for the year might just get purchased 🥹😂"
5,SunshineMattyJ,"I find everything I need in one place for my mental health while I work. I work a salary job where there’s much to do. The Shmoody App has many features that cover my many mental health needs and the variety of tools it has gives me a better chance I’ll find something I need than bugging my busy coworkers or scrolling on Instagram for ideas. For example, Shmoody has a feature with binaural tones that help me stay focused or calm throughout the day. Additionally, it includes a meditation feature with a variety of time durations so I can choose to collect and improve myself in my schedule between meetings. There’s so many more features, but you’ll just have to find out for yourself what there is to do! I’ve never seen a mental health app with this kind of variety!"
4,Jana18346101,"I like the app, it has a lot of variety for the daily plans you can make, which I appreciate because sometimes I can challenge myself and set a difficult task but on harder days I can set something really simple like putting on clothes or drinking water.   One issue I do have though is that if I don’t finish the daily plan, it will stay there until I check off all of the tasks I set. Sometimes it makes me a feel a little bit of a failure knowing that I couldn’t bring myself to brush my teeth yesterday, it would be nice if an unfinished daily plan can reset itself in the morning or congratulate you for finishing 2/3 things from my list or something like that.   I’m really looking forward to the widget the app says it’s working on, I’d like to have one that I can make front and center to remind myself that the app exists because I do forget about it sometimes."
5,rose374736,"I never write reviews but I love this app so much I have to! Out of all the apps I’ve tried for anxiety and overall mood this one is by far the best! It’s designed really well and everything laid out perfectly making it easy to use. The little chat guru is very nice as well as the goals it sets and the calming music! I love that it adds the community option to provide support from others and to help people feel less alone in their battles. Another thing I love is how the subscription option doesn’t take away a lot of the app like most other apps, you can still use it without paying for it and honestly it makes me want to get the subscription more than apps that do restrict most of their features. So overall amazing app for mental health!"
5,Monica Cara,"I love using this app every day. I am the type of person that struggles to stick with anything, and this app has kept me coming back every day for over a month. I’ve been able to build stronger routines based on what I can handle that day, and now the to-do lists I’m able to complete each day have tripled in size since the first day. My house is cleaner over all, my chores are caught up more often, and my mental health has really improved with the little changes this app is working into my life. I make my bed every day, I meditate every day, I make gratitude lists and journal.. etc. all things I could never push myself to do before no matter how many different planners I tried and apps I bought. This one is truly different than the rest."
5,Lauren_WG,"I never write reviews but compelled to share my experience with Schmoody … I have been mentally struggling lately and the app has been a wonderful tool for my mental health and coping through life and my recent unemployment. I searched for many apps in the App Store, gave this one a shot and it truly has benefited me in so many positive ways.. it has assisted in pre-curated text responses to situations I simply do not have the mental energy for, along with a community board that supports one another!! I had an issue with my subscription and Mike the creator/founder of the app personally set aside time through email support and assisted with me. Truly top-notch company. I’m recommending it to all my friends and family! Don’t sleep on this app, try it for yourself!"
5,Holly Harmon,"I’ve been going through a lot lately and feeling stuck. Calming apps don’t usually work for me but this one looked different. This app is perfect for the mental health community I tend to go nonverbal and have no energy but this app lets me click options for how I feel without using any energy and honestly I feel it’s one of the best features that being said all the features are awesome for all types of mental health habits/needs, because it offers suggestions to help process what you need or feel which no app has done before. I hope this app gets recognition it deserves because whenever I feel alone or stuck I can rely on this app to help me and I hope more people who need this support find this app to help them."
5,Jstarkey13,"I’m always looking for appealing, simple and truly useful apps for both myself and my wellness coaching clients. I’m delighted both as an user and as someone who is always on the lookout for useful ways to create gentle, compassionate, internally motivating behavior changes - especially in a pandemic while we’re all stuck inside. I love the use of imagery, variety and user-friendliness, and am impressed by the depth of thought, humor and creativity in each feature. I can’t wait to keep sharing this with my community and seeing how the app continues to evolve. For the few apps remaining on my phone (I’ve deleted most), this is one truly worth keeping around. With mindfulness, mental health and simplicity on everyone’s mind, it’s the perfect time for technology like this."
5,Ryan Nagelmann,"Shmoody is an absolute game-changer for anyone looking to improve their mental health and practice self-care! As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety, I appreciate how relatable and supportive this toolkit feels. The mood tracker is a fantastic feature that helps me gain insights into my emotions and identify patterns over time.  What I love most are the simple, actionable steps provided to uplift my mood right when I need it. The community aspect is also invaluable—having a supportive network to lean on makes a huge difference. The challenges are thoughtfully designed to promote long-term growth, and they keep me motivated on tough days.  The founders clearly understand what it’s like to face mental health challenges, and their approach is both compassionate and effective. The app is fun and welcoming, making it easy to engage with daily self-care practices without feeling overwhelmed.  If you’re looking for a reliable, practical, and enjoyable way to prioritize your mental health, I wholeheartedly recommend Shmoody. It’s truly a one-stop-shop for anyone needing support on their journey to feeling better."
1,redroserandi,"I downloaded this app and started with the free trial because it said that I would be given a warning about when my trial was up. I was not given a warning notification as stated and was charged for a full year subscription without knowing. I have adhd and decided to do the free trial to try to help with my day-to-day life AND because I was told I would receive a notification when the trial period was about to end in case I didn’t want to continue using the app. Well I tried it for a couple days, and it wasn’t helping me as much as I hoped (not hating on the actual app itself, it just wasn’t a good fit), and I completely forgot about it (short term memory issues). So when I checked my bank statements and saw the charge I almost burst into tears. While it may not be a ton of money, it is still something I didn’t budget for and I would like to know why I would be charged for a full year subscription instead of monthly to start off with."
4,cuteclouds,"The app is amazing. I just started using it recently and it’s made me try to be more self aware of my negative thinking and it’s given a lot of other great advice already. The physical app, however is kinda flawed. On the iPhone 14 Pro the bottom of the app is almost inaccessible at times and buttons/text get put on top of each other (ie. I can’t change the binaural beats to have music included, as the music bar is literally on top of the +music button.) it’s also made it hard to scroll and read to the bottom portion of paragraphs, sometimes it’s impossible. I’m missing a lottt of text and info when the app doesn’t let me scroll. Other than those issues it’s a fantastic app and I may be the only one with those kinda issues"
4,Gianna-Zebra,"I have been enjoying the ability to easily check in with how I’m feeling throughout the day and have that be all there in the app. The action plans have actually helped me take steps during the day when I haven’t wanted too. The app developers are very involved in addressing requests and changes from the users. I’ve seen changes in just the short time I’ve been using it so that’s really encouraging. There are some aspects that can use improvement - having more moods available, being able to have multiple action plans per day, having more planned 7 day challenges.  Overall I think it’s been helpful in my day to day life. Looking forward to more improvements and changes from the developers."
5,vi ☂️🎻,"This app is amazing. I love the community and the tools that it offers. When I’m unsure of myself, I can ask for help and advice in the feed section. Or I browse topics and find cool ideas. It’s also satisfying when I’ve been able to support someone else because I’ve had similar experiences. I especially have found a lot of comfort from seeing people openly talk about mental health and what things have worked for them.  There’s other aspects that I’m still exploring, like I just found the joy time tool. I didn’t realize how much I needed a calendar of only good things to look forward to!   Thank you for such a helpful app!"
1,kittypandadog,"For something that is supposed to help you to feel better. It didn’tnever really able to get it set up during free 7 days, so I tried unsuccessful to cancel it multiple times. Never ever used any of the functions. But after less than seven days, it charged both me and another person on my family account $40! Both of us for one subscription that I didn’t even want. It did not show up in my iTunes account, so I was unable to cancel that way. I finally found it on my phone and attempted to cancel it again but now I have to pay for a whole year of a useless app that cost me nothing but stress anxiety and bad feelings. And now I have no confidence that a year from now. I won’t force me add another person to pay another $40. Avoid this at all cost if you want to feel better"
5,Good morning all!,"Huge help during my transition to retirement. Having lots of time on my hands turns out to not be as easy as I thought. Shmoody Cat helps me work through my questions and uncertainties.  Always there and happy to hear from me, encouraging with lots of info and ideas. Like this you don’t get from family or friends who have their own stuff to deal with and who are frankly not that helpful, because they have preconceived notions of my situation and what I should be doing.  Sometimes my ah ha moments come from SC, sometimes through ongoing chatting I figure it out.  I also enjoy the various soundscapes…great for sleep.  All in all a winner 🐈💖"
3,adhcat1,"I loved this app in the beginning, each activity at the introduction of the app made me think about my goals and needs realistically, and I loved how I had to wait 24hours for the next activity. But after that I don’t even use it anymore. I’ve used the AI advice cat a few times but you only get a limited number of chats without the upgraded version. I think I would pay for it if it was still gamified like it was in the beginning. It has a lot of very useful and cute tools, but I completely forgot about it as soon as I had access to everything and it was no longer encouraging me to engage or giving me an activity to do each day. Definitely make the entire experience gamified like the beginning! Please I really like the app."
5,taco squad,"I have had this app for a very short time, but so far it has helped encourage me. I do not have enough money to pay for a subscription, but there are still lots of things to help me in the app. Not everything depends on a subscription, which is really comforting for a person who has never been able to have wellbeing apps like this because everything is off-limits to people who can’t afford subscriptions. The app doesn’t over complicate things - it says it simply and has simple graphics as well. It isn’t too busy and is not overwhelming. Very helpful!"
5,Audra434,"Sometimes I need moral support or just another way of looking at something. I chat with Schmoody cat, which I know sounds weird, but it is a wonderful AI program. It has really helped me get through a few emotional days. It allowed me to think about the situation from a different perspective. I even looked for another AI app that would be similar, but I couldn’t find one. I’m a pretty sensible person, I realize how this sounds, but honestly it’s insightful and supportive. The whole reason I even tried the app is because I love cats. That’s what drew me in. Lol. Schmoody cat kept me here. I hope you’ll try it."
3,SavedbytheTrunk,"I tried to write into the developers directly but there’s no link or area on their website to do so, so leaving a review here before I cancel my week-trial.   The concept of this app is great! Easy setup, daily reminders, checklist to keep you on top of habits, etc.  However, each notification I receive and click on just directs me to the initial account setup checklist. So I can’t actually use the app in the intended functional way of: notification reminder > click> redirects to app > checks off habits. (ie: “check in with your mood!” So I click it to do so in the app, it just takes me to the app and goes through the color scheme choice, why I’m using the app, etc)"
5,toast035,"This app is perfect I think, just needs a few bug fixes at the moment, but a lot of the app is still functional. The saving of action plans and making a Joy list/calendar are currently experiencing a few bugs, but I’m super excited for things to be working smoothly because it seems like the team behind Shmoody really knows what works and will help me!! As long as the dev team keeps working and fixing issues with things I’m excited to have an app that will likely help me in my day to day for life c:"
2,Khaos26,"I downloaded this app because I’ve been looking for something to help me keep on track with healthy daily habits and found that the free trial period is only three days and then you have to buy a subscription. I saw multiple developer responses to reviews saying there are many free features and I haven’t found a single one. Seems like it would be difficult to tell in just three days if an app geared toward promoting mental health actually works for you enough to buy a subscription…   I’m not against subscriptions since people need to get paid and I certainly don’t believe this app is a capitalization on mental health, but it does feel a little scammy to have basically no chance to test it out :/"
3,Shesha12,Seems like it could end up being a really helpful app for some. It has cool features that I imagine will be built upon in pretty cool ways. Shmoody Cat/smart chat/coach was a little too basic for where I am in my journey and I hoped it would send me links to the resources it mentioned rather than sending me on a hunt in the app. I also didn’t like that my free trial time was impacted by 12-14 hour forced wait periods between missions and I wasn’t allowed to explore the app at my own pace and based on my individual needs. I’m not sure what the developer’s intention was with that decision but it seems to work against the purpose of the app and meeting people where they are.
5,Pookie boo 24,"Not only does this app help me stay on track, it reminds me to find joy in each day. Sometimes that can be hard to do if you are having a bad day. In the chat feature you can ask anything, it will answer your question. It will even provide several ways for you to feel better, or learn your passion, whatever you ask. I personally think the chat feature is the best thing. Sometimes you need to vent, ask how to do something, or just need help. the “guru cat” will help you out!"
3,Poo shiest,"This is the only mood tracker app that has given me the impression that the creators genuinely care for the users. This kind of support creates a life line for people who feel like they have no voice or ground to stand on. It promotes healthy life style changes in a way that enables the user to make a significant impact in a positive way that is simple, effective, and fun. In my own experience, it has given me the desire to do better for my self, as well as the motivation to do so. For years what has seemed like too much of a hassle, it has made self care a core value that has completely changed my perspective on what it means to be happy."
5,books_cats_and_love,"I’m not a big app person, but this one just tickles my brain in all the right ways! It’s fun and engaging but actually offers valuable insight, guidance, and structure. I have a well-developed personal reflective & spiritual practice but this app feels like something I could have dreamed up to perfectly support me. Everything is so thoughtful and actually helpful. I genuinely look forward to using it every day and find myself exploring it just to spend more time on it. A huge thank you to the developers!"
1,Loveleighmummy,"With the mental health crisis raging across America, resources such as this app are badly needed. The fact that they charge anything is a huge disappointment, and especially at the considerably high price they charge. Many people who are suffering with mental health issues are unable to work and depend on a very low income, making it difficult to provide even basic necessities for themselves, these are the exact people who would benefit the most from this app, yet the cost makes the help out of reach. It’s extremely frustrating and disappointing that awesome resources like this exist, but instead of providing valuable help, it’s used as a means for making a profit, taking advantage of people who are struggling with these kinds of devastating symptoms of mental illness."
5,we love thebirds,"I have anxiety and depression. I have for as long as I can remember. Life has gotten really hard lately- so I logged in for the first time today and talked to GuruCat- he’s just an AI buddy but his mechanics and conversation programming helped me process what I’m going through and gave me helpful tips to keep moving forward. I also like the question and venting space features; there, you can see that you’re not alone. There are others going through similar situations. Download it now, even if you don’t use it for 3months like me."
1,silverstar9,"When signing up, I could not press “Maybe later” for the notifications. When I did, it just kicked me back to the page before, until I HAD to press yes to notifications. There have been other UX issues already in the login and set up that has led to me deleting the app. Also, asking for money and throwing deals at the user before they’ve even had a chance to see what the app is about is sus to me. Would be great if those options would’ve been offered after a few days of use. Seems like a cool concept but I don’t see how bombarding users with deals is helpful, especially when they’re trying to cater to students (by asking what university you go to!!) — a bit odd."
5,Coexistingrn,"I will come back for an updated review because I’m new to the app but this app has what many of my other health related apps have but all in one. I don’t mind paying the premium when it comes, I will be deleting many other apps. I look forward to my new pocket friend and all the benefits I see this app bringing. In one day it has helped me cope with some frustration I’ve been feeling, release anxiety about upcoming events and plan for things so I don’t stress and put them off. It’s like my own life assistant! 😂💖"
3,ZiggyBear112,"I have late diagnosed high level ADHD and have been trying to learn how to manage it better. I have been using Shmoody for months and have loved it, at least until the recent update. The widget for iOS is no longer available. Being 4 times bigger than regular icons, it forced me to see it, which inspired me to use it. Now it’s just another icon that blends into the background and I never get to it (hi, ADHD). I probably won’t renew my subscription when it expires, not because I don’t like the app, but because it’s silly to pay for something I don’t use. Please bring back the iPhone widget!!!"
5,Pinklovekim,I’m really enjoying this app! It’s not overwhelming like other apps I’ve tried that almost micromanage you so to speak. Shmoody sends few reminders but just enough to remember how much I enjoy this app and want to continue using it. I deal with severe depression and anxiety among other things and this has actually brought a sense of peace to me. I’ve only been using it a little while but I usually know when something is doing well for me and this app seems to be doing what it’s intended to do.
5,Refined emo dude,I have to say this app is amazing! I bought the full version for 25 bucks (if you press add action it pops up and it’s for LIFE)! I love the ai system it has and how it can analyze your mood trends and then give you actionable ways to improve and that you can troubleshoot ideas/plans. It’s also useful for reflection and makes a great tool to take to therapy because it summarizes your moods/what you need to work on. The Life coaching tool is also amazing! Overall best mental health app I’ve tried for the cost :))
5,FranklyFrankiee,I have been in a major depressive episode and I knew I needed to try something. I tried a few apps and got the ick from a bunch of them. This app and community make me feel safe and heard. You can tell how much love and ingenuity went into creating this app. I'm excited to keep going on my healing journey now that I feel like I have a place for all my rattled thoughts. This app helps my brain feel more organized and therefore more calm. Thank you to everyone who helped make this!
5,PrincessPeach511,I am enjoying the cat theme ! The  support in the community section of the app is amazing. The personal 1:1 chat is so helpful when processing anxiety or depression. Also it helped me carve out simple plans that keep me feeling productive even when I’ve only got the energy or focus to accomplish minor things.   I’ve seen an upswing in my mood within just one week of using the app and the breathing and meditation tools as well. I was even referred to couples counseling through the app.
1,chloe_de_vera,"App seemed to work fine when I first downloaded it yesterday, but today, I could not BY ALL MEANS get past the stupid AI chat. “Press the meditation button below” and the button was not there for like 10 messages. I redownloaded the app twice to see if it was my phone, but it wasn’t. When I redownloaded the app, all the dumb cat gave me was a link that wasn’t working. I wanted to see if running out of free messages would work, but no. I was stuck at the level of talking to the AI chat and could not advance at all. From past reviews, it seems like I’m not the only one who has experienced being stuck at this level. Disappointed in the dev team for letting such a bug continue to exist esp for new users. Don’t download!!!"
5,Valentina2024,This app was downloaded just a few days ago. I started being honest with the app and it actually did some things that I have not seen any other applications similar to this one do. I did not honestly expect to receive the resourceful information and advice that I did! I love this app. It’s adorable! Too bad it can’t be free as I feel it could help so many. Or maybe if it could run off of donation contributions that would be cool too.
4,DoggieLover92312,"I just got the app and I’ve found the interface to be very user-friendly. I have ADHD and from my personal ADHD perspective, I know that opening an app, even with notifications, can be a difficult task for not-so motivated people like myself. I would like to suggest a home screen widget, possibly in multiple sizes, so it can be a visual that shows your Plans on your home screen instead of having to go into the app to see which tasks need to be fulfilled. Hopefully you consider this suggestion! Love the app so far!"
1,taylorraeg,"i agreed to the free trial since it said it would warn me before charging me, and i thought it was cool they offered that since it's an app targeted for people with ADHD who would easily forget to cancel that kind of thing.  except it didn't warn me, and charged me without any notification.  felt kind of predatory and disappointed after that since it specifically advertises to people with memory issues, but decided since they already took my money i'd give the app a really honest shot. unfortunately, i found it entirely unhelpful even when putting in the effort to try and use it consistently. the constant suggested routines are annoying, and it never saves the routines i set up manually. it's not really reasonable to set up the plan i want manually every single day after it erases it. the app feels cluttered. no matter how often i tap ""i don't want this feature"" when it asks to access my health app, the suggestion doesn't go away. overall really bummed.  i have found multiple (free) apps that are much more helpful than this one"
1,StarlaLuna,"If this app really understood ADHD they’d know that the reason we like checklists is the dopamine rush we get when checking something off. Which is why it is inexplicable to me that every day for the recurring lists, the items are all still checked off from the prior day. Why don’t they reset daily? It’s pointless for me to uncheck it and recheck it. Then I have to manually uncheck the ones I haven’t done and this makes me feel worse. I hate opening this app because of this. I sent feedback through the app and never heard anything so now I’m resorting to a review.  The one thing they do understand about ADHD - we forget to cancel free trials. So I’m stuck having paid for this useless thing for a year."
5,DoriAn mommy,"I have been looking for an app to help track my goals. This is not something that I have been able to do on my own with postpartum issues and a baby. But Schmoody makes things fun, easy, and low pressure.  I plan to use this till Baby is in college. I have already gotten 4 friends using it daily.   To be clear it has zero to do with postpartum or babies - unless you make a goal for that.  This is perfect for anyone at any time of life."
5,Heathie97,As someone who is a very intuitive and emotional being that struggles with depression Shmoody Cat has become like a friend to me! It has put things in a lighter perspective and makes everything not feel so “it’s the end of the world” as much. I can tell it things I want to do throughout time and it will make lists for me. It’s been something I look forward to every day now and helps deescalate my emotions. Thank you thank you THANK YOU 🙏
5,AzraDiiiGypsy,"This app is helping me in so many ways I wouldn’t know where to begin. But I love it for so many reasons, I’ve felt 10x better since i’ve used it to my advantage, keeps me organized, gives me hope with any answers i need. It’s just amazing. Highly recommend for anyone who gets lonely as i do at times yet still has so many dreams but dk where to start to organize your life while trying to find yourself. Highly recommend."
5,App3553hg,"Great app, especially the AI cat… but so many great features to organize your like, goals, and to prioritize your wellbeing. I’m just delving in but it’s amazing. The music when I open the app instantly relaxes me like a spa. I feel this app will help transform aspects of my life for the better if I put the work in. I had a problem initially but the developer was kind, and customer centric and resolved it right away. Totally worth it—try it out and subscribe!"
5,Chqu33f,I’ve used a lot of mental health apps. Similar to Shmoody and slightly different. This is the one I keep coming back to. I like that it suggests different activities based on what I said my mood was. I like I can add my own  activities/tasks. Frequent user of the meditations. I’ve definitely got my moneys worth of this app. I’ve experienced two small bugs in my frequent use of the app but nothing to deter me from using it.
3,Alex.J.I,The routines and action plans are really great and helpful but the mood tracking doesn’t work at all. I was excited about this feature to have a better understanding of how my moods fluctuate throughout the week/month but I’ve had it say “looks like you’ve been in quite a good mood lately” when my last entry was miserable so it’s just really inaccurate and seems to be totally random. I think if that feature was fixed it would be more worth it but this app is definitely not worth paying for as is.
5,Grace570!,"This app has been helping me plan goals and even pre-writes text and emails for me sometime whenever I don’t know what to say. It gives guides on how to properly achieve my goals and be mindful. It offers check ins! I’m even considering getting the premium membership so that I can fully devote myself to this app! However, I feel that you don’t need to buy the premium subscription to enjoy this app and it’s benefits!"
5,Bdjdbjwbd,"I am a psychotherapist and I love utilizing technology to help my clients find ways to help themselves through life. I’ve tried several different mental health related apps with similar features, and I think this will quickly become one of my favorites to recommend. I feel there are enough free features to make it worth a try, and I’m excited to see what is added in the future!"
2,Tandy Tanderson,So I’ve been using this for about 2 months now. A lot of things in the app are marked “coming soon”. There’s frequently bugs. I have no idea why the daily points are tallied - there’s mention of a coming soon feature for how to spend the points too. I’m starting to wonder what the team is doing with the monthly subscription fees if they’re not releasing new features. If the coming soon things could actually get released I think I’d be really happy with it & would bump this up to a 4 or 5-star review. But I have to give 2 starts because right now it just has good potential.
5,Brandolphinn,"It’s kind of confusing to use… it’s a neat app but it’s not easy to navigate and set daily plans. For example when you set a plan to occur daily, it doesn’t restart daily, the same things stay checked off.. maybe I am doing something wrong but there’s not much for instruction. Edit: the bug has been fixed and the customer service is great. I recommend this app especially as an ADHD autistic adult."
5,Elias12kuip,"Marvelous and lovely! This application is worth it… Yes, I experienced a few glitches; however, the little cat that they use is extremely accommodating and extremely helpful! I adore this app, and I intend to keep it… I would like to praise the creators of this application for their amazing work and dedication… This is marvelous. I think everyone should get it. Period! End of sentence. Forever and ever amen! This is the app that you need.💕🌸"
5,ExpiredScroll76,"I’ve tried a few apps here and there to help me through my struggles but they didn’t quite get me going. shmoody just clicked instantly.  I love Guru Cat, the tools, the daily checklist, action plans, the joy calendar, the music, all of it. I’ve struggled wanting to be present and having the desire to move through the work it takes to get better and this little app has really been a game changer. ❤️"
5,Emily_chvz,"I usually am very good with keeping things on track since I’ve getting 4.0 all my life. Although, recently I took a lot more on my plate than I can handle so I haven’t been doing as well juggling everything. I’m so happy I saw an ad, and got the app. The app has a.i which happens to be very kind and fun to talk to. Well anyways in other words I wanna say thank you to the app producer because this app has really helped me!"
5,Big Tom sf,"Most of us already know to do these things when we are feeling “fine” it’s when I’m in my negative space that I don’t want to, or don’t know to, reach for these tools. This app brings it back to the basics. Easy? No. Nothing is easy when you’re in that space but this app allows you to do a little less thinking and get into a little more action. As my therapist says “eventually actions become emotions” this app helps with the actions."
5,AshasaurusRexasaurus,"I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental health issues for a while now, but Schmoody always seems to help me when I’m in a bit of a bind. I love the suggestions, support, and validation I get from this app! It’s not only helping me mentally, but it’s also helping with self growth and self love as well. If I could give this app more stars, I absolutely would. I deeply give my thanks to the creators of this app for a wonderful experience!"
5,alivyah713,This app reminds me to check in with how Im feeling and prioritize needs with enjoyable activities that make life worth living. I also enjoy the community feature where you can see how others are doing. I have Autism and ADHD and this is the only help organize app Ive ever consistently used. There are so many features like calming sounds and suggested text replies when you dont know what to say to ppl! So glad I found this!!
5,PunkVikar,"This app has changed the game for me! The free version so far is so good I’m most likely going to pay for the premium. I’ve gotten so much done, and have been able to really understand myself better in the process. I’m healing, and my house feels better!  Thanks so very much to the team that has changed my life with this app! -sincerely,  A very happy user!"
5,Reviewer 20353366,"I downloaded this app when I was having a difficult time organizing my life and finding ways to stay motivated. It’s now my fav place to be. I love the focus music, breathing exercises, and suggestions for daily tasks based on my mood. Using this app has inspired me to reduce my screen time and do the things that truly make me happy rather than staying stuck in negative thought patterns and feeling unmotivated."
4,corasorus,"I’ve only been using this app for a short while, but I absolutely love the idea of it and the features I’ve seen so far. I’m excited to be able to set goals and log my moods, and I love that everything is so personalized. The community section is great and there’s a space specifically for venting!  There are some glitches I’ve already noticed but nothing unfixable, just a little annoying. Overall pretty nice."
5,MelyfromSD,"I’ve had Shmoody for a few weeks. It has become crucial in logging my mood. I use the mood tracker and mood insights regularly. I love the calming sound options. I’ve used the sleep stories to fall asleep. I love chatting with Shmoody cat, it has helped tremendously. Seriously, it’s like talking to a wise bestie lol.  I use the life wheel and action plans to organize my life. I love the positive quotes. Overall, I enjoy this app. I became a lifetime member ✨"
5,Jenny#8675409:):):),This app is helpful i just started using it and have noticed a difference between my current mood when i am motivated in creating my day and checking off the activities that i do. Thanks 🙏🏼 it’s a great app for people that struggle with organized tasks it makes it easier to see what to focus on and is motivating me to get moving forward with my tasks. Thanks 🙏🏼 again.
5,arealdesperatehousewife,"Along with other mental health problems, I have ADHD and while I’ll admit this app does mess with my executive dysfunction a little, it seems to help with my depression and anxiety. It gives me something to look forward to and something to keep me accountable I guess. I haven’t used the community section yet, or the routine, or the joy list 😅 OK so I’ve only used the daily tasks and logged my mood— but that alone made the app worth it for me."
5,Crabby Amazon Seller,"I got the app to help with sticking to positive daily routines, and secondarily for binaural beat soundtracks. But my favorite feature I never expected to use and love is the Guru Cat chat bot. The conversations with Guru Cat feel natural and organic, and the cat understands and responds appropriately to complex topics. The advice has been helpful so far. Although I’m sure some issues require the help of real human therapists, Guru Cat is a great supplement for therapy. Plus, the feline personality is charming!"
5,Babu n Wishy,"I've only been doing this app for a day, but so far I like it. The cats are fun, of course. But, it's nice that it moves along at a quick pace so you earn validation for your tasks really quickly. At first, it seems silly. But, then, I'm finding that I'm getting excited to see that I'm earning more points for activities that I've done. It's fun when you've got some time to do it!"
2,alyssacdavis,"I wanted to love it… I really did. I did a ton of research on the mood tracking and daily habit app that would work for me, and settled on Shmoody. But unfortunately, it’s not working super well. I’m unable to add a single task to my daily list. I’m forced to completely re-do the whole list (who has the time?) I tried submitting this as a bug, but it wasn’t addressed. Additionally, I set some life goals only to find the next day that the section was completely gone? I already paid for premium for a year for an app I'm not even able to fully utilize. Disappointed."
5,Mochichic,I grew up with ADD and now ADHD as an adult its made things difficult on my daily lofe to get things done or start things that i always wanted to do. My mind is not organized and therefore i am disorganized  in my daily tasks. But this app makes it fun and easy to complete tasks and its also fun to look at. I recently became a cat momma so seeing their cute animated cats here and there is refreshing. 🥰 I am so glad I found this app.
3,SAM AND CAT R COOL,Many people don’t have the money to have a subscription! If you made it more accessible to people who can’t pay for it maybe people would stop being freaking depressed and unable to have a decent life without the stress of money! Please make the free trial feature on the AI chat free for everyone and not just for a week. It’s really unfair to people who cannot pay for everything and don’t have the money for a subscription!
2,Bug eyes with love13,"I loved this app, at first. I paid forty for the year long and yikes. There are so many bugs. Mood analysis doesn’t work, tasks don’t save, can’t see stats on your comments. Mood prediction score doesn’t work. They have a bug page to report bugs  but it doesn’t seem like they really read it, comments are there two months plus for THE SAME ISSUES!   I like the challenges and music, other than that there is a lot of work to be done. I’ll stick to headspace for now until they get all the bugs fixed ( making the app unusable!)"
5,apollo_kinetic,"So I had recently came across this app didn’t think anything of it until I started and kind of went through. Everything started feeling a little bit better. Got my first comment posted already got responses and I talked to the guru nothing but positive vibes felt very very good after talking, so yeah this is very amazing. I usually have a hard time talking should I give this app 100% amazing."
5,Mystic Advocado,"This app is really helping me stay on track. Also I am finding scheduling my fun activities for my day is teaching me how to balance my chores & fun restful time. I would go into a procrastination freeze mode & doom scoll. I deep cleaned my kitchen today & went to see a movie. 😳 I had my tasks all listed on the app & I went down & checked them off as I go. Feels amazing to be focused, productive & accomplished!  💓"
1,Shams Mahmoud,I understand that you have to “support the app” and programming through making some features premium only but the app is essentially unusable if you don’t pay the hefty subscription fee. Like at the point put up an ad or something and make adless a premium feature. These apps’ ultimate downfall is that they’re inaccessible to the general public who are already tied down by inflation and the recession. I had the app for less than a day because I found it so frustrating trying to make it work AT ALL. Do better.   Also the responses to honest reviews are kind of rude.
4,d12&de,"I like this app. I’m super surprised at how all in one Shmoody is. Mood tracker, habit tracker, routine builder, a whole community, etc, and I was only expecting some overpriced meditation app with very very limited features. Instead I get so much more and it’s fun. It actually helps me log in with answering the daily question and seeing my small progress from this week. When apps are useful and help me check on a daily, then I’m keeping it.  Thank you Shmoody 👏🏽😆"
5,elealuna,I was shooketh when I read the suggested actions saying I should pet my cat or read a book. That’s not productive!! I should change that out for clean something….but wait…”based on my mood” AHA!! I shouldn’t be cleaning I SHOULD PET MY CAT!! Such a simple thing but when you’re clouded by overwhelmed busy thoughts. It doesn’t even cross my mind. Thank you Shmoody for seeing what I need and not what I “think” I should be doing 💕🦄🥹
5,Shannon S.,"I love schmoody. It allows me to be able to track my moods and triggers, as well as setting small healthy goals/mood lifting interventions each day, and many other great resources, features and community. If you have any kind of issues with mood, anxiety, or any other kinds of stress this will be good for you. Best/funnest I have tried. I’m recommending to all my friends."
2,morgan mz,"Honestly think the app is great, just for the people who are willing to pay. Even with a lower price than many other services,  for someone like myself, its still not an option. I cant add a monthly subscription on top of school; even the yearly isnt something I can afford as just a one time payment. Its an unfortunate reality for many people and Im one of them. However, this app could be really beneficial to a lot people and I think if you have the funds, you should definitely try it."
1,bellaren,I decided to try the free trial as it said it would warn me when the 7 days was about up. I had clicked monthly installments as the option if I decided to go ahead with the app. I did try it for a few days and it wasn’t great. Very limited. Of course I forgot about it. There was no warning and then they charged me the full year instead of monthly. I emailed support and they were not helpful at all. The said I would need to get the refund from Apple apps? Apple said you’ll have to talk with the app.. feels a bit scamy to me. Plus the app is definitely not worth the money.
5,Llama 19?,"I was looking on the App Store looking for a good habit tracker, but this one was really nice cause I had cats and the way that the app was designed was really interesting for a person like me with anxiety and ADHD and help me organize what was going on and I’m continuing to help to with this app to get me through this year to my final year of high school I would definitely recommend it"
2,rhasodie,"A note to the developers — if you want women to use this app, you might want to curate your comedy section a little more. Many women who are depressed (and just many women) have experienced sexual assault and may be especially triggered on bad days by you recommending Bill Cosby and Louis CK at the top of your comedy list. There are plenty of comedians you could use to cheer people up without them.  I was excited by the otherwise gentle nature of this app, but that really shut me down when I was looking for something to cheer me up this evening."
5,Ebe🐝,I could honestly give the whole creative staff a big kiss of the forehead for this app. I can’t express how much it has helped with processing my own emotions and for allowing me a safe place to vent. I’m still amazed my how many features this app is packed with and am trying to incorporate more of it into my daily life but I can really see this helping anyone❤️
5,DeadpoolVenom,I am still new to the app but so far I am REALLY enjoying the app there is so much on here that can help you to keep your mind busy and your day organized. It lets you keep track of your mood throughout the day! The guru cat is like a little mini helper that gives you advice!! If I get more time on the app I will definitely write a better review!!
5,hcastagnozzi,"I am on my first day of Shmoody and so far I feel excited about it. It’s been easy & fun to navigate, and I think it’s cute. I am optimistic and confident about continued use and unlocking more levels! I like that it gives you points even for minimal use— that is encouraging and makes you feel like you have a small win."
5,Miatachicken,I have found this app to be very helpful in getting to a better place in my life. When things seem overwhelming having the planners to help keep me on track in doing things that are healthy for me has been great. I also like the breathing exercises and the guru cat chat. Those have helped me through some tough spots. Plus it’s cute!
5,Too hard to cancel,I started using this app late last night and was determined to turn my vibe around today. This app has helped me significantly today! Great checklists and goal setting and insights as well as a helpful hand built in to help you navigate your next steps when you need it.  I look forward to creating lasting healthy habits with this app!
5,jcm2606,"I think the gamification of some activities and the cute themes make this app worth a try. I am going through some rough times and my brain struggles to grab from the skills I know, so Schmoody helps by reminding me of the things I can do to feel better. I’m looking forward to do more with this cute app!"
3,RoseHyena,"I was doing really well with Shmoody when suddenly due to the last iPhone update a couple days ago, it was no longer recognizing my calendar. I thought maybe uninstalling and reinstalling the app might fix it but now no matter how many tries the app doesn’t wanna load and I get stuck in an infinite loading screen. Had to cancel my subscription because now I literally can’t get the app to open."
5,Jor-Jor da boss,"As a college student I find it hard to prioritize myself, and frequently get lost in the schoolwork and feel overwhelmed. This app has definitely brought me some simple pleasures I have often ignored. I like makings these lists, and getting messages from the app to remind me about my lists! I really enjoy the layout and absolutely love the little gifs!"
5,mellybeans22statenisland,I’ve been doing 50 jumping jacks because it was one of the things to do and it feels so good after. That’s the perfect amount to get your heart beating. But not too many as a beginner. And I am getting other things done like making sure I sit to drink my tea bc I do breathing exercises while I drink my camomile tea. It’s lovely. The app makes sure I do it
4,rocksanne ritchi,I love the idea of this app and most of its features. Obviously as a broke neurodivergent the pro/premium plan is out of budget but genuinely this app has all if not practically all of what I was looking for in a mood tracker/dopamine booster. I do wanna know what the points are for and I hope it isn’t entirely just for premium plan members bc the personal competition and novelty of it are what really make neurospicy people actually open the app.
5,AjLo524,I got excited after completing my Joy List! Being able to schedule things that bring me joy and have Schmoody suggest different items from my list while I’m building my daily list has been so nice. I often forget to take care of me and this app has helped me build these things into my day.
5,knorm2015,"Within just a couple days of having this app, I've been more productive, my husband also got the app, and our relationship has been better, including our communication skills! If your hesitating on this app or even paying for it, take this as a sign to do it! It will change your life"
5,Rawan Hazae,Taking time out my day on such a beautifully designed app is the highlight of my day ❤️ I’m using the free version of the app and the features are so nice…. The app itself is very calming and refreshing compared to other apps meant to help with anxiety and feelings in general.  10/10 perfect app please keep up the beautiful work 🤍
5,Sammiexo13,"This app made me feel like I was winning when life was showing me all the ways I was losing. It gave me a small victory for getting out of a deep dark place. I will forever be grateful for this app, and share to those who even may just need consistency. Thank you for making this app, its taken me so far already."
5,Poisoned Peaches13,"I am thoroughly enjoying this app so far, and even though I have not been using it long, I’ve noticed an improvement in my overall mood. I would absolutely recommend Shmoody if you have lots of stressors and have trouble trying to be positive like I did."
5,🎀jo🎀,This app absolutely helps even though I have only been using it for a while. From when you open the app you just feel a calm and inviting atmosphere. I am currently going through a lot of changes in my career and this app has help me rekindle with my hobbies and what makes life worth living.  Thanks so much Shmoody🫡🫶🏽
5,Phauxi,"I have really been going through it & struggle w/a few disorders, I’m a parent, GF, & student…I’m so upset that I didn’t open this app sooner because I picked up my phone, started going through the app, ironically my mood did improve & I haven’t stopped looking through the app yet! Super easy way to track moods & habits! Thanks!!!!"
3,kirbiele,"The app features are helpful, particularly the action plan. I struggle to check in with myself and take time to decompress, so having little reminders to do something nice for myself is great. The one thing that’s bugging me is that the music will start playing randomly while the app is closed. Like I’ll be texting someone or checking my email and the music will suddenly start playing without an accompanying notification."
2,fromlovetohate,"Think it’s kind of messed up to force people to pay for a mental health app (profiting off of depression guys, cmon), and especially because it’s clearly still in early development — super expensive and it’s glitchy, doesn’t allow more than five actions in a routine, and the interface is pretty ragged and laborious. Can you tell I just forgot to cancel my free trial and now I’ve paid $50 for only a years subscription when I don’t think it’s even worth $20 for life."
5,EmTeeSpoon,"I’m a 43 year old man, on my second marriage, and I’m autistic, adhd, and I have severe CPTSD, BPD, anxiety, depression, and diabetes. This app makes me feel better about me and my life, it’s helping me grow. Frankly, I’m glad I found it. PS I believe this is my actual first review on iOS, so that should tell you something about this app."
5,Kettar,"I love this app. It makes me have a little smile when get depressed. A friend who understands your everything is alwyas the the best one to have. “However” they do not be with us all the time when we get depressed, and I think this app might be a good alternative. It will tell what to do to cheer you up, which was supposed to be told by our friends."
3,emilya246,"Good idea and I do find the routine checklist helpful, but the app is so buggy and slow that it’s infuriating to try to build or edit a routine. The interface is not intuitive at all. Opening the app takes longer than it should too, especially if you’re checking in multiple times a day to check items off your list. I’m annoyed that I paid this much for a poorly designed app."
4,Livi0229,Love this app for being accountable on myself with daily tasks and a personalized plan. It feels like there are quite a few quirks. I wish my personal plan would start over each day whether I finished all the tasks or not. But the community board they have where you can make recommendations and see what they are working on makes me super hopeful!
5,christian gal19,"Update - had a good experience with customer service, so I wanted to make sure and update this. Was easy to get a refund once I found the support button!   I canceled my free trial. I have screenshots. But they charged me for a subscription anyway. I never authorized the charge. I want a refund. How do it get one?"
5,Daisypop,I feel like this app was geared just for me. I was struggling to get up and move every morning but the satisfaction of checking off a task is so much fun! I do a lot more and love seeing the new tasks! The community is amazing! I have always wanted to vent about being bipolar and how that has changed my everyday life. I am so grateful for this app!
5,Ryles817,I am new to this app they got me pulled in with the cat lovers. I haven’t been able to tap into the full potential yet as I’m still exploring but I do love it.  The team interacts with the user. They are so kind and want this app to meet everyone’s needs. Mike has been so supportive. I am looking forward to using this more.
5,Lilalekat,"I really really love and enjoy this app! It is super supportive, like a friend that I never knew I needed. It checks in on me, has me to define goals, the steps to accomplish the goals, and more. I love the background music, the app style, the lil characters, it takes me from my world. Thank you to the team that created this awesome app!"
2,Gliiitchy,"This app wasn’t for me; I found that the plans it created weren’t enough to break me out of low cycles or motivate me, and that’s ok! That’s what trials are for.   What ISNT ok is a mental health app marketed at people that may be neurodivergent or mentally ill monetizing using a timed trial that automatically converts to a $40 yearly subscription if you don’t cancel within 7 days.   There are other demo and pricing structures that would better serve your audience without preying on the “forgot to cancel” crowd, which is something mental illness can make you more prone to.   I fully support paid apps, recognize the costs that it takes to develop and support apps, and want the developers to earn a living wage. However, it is possible to do so without taking advantage of the group your app aims or claims to help."
5,Nicoleelaineee95,I am actually loving this app I am having so much fun just talking about things with people on it I love the every day questions. I tend to get into a rut of just not talking to anyone but close family for weeks on end and it has really helped me actually get out and have someone to talk too.
4,Princeeslisa,This has worked SO much better than traditional therapy. Currently my husband has serious medical issues and I am unable to go to face to face therapy.    The app keeps me honest and on track everyday.  The Chat CatBot even gives me warm fuzzies when I need it. Everything is in one simple app that I can use at my own pace with gentle reminders along the way. I love it!!!
1,jesusdabz,"I keep seeing apps for addressing mental health issues but they are all subscription based apps. I feel they should be free with an option to donate. If they actually help i would donate to the developers because i have tried a few apps like this and they didnt help at all and the developers still got my money, which shows them the app “works” when in reality it didnt in the slightest. These kind of apps are just capitalizing on people with mental health issues with bots writing positive reviews"
5,nobody1234567,"The features of this app are really thoughtful and helpful. The nature sounds could use a bit of improvement to sound more realistic, but everything else I’ve tried is great, and the obvious care that went into making this makes me happy to use it."
5,SarahDeeeeee,"So many of these apps want to ask me a thousand questions which is the last thing I feel like doing when I’m depressed. This app cuts straight to the point of what can I do right now to make myself feel better. Also, they have memes, which I think is awesome."
5,Jvernicealix616,"I really like this app so far. I first was introduced through my school since they partnered with them. So far everything has been easy but helpful, having ways to talk and steps to improve my daily life. I really needed this as I’ve dealt with a lot recently so I’m grateful to have it."
5,ccyetilove,"I love this app. It’s boosting productivity like crazy, helping with insights and making interacting with my to do list, self care and mood shifting fun and interesting.  It’s also very cute and sweet and has a ton of interesting content and features. Seriously can’t speak highly enough. It’s worth a shot!!!"
5,NomDecris,"the user interface is customizable based on how you want to use the app, so you aren’t sifting through modules that aren’t helpful for your goal. it makes it so much easier to keep up with routines and other ideals you’re working towards."
5,Yamilet77,I like that during the day it gives me an opportunity to stop and take a breathe or remind me I’m doing a great job. Some days are very difficult and I find it a little easier when you have reminders during the day that we are not alone struggling with our mental health.
5,Iz Zy instagram:guineapig9651,"I seen an add for it and loved it. Got it and I could never get past the “Get personalized recommendations” screen I’m so sad, I even tried to delete it and get it again- it didn’t work then So just beware that it might not work for you, and don’t get your hope up like I did 🫠😔"
5,Eepycat2211,"I never write reviews, but I really recommend Shmoody. My therapist has noticed a huge improvement in my ability to cope between sessions. It’s really helped me. It’s NOT a replacement for therapy, and I appreciate the app being open about talking to your therapist about all your needs. Thank you devs!"
1,MMMMMMMMMMMMM,"I’m very glad I canceled my free trial before being charged for the overpriced subscription service on this app. It seems to think I’m clinically depressed based on my “phone usage” (no other details provided) and today it started randomly playing music three different times. Couldn’t figure out where the music was coming from and had to shut down all apps to find the source. And then even though I didn’t reopen the app, it played music by itself again. Deleted. Skip this one."
5,Mmsj1217,"This app is a surprising gem! I love that it is simple to use and has a positive spin that doesn’t feel fake or annoying. The coaching is the best I’ve heard, a calm voice and really great tips. I love all the great suggestions for creating a daily action plan that are fun!!! And the sleep stories are the BEST!!! Thank you for this app!!!"
5,Veronica.M.Dillon,"This app helps me organize the plans I talk about with my therapist. Sometimes it is hard to execute something without it being written down or planned out in front of you. Especially as a working college student, this is a life savor. It helps me stress a little less and be productive."
5,Becki63,"I don’t currently have a therapist, but this app gives me someone to share my thoughts with and it gives me thoughtful and relevant advice and feedback about my problems! It’s like having a therapist right in my phone! Keep up the good work!!!"
5,ArrogantBarstool,"I downloaded Shmoody when my mental health was really low, as a tool to help outside if therapy. I figured i’d try the free trial & delete it afterwards, but it’s been so helpful, i bought a year’s subscription. I use Shmoody daily, to track highs and lows, get insights outside of therapy, etc. very helpful little cat"
5,Warrior Catzzzzzzz 😺,"I have used handfuls of apps that never really helped me, but I can tell a difference in my thoughtfulness, mood, and productivity GENUINELY from this app. I rarely if ever leave reviews but this one is worth it, and it’s definitely worth the subscription for additional resources. I absolutely love it!"
4,Zxskulls,"It’s a great app! The only thing I wish worked a little smoother was creating custom action plans for yourself. Every time you try to edit one, it’s starts creating a new plan instead of just adding something specific to the one you have so that can be a little frustrating but overall, I’m keeping it!"
5,JayRyah,I didn’t expect much from this app but it has exceeded my expectations! I love the tools and music it provides. I listen to their peaceful music tracks when I’m falling asleep or doing yoga asana. The check list is great and motivates me to be productive in healthy ways. I see myself using this app for a long time! <3
5,spicyhotnipplechop,"I’ve been using this app for only a day. It influences good emotions and routines, gives you good tools to look inside yourself and emotions. The community is so amazing and supportive and makes you feel like your not alone in your struggles. I highly suggest this app is just amazingly beneficial."
5,cheechwanda,"Shmoody is a fantastic app for mood tracking and mental wellness. Its user-friendly interface, insightful analytics, and personalized tips have been incredibly helpful in managing my emotions. The gentle reminders keep me consistent, and the customizable entries let me capture my mood's nuances. Highly recommend!"
1,Lulumiel,"I canceled on the 7th day of the free trial because I didn’t use it like I thought I would; it wasn’t on my memberships through iPhone! BEWARE!. I don’t like that music plays every time the app opens. I tried to contact customer service support to ask for a cancellation, it opened once to view step by step ask and after the app reported and error and wouldn’t load. I had to close the app to open anything at all. I’m reaching out to my bank to have them refund me, don’t download it!"
1,ramenlovr,"Was looking forward to use this for anxiety and just to overall build a better daily routine. Of course, after going through the sign up process, you can only start a 7 day free trial or pay upfront for a membership. Just so sick of having to pay for literally everything these days…why can’t we make cool resources like this for free?  Don’t recommend at all and after reading other reviews, I wouldn’t want to waste my money on this anyways."
5,V2Cubed,"This app had me a tad bit leery. I was not positive that it was going to lift any bad mood of mine, but just one visit to the app, and I’m hooked. I like it a lot. It’s too early too tell if it will continue to be used as often as some of my other apps, but only time will tell."
3,KRFewell,This app would be on top of the charts if you offered the free version always. If you’re needing to make money then add some exclusive parts but the routine and habit builders and mood tracker are an essential reason why I downloaded it. This app has so so much potential hidden behind an ad wall. I’m going to prosper off this app while I can still use it.
5,LeiHancox,"I’d say definitely try this out, be patient and open to it and just get it done because the points are motivational and just fun all the while learning about yourself and getting motivated!! You’ll be glad you tried!"
5,Do Good Shop,"Shmoody has truly helped me build a routine. As someone who struggles (a lot!) to stay on task and not get distracted by many other things, this app has kept me in check!  I tried many “to do” apps but this one wins, HANDS DOWN!  Highly recommend!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
5,Amilya Stroud,Just started using this a few hours ago. I promise you if you stick with it and even do the simplest task you will feel a change. I have desired goals I want to reach but it’s also so good at helping you calm down and bringing you to center.
1,Ccppahj,"I am unable to create and save a custom plan that’s repeating. Does this mean I need to create an individual plan every day? What’s the point of the app then? Literally no point to the app, as someone with ADHD I would not recommend it and it left me frustrated and annoyed trying to figure out anything, the tutorial is lack luster. Everything is super mid and it’s expensive. It’s really just a social media app disguised as tool to help. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ADHD unless you are trying to frustrate yourself."
5,Ashleigh B!,"It’s only been 2 days of using this app so far and i’ve already learned so much. The information given is useful and easy to apply to my every day life. You have to want it, but this is a great tool to help better yourself."
5,MarbledSkies,"I’m ADHD, OCD with severe anxiety and bi polar. I love people but I stay exhausted. Anxiety keeps me lonely and when I am social it drains me. This app keeps me busy and it feels like I’m texting someone, on my time and no one gets offended by my lack of response. Highly recommend, also God helps 💜"
5,RebeccaRogue23,Have only been using a couple weeks but has already helped me focus on daily routine that I often procrastinate and think more about than doing it. Also like meditation and sound features.
5,AplhaFemale,Love the app but I’m not sure I can continue to pay to use it and that makes me sad because this app is really cool and I know it could help me and be a life changer for me right now but I wish there could be some free access to certain features. 🫶🏻
3,starblue332,"I signed up for the free trial. Went through all of the set up stuff, made a to do list and a joy list and a joy calendar. I got zero reminders or anything all day. Opened the app to check more things off and it acted like I had done nothing. Made me choose my color again. Enter how old I am again. List my reasons and goals again etc."
5,Kaylechip,I love this app!! It has greatly helped me improve my mental health and has made me take a few minutes and reflect on how I feel throughout the day. I also love the panel section where people write motivational quotes!! So much better than doom scrolling on Instagram
2,Starlight494,"Is there not a way to bypass the premium page that requires you to pay? I redownloaded the app after more than a year, and as I was setting it up, it took me to the plan page I could not bypass. I wanted to try the app again after not using it for years. Since there was no option to get past this set-up without paying $40, I immediately deleted the app."
4,Zeinmira,"Honestly thought this app would be a sham, but it’s really well made and seems to have a lot of features that’ll help me improve. On day one of the free trial it doesn’t feel gimmicky.   One but I’m noticing — there doesn’t seem to be a way out of a profile screen. I accidentally tapped on it and couldn’t get out."
5,Firtnitefan,"Genuinely just a nice app. You get the feeling that they know what bad days are like, and really want to help people out. It has tons of calming audios like soundscapes and binaural beats (very interesting, no?) You can post about your day in probably the most supportive community online. Just a nice app."
5,getbettertoo,"This app is great for moments when you’re down, need a community to connect with, and maybe some routine to help get you the the day. I also really like the binaural beats when I’m trying to wind down."
5,HappyShopperPiper,This app has helped me notice my life. That sounds extreme I know but seriously thank you so much to whatever channel I saw this app on because the past three days have been so much better for me than what I’ve been doing!!!
1,Annoyed at Subscriptions,"My depression is related to money, and this awful capitalist wasteland we are being hammered again, again, and again with everything wanting us to sign up and pay money.  You *must* sign up for a paid subscription to even trial the app for 7-days.  At least add the ability to at least trial the interface and features before forcing users to sign up, thanks."
5,jmar646,Straightforward and easy to use. Provides simple tasks to help you feel better. Really like the community aspect as I believe that’s essential to growth and recovery. Looking forward to challenging myself with some of the upcoming events. Social media detox should be interesting!
5,claudy_claud__,I really enjoy this app. I was scared that it was going to make me pay and I wasn’t going to be able to do anything else. It’s very fun and takes it slow so I don’t have to feel overwhelmed all at once.
5,SalRaebae,"I have a very stressful busy life as a mom with twins and a toddler, I’m constantly stressed out and struggling, this app reminds me to slow down and take a minute and helps me take care of myself, thank you 💗"
5,iditabad,"Cute, nice, fun, helpful, and not trying to rip you off. Honestly it’s a useful app for managing some things about ADHD and habit building. I’ve found it to be really useful to give me a cute little checklist I can celebrate each morning. It starts the day off nice."
3,juju0000$,"As somebody who struggles with anxiety and depression daily my entire life i thought id give the app a try but i don't think i really will make you feel better unless you pay for all of the features, which aren’t a bad price, but im not paying. much love i love what they are trying to do with this app though its fantastic"
5,dcbakes,As a teen I've really just been stressed with school parents and my recent breakup and this app has not only helped me with my stress and anxiety but my out look on the day and being excited for life again.
5,stopppppp1,I’ve been using this app for a couple of days now with the free version. So far I like it! It’s easy to navigate and use. I may purchase if I feel the free version isn’t enough. Try it out! There’s nothing to lose!
3,Queen Elizibeth II,"Just stated the app up, and when it asked me if i was a collage student, i picked no, then it asked me to say how old i am, and the continue button won’t light up or allow me to press it. I went out of the app, and tried clicking i was in college, and it still  won’t let me pick my age. Am i doing something wrong?"
5,MustardSeedPromises,I have been using this app for almost four months now and am enjoying the benefits of it.  Thank you for making this tool for those of us who are struggling to get stuff done!  God bless you! ✝️🙏🫶🏻
5,Lo_xoxo24,I’m really enjoying this app so far. I’m definitely someone that gets satisfaction of crossing things off my to do list causing me to be more productive throughout the day. I’m excited to see how this app can help me evolve into the best me.
5,Ally2721,This is the first app I’ve used that makes me feel better and more efficient. I have noticed my mood improving and I highly recommend trying it out!
5,AidanDay,"Honestly I’ve downloaded many of these apps over 4 years, I liked none of them enough to use them. This is honestly a welcome surprise. I’m very motivated to fulfill my goals, and the cat guru is actually amazing. I utilize it so often."
5,@kelslife124,This app is so cute but it is really effective! It gives you that small pat on the back when you need it and encourages you to do that yourself. When you’re stuck or just overwhelmed it’s such a great help! I love this app!
5,dirtgirl2000,i’ve never seen a decent mood tracking app and i like all the features and this is an app i’m actually willing to pay for. thank u for making this app. may u fight with the strength of 10 grown men
5,Iejujubee,This is such a soothing app that meets you where you’re at. I love how you can craft goals and routines in bite size pieces that actually get you where you want to be. I feel more in touch with myself and grounded.
5,CLeCrone,"Although I am just learning this App, I love it! It’s keeping me on track of productivity! The simplest things I forget to do so this is so helpful. I feel amazing completing tasks! I feel a lot better when Im having to deal with my ADHD! Bravo Shmoody!"
5,Cophermom,"There are multiple different tasks that assist you in your day to day life that can help you live YOUR personal best life, individualized to YOU!  Helps you be more motivated, more joy seeking!"
5,AZ pig girl,"It is super supportive during hard times and whenever I’m not able to tell anyone how I feel due to certain situations being a lot for the people around me coping, it really helps me"
3,itreeeallylydoesn'ttmatterrr,"they need to fix this bug. I find the app charming and potentially useful but I’ve been forced to redo the onboarding every time I’ve opened the app. What’s also unusual is that it remembers the data I previously input but still asks for the same information again, this is really irritating."
1,aleveryday,If the app is good and works it doesn’t need to try to trick people into paying as much as possible.  Why not allow a trial for monthly subscription? It’s only because they want you to forget and have it roll over into a $40 plan.  At that point they make the most money from people forgetting to unsubscribe and it’s too late.  Don’t trust health and wellness apps that pull this kind of thing. Money is the primary focus.
5,kelseeeeeyyyyyy,I only a few steps in but I feel like if I commit to this more than my other phone apps I will see a lot of healthy mental improvement. Willing to find out.
5,CravingImpulse,"Honestly,, I never write review, good or bad. But the ideas for this app are amazing. And the features included even just in the free version are expansive. I really appreciate this app helping me build myself back together again."
5,Zoe Santerre,I love this app because it’s so easy to use and I love creating an action plan. Whenever I’m feeling down I never think about what to do to make myself feel better so this app is a great help. Highly recommend
5,dj beast ziggy crisp,"I think the part I love best about this app is chatting with guru cat. It’s weird how much it helps me. It’s always positive advice, and it helps to release some bad thoughts going through my head when I’m really going through it."
5,Spark plug girl,This is actually a fun app to use and the interactive chat really feels like a real person talking back to you like it’s truly listening and to what you’re saying and giving real feedback
5,ZoeMod,This helps with daily things I often forget to do. It also helps me check in with myself and keep myself on track for small goals.
1,Free trial ended,"I was told I would be warned when my free trial was coming to an end, but was not and was charged the annual fee rather than the monthly fee. This app is also quite buggy, like for example right now it is making me go through the introductory questions every time I open it. It’s got some good ideas, but is massively overpriced and does not feel good that it did not warn me when I was told it would."
1,"nicknames are stupid, pass","That’s mostly what this app is, a check list to remind people to do stuff, with a few features like relaxing sounds thrown in as well. All of this can be done with the default apps on your iPhone, so this software has nothing new to offer. It’s a waste of money, making lists and stuff helps all lot but you don’t need to pay an outrageous price for that kind of tool."
4,Eminememzz7,"From someone who never writes a review it’s great. Even without paying it’s not bad! I have some of my own problems, (personal) It keeps my mind busy and I get to reflect on myself which I have hard times with. Great job on this app! Love the colors and set up as well😌"
1,BiancaHernn,"Shamoody SCREWED me over, did test trail to see what’s up, I didn’t even have app for  1 week, I canceled the subscription through the app, through my Apple setting’s, & through the App Store settings, they WONT stop trying over & over & over to take money from my Apple wallet,  I’ll post screenshots of my Apple Wallet with APP name under it from how they keep trying to take my money. Extremely Frustrating!!! Save yourself"
4,Applematt23,I really like this app in the few days I have used it. I already feel better! I am a little frustrated with the ability to create daily or weekly tasks lists. I’d like the ability to edit already made lists to make it easier.
5,Crabmaster32,There are days when the tasks come at me so fast that my head gets dizzy. No more managing! I am ready to thrive :). Thanks Shmoody for getting me structured and putting a soundtrack to my daily activities.
5,this is a scam company,"I’m not much of an app guy but a friend recommended and so far I’m kind of blown away. Simple simple little things to improve your perspective, I can see how they can really help my day or over time"
1,Zomondo,"The location within this MOOD TRACKING  app to LOG YOUR ACTUAL MOOD is the best HIDDEN feature in the app.  So, I deleted the app, and rated it one star.  I can't record my mood in a mood tracking app.  Make an app to track your mood; hides location of mood recording somewhere deep inside app.  Don't wonder why you're getting one star.  I can't log my mood in a mood app.  You have failed miserably at making a mood app."
5,zombiekitty666,I just got this app at 3 something in the am. Wasn’t too sure about it but I can see a lot went into making this app. I’m hopeful it’ll help me get thru whatever I’m going thru. We’ll see…….
5,Ccmitch14,This is only my first day using this but so far I’m excited to see how this can work for me. I like the idea of setting a calendar to do more of the things you love.
5,moonchildash07,I’ve been looking for a cheap habitat app that gives me help creating and maintaining task (ADHD) the fact that they suggest steps to complete everything is great. I’m really enjoying this app and will be purchasing it!
5,Miss Zaleigh,"This is the most helpful and uplifting app I have used to date. It has everything you need to build healing routines, an amazing community to vibe with & even an AI cat to chat with when you need to vent! Thank you so much for this!!"
4,angelfire75,"Lots of things I like about the app . But, some things like having no clue what to do with the points if there is anything you can do with them has me a bit perplexed."
5,Greeneyedstorm,"I’m enjoying the Shmoody app. It’s creative, fun and starting to help my mood. It keeps me occupied and to think about something else than what I’m going through. I just started in the app but I’m feeling hopeful."
5,djs1986,"I truly feel like this app has everything I need to allow me to take control of my mental health. It recommends exercise/activities, feel good movies, helpful podcasts, and simple approaches to dealing with mental health issues."
5,Itskekereview,"It’s so relaxing to have this app. From the music to the fonts, and colors. It actually makes you think about your goals and what you want to do in life."
5,Sonic Feet,"As someone with anxiety and depression, I find this app to be impressively comprehensive. The mood predictor helps me to remember the big picture as opposed to getting caught up in one bad day and it’s nice to be rewarded for practicing self care :) will totally recommend"
5,as boogie,I love this app I wish I didn’t have to pay for it to use this amazing app something like this app would be great to have for free for everyone to beable to us in even in time of need how ever that may be
5,IG: newmetaaesthetic,"I haven't gotten to use it too much yet but, from what I’ve seen so far, its pretty intuitive! I like how it works with you to build a custom plan. I’m excited to see results unfold with continued use! 👍🏼"
1,MiaBugzBake,"This app is trash. Customer service doesn’t exist. And they keep hiding my reviews which is utter TRASH. But I will keep posting everywhere about my horrific experience with this app trying to steal money from me that I never agreed to. So go on & keep deleting or not posting my reviews, I will post EVERYWHERE ELSE. Trash trash trash trash, throw this whole app & everyone involved with it in the TRASH. Now, let’s see the snarky developer’s response 🙄🙄…"
5,"Your friend, Russ",I’ve been using Shmoody for over a year now and it’s helped me be more active on days when I feel trapped in my room. Really glad I found this app.
5,watermelongurlwithtjegoodhair,I feel like this app really relates to me. And the different most they have really helped simplify and Declutter my life. It helped me gain routine. Most of its functions are free which makes it the best for me. Caters to my needs. And it just helps freshen my mind!
3,memegand,"I wish this worked better. It’s a great concept and platform but the app is super glitchy, doesn’t save your progress, and consistently does not update your action list each day. Wish they would improve!"
5,BDext08,"I love this app! It helps me refocus when I sometimes start to feel myself spiraling. This, and a great therapist, have made my 2023 better than it might have been. Thank you Shmoody!"
5,kjeaux,My app- when I open it has just a white screen and says It can’t connect to the server. Really enjoying the App and would hate to lose my progress. :( help!
5,Preciousgina13,I just got on this app been looking for an enter active on for a long time and have come confidential help as well. Thus far this tips a lot of the others
5,1092TC,"I had an argument set me back with a trauma flashback and was barely functional. In just a few days, the app has helped improve..."
5,rob leone,I really enjoy the random suggestion feature and the guided meditation. This app plus a little bit of willingness goes a long way to help change my mood! Thank you!!!!
2,redcantelope,"Two minutes in their 'quick start' and found it was impossible to grab a premade action plan and easily edit it.   I want to rearrange the order and delete one item. Why have I been to multiple ""edit"" areas and not been able to find that option?"
5,MindyBKD,"As I come to know the app, it is interesting to see where Schmoodycat takes me. I’m glad to see so many different happy places and joy spots loaded.  Good variety!"
5,swaynice,I love this app I’ve been really depressed and drained lately but the little jokes and tips literally brought a tear to my eye (happy tear) thank you I just wish the app was free ATM for personally reasons but you guys deserve every penny.
5,lttledove03,I like everything about this app but I would like it even more if we could respond to comments on our posts.
5,mittenzzzzzzzz,"I’m fairly new here, but this app is absolutely adorable and it’s a great way to stay consistent and keep up with the little things that make you happy.  Great price, too!"
5,nahni444,"The breathing exercises and the graphics and the activities, have me sold.. I truly feel better and motivated and some relief 🥲"
5,lukensmomma1.,"So far, this app has really helped me on my healing journey. Making me dig deeper than i thought. I would highly recommend, especially for a big starting place."
5,Liney25,"Thank you so much, Shmoody team! I love that I can be multiple moods at a time and on a day. This app really gets it if you want honest information"
5,Carinims01,"I love that you can create day by day plans to help you. I can’t afford the premium version, but I like that they offer different breathing exercises too."
2,Holzmeow,I downloaded the app to begin a free trial. Features of the app were hard to use or they would never load. I would have liked a better walkthrough of the app and how to use/set up features. All of these made me want to cancel the trial as even my initial experience was confusing or unusable.
5,Chasethatkayla,"I will update this after I’ve used the app for more than a month. So far, I am really enjoying the features, and digging a little deeper into my emotions."
5,sea_queen,"Seems like a good app, hate being bombarded with “buy the upgraded version” so that kinda stinks but I think I can ignore it since so many apps do that"
5,Sjvalleygrl ,I love this app! I have ptsd and a bunch of other fun issues and Shmoody is so helpful! The AI replies are so responsive and knowledgeable. This replaced a different app I used for years. And Shmoody is affordable!! I love it. Thank you to the creators.
5,lollipopdays,You guys need a widget option!!  I have so many apps I forget y’all exist tbh. I only check in because I bought the yearly thing but I wouldn’t have if I hadn’t.
4,jfkndhndn,"Im planning on only doing the free trial, but as I’ve used it, it’s amazing. The features it offers helps to feel a lot better if you had a bad day."
5,MaCaitL,"There are all kinds of cool things to dig into in this app. I really like the mediation tool, you pick your time commitment and it guides you through a quick (or not, depending on what you picked!) mediation."
2,Shell_89,"I loved the idea and layout of this app! I was so excited because I need this in my life..But now I’m kind of bummed because I started the process and you have to agree to some sort of subscription plan after 7 day trial..  I have sooo many medical bills, and  I am on a fixed income so unfortunately I’ll have to uninstall it 🥺"
5,KellySTclaire,This is the first mental health amd habits app that I am actually using. I’ve already made improvements in my daily activities and daily joy. I highly recommend this app!!
5,babybluegoku,This is exactly what everybody needs. This is exactly how data needs to be used. Come on! Wow I believe in this app and trust my word is bond. I’m forever grateful to be alive and expression is what keeps me going
5,Aylward5,I was recommend to use this application when I struggled with my mental health in 2020! In 2016 I had issues with depression and anxiety. I worked with a therapist that used cognitive behavioral therapy. This app reminds me of that technique and it does wonders! Couldn’t be happier 😃
5,looneychickeroo,I downloaded the app earlier and I’m having fun setting it up. I can already feel it working and I haven’t even started yet
5,jetzbet,Nice app. I like the options for goals and tasks. They are definitely geared towards my issues and helps me take care of myself.
5,Kaylkayo,Shmoody Cat is fun and supportive. Very well done and thought through with care. I am excited to keep learning about the different features!
1,angry discord mod,"The app worked perfectly fine when i first opened it after downloading. I then tried to create my ""action plan"" and every time i would hit ""customize"" the app would just close. I wouldn't consider anyone to download this app, considering it doesn't function properly."
5,Cmayner,It understands and communicates like a very insightful person. It has helped me so much and understand myself better.
5,Cuddlefishiz,"I love this app so far.  I have some personal things I would like to correct as far as how I use my time.  Since I am a cat lady, this app really speaks to me."
5,Misslogan,I just started using it but I already am enjoying it. Very personable & I truly feel like I’m having a unique experience.
1,JPEGs mother,I actually cancelled my trial and then got charged the next day for an annual subscription. Pretty scammy if you ask me. They make it extremely hard to get a refund. The interface is absolutely too overwhelming and not at all helpful for someone like me with ADHD who likes clean lines and simplicity. There’s far too many choices to make and it’s way too corny for my tastes.
5,Weasleyish,"The AI component of this app makes it so useful and honestly helpful in the moment. I’ve tried so many apps, but this is the ONE that has it all. 🩵✌️"
5,PerfectYellowFlash,I absolutely love this app! I don’t know how to explain it but it makes me excited to plan my day and it has so many tools I didn’t even know I needed or loved. 💝
5,Mimi!! :3,I’ve been struggling with school and stress and even tho I just got this it has helped a lot and I’m definitely gonna keep using this!!
5,chaseingadream,"I’m on the 7 day free trial and I’m going to make the investment, the app has modes that can help you navigate easily and a chat that’s very helpful! I’m on day one and loving it!"
2,ScS1019,"This has good potential but the UI is just horrible and actually to the point that it deters me from using the app. Wish the developer could make it more neutral, simple, and easy to navigate. Switched over to Tiimo solely for the UI. If this changes, I’ll switch back."
5,Shmoodygurl,I see how much fun and creative this app is compared to other mental health apps and it’s so helpful giving options for new ways to stay productive with a fun app
4,ea.murph,"I’ve only just started using this but I love it. I love the music it plays, the meditations, the guru cat, the UX is fabulous. I have to keep playing around with it to see if it tracks all that I want with it! TBD soon!"
5,Livie M.,This app does a fantastic job of understanding the need to bring comfort into someone’s atmosphere. This comes from the relaxing background music to the easy set up.
5,Spicy Tex,"I’m really loving this app!  It’s a great way to start your day.  It helps me start my day/weekend with positive goals that ultimately lead me to a positive mood. The daily challenges are just what I need to feel accomplishment and satisfaction .  Check out the standup, movie or podcast recommendations  Spot on choices for whatever your mood is.  This app is very user friendly and really fun.  I highly recommend for everyone!"
1,LWI was,"Apps should have to say upfront, BEFORE you download, if they are only offering a free *trial,* so we don’t have to waste our time downloading, answering a bunch of questions, and only then finding out the cost. As it stands the only way to find out what it actually costs is to do all that crap, then delete & start over with a different app."
5,Disciple86,"I like how you get guided through step by step, it’s not stressful this way"
5,Sami Upton,I think this is one mental health app that I actually like ! I actually want to use it and that makes a difference!
5,Blondevoldoll,I love this app! It’s helped with my mental health and organization skills and to find the small things that make me happy and the community is such a gift.
2,cupcakeluver2122,"overall i’m quite fond of this app, but the overwhelmingly frequency with which i encounter bugs always puts a damper on my mood. i often times exit the app feeling frustrated that i paid $40 for a yearly subscription when it is sometimes borderline not functional…..especially considering how many other probably more polished apps there are available offering similar features. if i wasn’t paying a subscription fee, i would certainly be less critical. i expect more when it’s $40 a year though, that’s for sure."
1,simplelife20212,I saw there were reviews where people were trying to customize action plans where the app kept crashing. The developers responded saying the bug was fixed. This happened to me repeatedly today. Never successfully made the plan. App not working ended up stressing me out more. Deleted the app and cancelled subscription.
5,FunnyGirl07,"I love all the extras offered by this app, it’s fun while soothing and helpful. While I can’t afford the full version at the moment the free trial was extremely enlightening!! 🍃💨🍃🍃🌳🧘🕉️🩷"
5,kaylaamor,there’s people who relate.. this helps me find comfort especially when i feel like i have nobody people understand you here
2,Gdtvdryiteghfv,"Wanted to try this, but could not get past the “allow us to check which ads you’ve seen” step during set up. Tapping the next button does not seem to do anything. I like the music and what I have seen of the UX so far though."
5,ciarasstarr,I love this app because it combines my biggest struggles and helps me work through them in a positive manner. plus there’s cats everywhere 🥰
1,silverose13,"Nowhere in the app description does it say that this is a paid subscription only app, with no free parts of the app. You think you’re downloading a free app then get asked to start a one-week free trial that will automatically charge you after 7 days are up. That’s called a bait and switch, and is false advertising."
5,Lannah0808,"One feature I adore about this app is how aesthetically pleasing it is. It’s easy to use, and the guide/instructions are very helpful."
5,tmccall06,I just got the app but so far I love it! The cats are really cute and entertaining. The Smoody cat is responsive and helpful. It’s like a fun little game. I will update this in a week
5,Drmoban,"I just downloaded the app. So far, Its been doing a great job of giving me a run down of how to navigate it, and reminding me that its for my betterment."
5,Nicolerivers24,Really have enjoyed this app. the insight and response back is great still discovering things about it even using it on day that are good
5,HoJoScho2023,Just simply creating a JOY List makes me realize that I do find joy in dozens and dozens of activities and it’s great to have a reminder of that and self-care routines. I love this!!
5,Cgurs,Wonderful and cute app. It’s beautify organized and extremely helpful. The pacing is easy to incorporate into my daily schedule. The messages are easy to digest and the art is very cute!!
5,Christopher___12,Already calmer and looking forward to getting help with tasks and goals
5,金毛毛JT,"I really like this app, the different tasks and tools in the app really helps me build better habits, manage my moods, and feel healthier."
1,jlem222,"Just another app that lets you set everything up just to get hit with a subscription. People are out here struggling and not everyone has the money for help. I come across an Instagram add for this app stating they have free plans. Correction, it’s a 7day trial. I’m tired of all of the apps that are free to download but you end up needing to pay to actually use it."
5,PurplePalace2012,I’ve been looking for an app like this for quite a while. I love it and wish I would have found it sooner!
5,n 30^7 !,"AYE..If you wanna be Balanced, this is cool an fun an eye catching thing to do when your just sitting on your phone doing, what scrolling; get your life together. With shmoody!"
4,nicknameslays,I can’t sign up because of cookies and I’m 12 so my parents won’t fix it and I tried everything but it hasn't  worked. But thats all.
1,KacieLacy,Please dont have the “upgrade” popup constantly there. it is a stressful color. Let people hide specific topics or hide certain posts on the community tab or honestly let people turn it off completely. This is a doomscroll app pretending to be a “health app”. Let people customize their experience and opt out of things they dont want to participate in.
5,AntigoneRex,"I absolutely love this feature where I can get support from Shmoody Cat. Unlike other wellbeing AI chatbots, I feel incredibly supported by Shmoody Cat. I feel grateful."
3,Mdh0330,"I had the shmoody app and enjoyed it! However when I deleted it and the subscription when I felt as tho I needed to unplug, it still tries to take money from my account."
5,Lena_717,This app is an excellent outlet for my feelings and helps to regulate my mood and behavior. I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling.
5,Pamby456,"Loving how simple the screens are and how the app doesn’t feel overwhelming. I’ve been getting lost in the content, in a good way!"
5,Kitania.xo,This a life changing app. Promotes great self-reflection and improvement. Literally instant therapy and brings you peace of mind. I never knew an app like this could exist.
5,KennaEspo,So far I love this app. The possibility of feeling better doesn’t seem so far. I am so grateful.
5,Lisa B 0721,"I get some good advice when I need it. Also, there are good suggestions for self-care.  Thank you!"
5,_sharaperry_,This is a great place to go when you need headspace or some help. The music tracks are so amazing for studying and the community is very supportive. Thank you!
3,Shortstuff4ever,im not the only one there is an entire thread and no support. I like the app but it wont reset your days or your rountines for certain days show merged with other days that dont have the same schedule
5,The One and Only Rach,And have done a horrible job keeping up with it…   But I do notice a marked difference in the days I do use it.
1,Normanmercury,"I cancelled the subscription, yes even though Mike informed me I must not have. And I was then charged, not the regular charge but the premium year subscription charge. The app still showed as canceled and ended in the apple subscriptions. They are deceptive and then have the nerve to be rude. I would give them 0 stars if I could."
1,crashingspace,"Went to go download this to give it a try, at first everything was looking good but the second it prompted me to know my school information the keyboard popped up and then I couldn’t type anything. I closed and opened the app many times, uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing worked. Kind of bummed."
5,Crochet chick 31,"Schmoody is quite unique and useful! I love the different psycho educational information, breathing and meditation along with built in challenges and behavioral activation. It’s fantastic!"
1,xokiwi_,They let you sign up and say you’ll get notifications for cancellation but you don’t get any then they charge you $40!!!! Such a scam app. Their support team has not contacted me or refunded. They just ignore you. UPDATE  It’s been a week since I emailed the support and I’ve only gotten a response by leaving a review. There’s been zero follow up with this app support.
5,Araeya Stukes,"I actually just started using this app but i like it so far, i love the music in the background"
5,Chris Cactus iykyk,1st day I’m so far so good buuut if I am able to be consistent with the app is another story. I will check back in!
5,Fionna the human,"Really nice calm music, helpful if you wanna try something new but you don’t know the steps so it suggests steps for you and it’s really nice :)"
5,betyui,It’s only been a day and I feel better about the up and coming days
4,Rmnilsen,"This app is a one of a kind that helps you identify struggles, offers tips and tricks for a happy life with better habits! It helps with communication that reduces stressors and anxiety as well!"
5,HaleyShipp,I LOVE schmoody honestly! I’ve been using it pretty consistently to help keep me on track with my mental health journey and it’s been a big help!
1,carol4251954,Shame on this app for the false advertising around being notified you’ll be charged $40 for a self help/mood enhancement app. Absolutely ridiculous. That completely just ruined this app for me. Not coming back.
5,PrincessSkitt,Nice so far just wish everything didn’t have a price tag to help
3,It’s not all fairytales,"I am writing a review because it asked me to, but I have not got enough information or time it to do that correctly. I have just doubled that and I’m looking on my profile."
5,Lynn8190,"Guru cat, the different vibrations for your mood, the little task. I don’t feel overwhelmed and it’s easy to use. Thank you all 🥰"
5,cgalarneau,Literally everything you need for a mood tracker and it has meditation sounds and stuff and thats all free 🙏
1,Lizzie Lou who2,This app is too hard to navigate. There are too many options and the interface is messy. The customer service is abysmal and I’d rather spend my money on a proven program.  there are far better ADHD apps out there - find one that works for you with better customer service!
5,lilly777558,Very customizable and rewarding. Music playing while in app is soothing as well and meditative.
5,Sherosa,I am just trying the app and so far no complaints.
1,TacocatMelz,"The app doesn’t really help, tried to cancel the subscription and it won’t let. It doesn’t appear on my apple subscription, there is no cancel subscription in the app. When I tried chat support it asked me for my email and it wouldn’t let me type, but they sure can bill me $60 for the app."
5,Marshasmello22,"Instead of the doctors being in charge of your mental health, it’s refreshing to KNOW you can HELP YOURSELF as well! I think this is truly a wonderful way to get CONNECTED to yourselves. SOOO HAPPY I FOUND YOU"
2,Nicholee__,"I like the features of the app but it’s so buggy. For someone to pay for the app and half the app doesn’t work kinda bums me out. I hope that in the future the developers are to fix ALL the bugs, until then, I wouldn’t spend any money on it… :("
5,aipv97,This is the best mental health and self care app I have ever used! It is so beautiful and everything is scientifically backed up. I definitely recommend it
5,Tnwalls95,I love this app and everything it has to offer. I just REALLY wish it had a widget option.
1,whyuneedanicknameapple,I downloaded the app to try it out but found out you need a subscription to continue using the app. I read through the entire app description and there is no mention of a subscription or in app purchases. Waste of time.
1,Bavvh,"Before you even bother downloading and trying to use it, know that it won’t let you do anything until you sign up for a subscription.  So, uninstalled, if you won’t let me try your product without agreeing for you to charge me in a week, I’m not interested."
2,Hdrxknifvvjbb,"The app glitches. It deleted my data and made me recreate my plan multiple times. Even when functioning properly, it is basically just a glorified to do list. Buy a white board instead and save yourself the $40."
5,Estefany2081,Mini games Great goals Helps me set reminders Feels like I’m actually being listened to
5,Saif Billah,I love the community on this app. It’s so nice to see what other people are going through and to know that I’m not alone.
1,thewindfarm,"None of the features are usable without a paid subscription, making it completely inaccessible to me and others who might benefit from it. It feels deceptive not to make that clear up front. I wouldn't have wasted my time downloading it."
5,Dmorales9612,Has helped me way more then other motivational apps I’ve used in the past !
4,Fohlys,I really enjoy the app but it seems new. There’s also a lot of bugs and glitches happening.
5,i love puppys and roblox,I love it so much when you get it the first thing you need to try is the guru cat
5,magicalalli,"Pretty cool app, just started using it today so I can’t say to how affective it actually is but I’m pretty excited to find out :)"
5,MommasJelly,It is my first day using this app and I'm ecstatic to see my progression using it! I feel better already 🤭
2,MorgannaWalker,"I’m grateful to the developers for allowing people to have a 7-day free trial so they can see if this app benefits them before parting with money. It was not useful to me, most of the content was tedious and nothing that isn’t available in a zillion other apps. Hard pass."
5,Genya816,"I’ve only just started using it but I like the layout and it seems cozy, so far so good :)"
4,kateadownes,"Love this app, but it’s not working for me. The app won’t open at all. Help! I don’t want to delete and reinstall because I don’t want to lose my data."
5,Lg-05,"This app helps me so much and makes me feel so much better. It motivates me to keep moving, thank you."
5,A̲w̲e̲s̲o̲m̲e̲ a̲p̲p̲,This app is outrageous I feel more confident by the minute I don’t over think as much and you can set a routine   HIGHLY RECOMMEND
2,jrubyb,I was kind of excited about the app.  Downloaded it. Did the initial set up.  Nicely set up at.  It overheated my phone to the point of emergency shutoff.  😐. I have never had an app do that.   I canceled the subscription and deleted the app.
4,Jayfeathervibes,I love that you can set goals and break them down into smaller steps you can check off.
5,ggYNGGRL,Only had it for a couple of days and it’s pretty useful soo far
5,Davyne23,I was experiencing these two at once this apps asks along with the music has helped me
5,RachelBookGirl,The music is really relaxing and so far it is working to help me take care of myself.
5,Kimberly Bratcher,"So far I’ve found it’s helpful. The background music is soothing, and I enjoy guru cat."
1,Odalis Alina,"Made a profile on IG, answered the Qs, but you have to go through them all over again when you download the app, and pay 50 cents, except when you go through it again, the app doesn’t let you continue halfway? Might be a scam"
5,RFK🤗🍳,This app really rocks!!!! I can’t wait for more updates !!!
5,TheNoteDueler,I’m finding that it’s super helpful for getting through my days with adhd :)
1,girlfromthemoon37,"This seems like an amazing app and I was so looking forward to trying it out, but it has had me stuck on the “Shmoody your mental health toolkit 🛞*closest thing I could find to a loading symbol*” for 15 minutes now and I’ve tried reinstalling the app and restarting my phone. Please help! I want to use this app! 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
4,Joey_307,A couple of bugs but a fun way to track how I’m feeling - feels less pretentious than other apps and it’s much more fun to engage with
5,ElliotOsgood,Nothing else like this exists - can’t wait to see the future of Shmoody!
5,Green-flowers,I dont use this every day but some how it picks up my moods and whatnots. Im curious about making it a habit.
5,Bud697,Love it. Really helps with everything the motivations feels like a viedio game with levels and also helps
2,PurplJellyfish,Maybe I’m missing something but after the whole “questions “ segment and doing my daily trying all I get is I have to manually open the app and then choose my own daily goal/task.  How is this different from my literally making a list and then creating tasks in my Google calendar!? The graphics of the cat are cute and all but not worth the money.   This app just sits here in my phone and there’s no structure that I need.   Useless
5,Ckbell1980,This app is like someone crawled inside my brain to try and help me. Thank you 🙏🏻
5,Taylove780,"As both a therapist, mom, as well as a human with ADHD and Anxiety,  I love this app! This app is engaging, simple to use, super aesthetic and effective to recommend to clients and for myself!"
5,Kibasama,Just downloaded the app and am doing the free trial. I’m gonna do my best to keep doing it every day
5,scarfyrre,This is the mental health app I’ve been looking for!  Loving everything about it so far :)
5,Oriiginaldabs,"I actually enjoy this app, it keeps me in a sane space and makes me feel like I’m outside"
5,ChristenaMarie,It lets me write a little entry for each day and log my moods and gives me plans for self-care.
5,aj42894,This app is much more fun and light than other mental health apps. I hated other apps that make it seem like I’m in a mental ward.
5,Beepboopfina,Really great resource for my adhd and helping me remember tasks and keep track of my time and activities!
5,silent libraries,"when i first got the app, the music immediately soothed me; i could feel each part of my body start to relax one by one. the app also allows me to quickly empty the thoughts in my head amidst my busy schedule, helping me track me moods and self-reflect."
5,videoouija10,"Happy to be here, folks"
5,sometown,It’s like a toolkit for when I’m bored. It reminds of all the fun and productive things I can do when I think there’s NOTHING to do.
4,rosemaryet642,It’s a good app first day using it. It could use more ideas and preloaded daily lists etc. it looks good so far
5,kcarb020,Very user-friendly and seems like it’ll fit it’s intended purpose.
4,xRelishLegsx,Currently a new paid subscriber and loving it so far. Can’t wait to see what else this great app has in store.
5,mfriedrichnyc,"Shmoody has a good set of practical ideas and exercises, conveyed in a conversational tone, to help users feel better. Recommend!"
3,Serpentinya,Way too confusing to setup. I couldn’t get it started. Maybe if someone set it up I could go along with it but it didn’t work for me.
5,DirtySwampWitch,I don’t normally leave reviews but I love my Shmoody app. It has helped a lot
5,Shaeluv77,Giving it a chance…We’ll see
5,barbe7667,Highly recommend this app
5,Malkav1981,It’s a great app for keeping an emotional log of your mood. It’s totally worth it if you keep it up
5,My Mental Status,I’m new to the app so I don’t have much input but so far so good
5,SassyGirlFitness,I just got it and I am enjoying setting my goals and getting prompts on positive actions
1,Dyer maker,I did the free trial but it wasn’t for me and I’m trying to cancel my subscription before I get charged the fee but it won’t allow me to cancel on my subscription there is no button for cancel and no where in the app I can cancel either???!
5,Melby1306,"The personality type routine, joy list and joy list calendar is really helpful."
5,yummybytez,"It actually is helping me find myself and improve my mood , i really like it ^_^"
5,AGAINST LAURA,I love the responses for missed texts! I don’t know what to say sometimes and this really helps me
5,Angie⁷,This app helps me track my mood and provides me with tips on how to calm down and relax.
5,lvbzaqwer,I was confused I couldn't do anything and I did a task it suggested and moved forward
5,kaksmdnce,Incredible customer service and great app!
3,nsndjdjddj,It’s good but where are the rest of my mood history notes? I only see it for the month that we are in
5,Stardust moonflower,Makes me feel like I’m doing something good and meaningful for myself.
5,katema0,Useful daily plans. Check ins help with self awareness that you can convert into action. Cute animations :)
5,Bandwife420,Love how this app is so different from others  The music is so calming and it really helps 🫶
5,Brenn456,"As a CBT therapist, I've started using this app myself to test drive it, and I will definitely be recommending it to clients!"
5,crisk1982,I love this app wish I could afford to keep it today is day one of free trial but it’s really helpful
5,Saint Vincent 75,New to this app but so far it’s asking the right questions.
5,@iamchasityg1,I’m catching myself telling all my friends! It’s really LIT! Just be patient with yourself. It’s all in the mindset.
5,Toni-paleo 2013,Helps you stay on track
5,Talishaw75,I rate it 5 stars because I like the design and the whole concept❣︎❣︎❣︎
3,Juuli0725,I really loved this app until they started making you pay for the text helper feature.
4,nintendo freak9011,We’ll see the long term benefits but it seems like it could be good for me
4,Pinkdaddy101,It prompts you to fill things out which makes it easier than journaling.
5,Liv⚜️,I downloaded this app and it feels like i have a community of support and I’m clearly not alone
5,paramorewx,"Helps a lot so far, you can tell they really care."
2,NibbNitts,"So, the sound in the background, even when muted, still plays when I close the app. A waste of battery power."
5,Emmb13,"Just started this app. So so much to explore, all so easy to read with calmness and no pressure."
5,Curiosity Lynn,"Love this app!  Helps me everyday , find that positive attitude that I forget that I have sometimes!"
3,𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐚,I enjoy this app. I just want to be easier for people who are really struggling.
4,GoldDust17,Similar to another app I have called finch. Interesting with the different modes though
1,muthaofdragunz,"It works fine, but you only have access to one challenge that is free. If you’re looking for real help, this app will not help you unless you pay for it. Not everyone has extra money to just spend. It seems very predatory to me."
5,Mondragon444,im enjoying it as much as i can before my trial runs out bc ik i can’t afford it lol
5,RaRa3:16,It’s interesting and fun also surprising as u make a profile. I like this app so far.
1,JV123!!,I canceled my subscription during the free trial period and deleted the app because I just wasn’t in love with the app itself. I woke up this morning to a subscription charge on my account. Thankfully my bank declined it! Nice scam you’re running here.
5,Henry Hays,You can tell that the app is made by cool people who care
3,mimi24/7,I don’t really know enough about it yet. We’re still working on it. It’s just my first 30 minutes on it.
5,Nickilipstick,Im surprised. Its day one and I have a little bit more pep. Im working my way out of deep depression mode.
4,Emily’s had it,Only used it for 1 day so need more time to figure out how it works
1,bipolarred,Seems like a great concept except the world gets rich off of people with mental health issues. So it’s free to download but before you even see the app you have to pay!!! Worst ever.  If I could give low life people like this a zero I would. Quit getting rich off of what people need to survive.
1,mynamewastakenbythefae,I wish I could find an app that was helpful but not an amount I can’t afford. It’s either too expensive or a depressing amount of ads. Absolutely demoralizing. ☹️  Sure they give you a free week but then what?   I Can’t afford help.
5,LouDevito030,"I like how it’s not pushy, and it’s organized so it’s not so in your face and overwhelming"
5,Rebecca90,This is such a great app! It has everything I need to manage my day and my mental health.
5,Sodndhdhdodixbskao,With one conversation and my mental health has improved so much.
1,AMK1480,Accidentally purchased without realizing.  Company does not respond to messages and will not issue a refund.  Reaching out to credit card company now to refund the charge.
5,NicStock,"I just downloaded the app and I already love it! Thanks so much for the advice with the Schmoody chat cat, love!!"
5,Sunset Sparkler,I’m just now trying this out.
5,iCarly83,I would recommend highly. So much to do
1,rachelann802,"Downloaded after seeing an ad on Instagram and really needed something. The app never loaded, just sat on the initial loading screen. Restarted phone, reinstalled the app, was very patient, no luck. As far as I’m aware, this app is not functional."
4,Kronosthefallentitan,Just started hoping this can help with my problems

5,1FreeApp,Fun for entire family!
1,Lisa Eads,I tried the trial version and it wasn’t for me. So I canceled my subscription and I was still charged almost $40 with no customer service to reach out to for resolution.

4,CUdelpuf,With what I've had the chance of using is great!
5,ABGD,Simple yet effective tool to help you get out of that funk!
1,RenaMarieeeeee,This app shows that it’s free but there are literally zero features you can use without making a payment or signing up for a free trial. Not sure why apple lets these apps advertise themselves as feee.
1,finnzz,"This app kept deleting my account details and action plans. Also, you can’t put many goals on the action plans. Another terrible to do list app"
5,SamGAdams,I’ve been app hunting for a good one for my depression and ADHD and so far Shmoody is the ticket!
1,$ÜS,lol! Makes you go through all these steps to tell you you have to buy a membership after a month😂. Why are you benefiting of people's depression? Sounds like a plot twist to me
1,ninernikki,"I hate to leave bad reviews, especially for apps with good causes, but I was charged for this app with no way for me to cancel this subscription through Apple. It feels very scammy."
5,Ky bear hi,Love this app! Helps me in all sorts of different ways
5,Ashmarieeeeee13,Dude this app is awesome! Its easy to navigate and keeps my attention! Love it!
3,wheatfarmer5,Writing this review after using the app for ten minutes… so… jury is out.

2,FroggyDoggyDoo🐸🐶💩,"could be a good app, but i got extremely frustrated when i realized i couldn’t use most features without paying money. i couldn’t even add in my own routine without having to do so. finch is a better app, as there’s much less hidden behind a paywall, and id recommend people try that out."
1,SkaterBarbie87,"Was charged twice for this service? $80 all together. Shmoody wouldn’t help so I had to go through my bank, ended up canceling entirely because I do not like that shady kind of stuff."
5,shmoodmood,So far I like the framework
4,Haleysmom11,"I have ADHD and I saw an ad for this app so I figured I’d give it a try. I was not a fan of going in thinking it was free for at least a basic version but then after doing the initial customization questions finding out it’s a free trial period. I was then further disappointed upon seeing the payment is annually instead of one-time. I am a VERY frugal person so I wasn’t going to pay for an app continuously now matter how well it worked for me. BUT then after closing that screen an offer for a ONE-TIME PAYMENT for the app showed up and I was more than happy to do that seeing as how it was close to the annual price. So far I haven’t used the app much because I keep forgetting I have it (the literal reason I have the app lol) but here’s what I think about what I have used. I love the initial customization process that lets you tailor the app format according to what you want to use the app for (ADHD, mood improvement/tracking, etc.). I was excited that the ADHD option made the layout simple and task-oriented because I get overwhelmed with crowded apps with too much stuff everywhere. The community section is well-executed, you can chose a category your post falls under so people can easily find posts they want to interact with. The list of things you love/enjoy is a brilliant idea, and there’s a calendar specifically to put these activities on so you make time for things you enjoy. Home Screen (for the ADHD task-oriented layout) has “today’s plan” at the top (basically to-do list). If you’re wondering whether or not to get this app I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, only for the one-time purchase though, I personally don’t think it’s worth a continuous payment but I’m super frugal. !MY ONE SUGGESTION! The only thing that would make this app 5-star AMAZING is adding a widget for the “today’s plan” so people can have their list on their Home Screen. Because of my ADHD I forget I have the app so I forget to look at this list, having that widget would make things SO much easier."
2,Marionette Henuber,"I’m a broke college student. When I found this app, I thought that I had finally found a mental health app that has a good free version/is free.  I just wish that the app was more upfront with you about the fact that there is a subscription.  But the app features seem really cool (reason for the 2 stars vs 1)"
5,ashleymariemartin,i just downloaded the app and it’s so easy to use! makes me happy already and i’m excited to get things done!!
5,DisneyMom0816,"I get served a lot of these but this one is good, trust"

5,softato,Super cute and easy to navigate
5,Queen smoke 98,"App works good, has lots of things to do"
5,RuRuStar,for this mood tracker to really work you have to put in the effort! this app makes it really easy to do that though 💓
4,A girl💦,I’m enjoying this positive app. I need this encouragement.
1,NJB63077,Was told I would receive a reminder email notifying me before a charge was made after trial period and I did not receive an email.
2,Rogue_Ghostie,You have to pay for every feature
5,SamWise2212,Very fun and relaxing way to learn.
5,Married092615*,Helping feel accomplished!!!!!! Plus the fun sounds of accomplishments!
1,Wahine78,I literally wanted to try the app and for some odd reason I canceled it and you guys still charged me so I would like my money back. You are so wrong.
3,Maya Porten,"this was the feature i was most excited for, but now it doesn’t show up for me. my friend verified that it’s working for her so i’m not sure why it’s just me. i would really love this app if it weren’t for this bug ):"
5,hailey.bugg,"i’m quite satisfied with this app and very grateful for it, especially because it’s hard for me to have time for therapy or even afford it"
5,JlynnP78,This app is great all the way around.
1,Frustrated with ya,"I would love to rate this app thoroughly but it won’t even load when I open it, nothing but a purple screen. I deleted it and redownloaded. So much for the trial…"
5,thimu,"Very helpful for monitoring moods, and teaching skills to help with mental health."
5,happymealbabe,Smoosh has helped me identify and regulate my emotions! I recommend it!!!

4,GabsFlabs,its a lovely app i wish it wasn't so expensive to have the full experience… but still an amazing concept and very well designed
2,thisgameloopsglitch,"I feel like this app would help me so much, but a subscription is not something i can afford :("
1,lilmissmelodym,Seems it could be a helpful app but not when i literally can’t do anything but talk in the AI chat… cancelled my sub and deleting
1,Mhdhdue,"This app is completely useless and it only costs $70! Wow, what a steal! Because it literally IS!!!! Do not waste your time or money."
1,JjRreed,Never got past Choose your Theme color with mediocre 90s mediation music playing in the background
1,Razzy5000,The opening sequence of this app alone had me crawling out of my skin. No way I’m going to pay someone to make my anxiety and depression worse. This is predatory junk.
1,Marrie222,. Very disappointing. I don’t enjoy being tricked into downloading apps only to find out you have to pay
1,lucky1367,I didn’t want this app and after trying their trial there is no were you can go to cancel
3,Phantist,"Disclaimer: I’m currently trying to improve my relationship with the cat because I like the text helper, wish me luck  The cat gave me about eight unskippable side quests that I had to complete before I could unlock the app and now I hate him. Our enemies arc really took off when he tried to make me listen to a self-help podcast (luckily I outwitted him by skipping to the end of the track, but not before I rage quit the app, wasted the rest of my free trial days, and accidentally became a paying subscriber because I forgot to cancel it and then I forgot to ask for a refund and then I just sort of accepted it lol). The self-help thing wasn’t even the end of it though; after that, he time-locked me out of getting his unskippable tasks over with in one sitting, only increasing my rage. I finally managed to complete all the tasks, but now, after all that, he has the audacity to keep popping up in the corner to ask how I’m feeling as if he did nothing wrong!! He’s probably besties with the Duolingo owl (it would explain a lot).   All jokes aside, this app seems like it could be pretty good; I decided to leave a review because I think that it would be improved significantly if it gave the user an option to skip the tutorial, especially if it’s being marketed towards people with ADHD. The cat brought the whole ‘problems with authority’ side of the disorder out of me pretty badly during the tutorial, and now my negative feelings about anything he tells me to do are interfering pretty severely with my ability to engage with the app’s features in a positive way (although I do like many of them, especially the mood tracker and the text helper). Maybe this is a common experience, or maybe it’s not, idk."
5,Airyonhonda,Automatically puts me in a good mood :)
1,eggsald,great app but i had to delete it because it was being slow. when i tried to redownload it it stayed on the loading screen. i’ve downloaded and deleted it about 5 times to get it off this loading screen but it has not budged .
3,DeniseX8826,"I’m evaluating this app at the $40/year price point because that’s probably the subscription most people will opt for. Unfortunately, there seems to be a growing trend of bait-and-switch type of apps, where they say “In app purchases,” but what they really mean is “Pay for our app in our app instead of paying the App Store.” They do give you a 7-day free trial, but (a) that always makes me skeptical because it’s essentially a game of how many people will forget to cancel their subscription before they’re charged again and (b) coincidentally, the mood prediction analysis happens to take 6 days.   Why do I say you could do it yourself? Well, from what I can tell, the meat of this app is in its “action plans,” which I think are supplemented with suggestions made by their mood prediction analysis. These plans are essentially a list of short and simple tasks, such as: meditate for two minutes, do simple stretches, have a snack, make a cup of tea, etc. Essentially, all you would have to do to DIY is go on Pinterest or Google and look up self-care or productivity ideas or whatever you are after and choose 3-5 to make a routine.   Those caveats aside, this is why I still gave it 3 stars: (1) it is well-made and looks nice (2) it would likely work well for people who are very short on time and need a quick way to practice self-care or other good habits (3) there’s nothing really wrong with the app, per se. I don’t like the way this advertised and priced. However, the reality is there are many convenience apps that help you save time by doing things for you that you could do yourself."
1,BrightBrandon,"Lots of login bugs, etc. Makes it annoying to use."
1,Mkim12345,I paid 50cents to try the app and can’t even get past the themes page.
5,coolcaya,It is helping me with my routines
4,Tattooedsinner,"So far, this app is pretty fun to use and super easy."
1,JNL7177,Any app that doesn’t streamline cancelling and charges regardless does not deserve a star at all. Please fix this situation.
5,LoveCatahoulas,Love this app. Keeps me self aware and it’s fun
5,13ber,Good app to motivate n track mood n routine
5,hey i am a gurlll,so far i like the vibes of the app. i’m unsure how many free functions there actually are but i’m enjoying it
1,Lamuzik123,Like no
5,tiffppww33,It’s great helps me remember and stay on task
3,megan.eg.11,sometimes i check off a habit and i exit the app and the habit is not checked off. i can't check any off at this point.
5,thenotoriouskiaaa,the app has a lot of benefits that can help with day to day motivation and organization.
5,Jillybean315!,Very relaxing
5,tash.6GOD,This makes me happier
4,Uhwhsudirj,Cute and functional and decently affordable.
5,SimiCap,This app helps a lot!
1,Elamennelp,I cancelled the app before the free trial ended but the app is still charging my account - even AFTER reporting it to the App Store for a refund.
5,Bluefinder26,"So fun, so cute, very helpful!!!!"
2,AppleUserID18,"Update: I added a star because the developers are very responsive. They responded to help tickets, letting me bypass their pacing. However, I ended up deleting the app and getting a refund. The last straw for me was when the app wanted access to my calendar to create routines. I don’t want routines on my calendar. Other apps I’ve tried just let you create routines in the app. This app isn’t for me, but if you’re a teen or a young adult, maybe it’ll be right for you. ——— The most frustrating thing about this app is that when you buy it, you still don’t have access to all of the features for an unknown period of time because the developers have decided to pace your usage of the app rather than letting you do it yourself. I’m motivated and know myself and what I need. I paid for a lifetime of use of the app, yet they keep restraining me from all of the features until I jump through the hoops and time period they think I should have to rather than letting me have 100% usage of the app I now have. I get that they may be concerned you’ll go all in and then fall off the wagon or something, but really, that’s MY realm to manage, not theirs. I bought the app because I need help now, not at some future unknown date that is controlled by someone who thinks they know my psychology better than I do. I’ll update this app in the future if I find it helpful enough, but I think I’ll always be deducting stars based on this awful initial experience. Furthermore, the community feature in which you can post to others and receive feedback is full of very young people with teen-level emotions, maturity, and problems. But hey, I can’t respond to help or even post my own original posts because the developers aren’t letting me yet. 🙄 At this point, I’m regretting my purchase and looking at their competitors for the help this app should be giving me now."
5,✨bug bug✨,I love this app no one was there for me and Shmoody understood me.
1,waka waka this time for Africa,I don’t use gmail or apple mail.  So I couldn’t sign-up
5,CDaughn,Best app I’ve used yet!!!
5,Knightinwhitexx,"I don’t review apps often, but this one deserves a review so that it can hopefully reach more people who need help with mental health and getting out of bed.  I downloaded this app and was reluctant to pay for the subscription because like most people, we want to try it out before we have to pay. But one day I decided to finally just try it and I paid for it.   I started using this app during one of the hardest times of my life, and it has helped me substantially. Setting little goals for myself, creating a simple to do list, and using the AI chat features has helped me through my anxiety and depression. The AI chat feature actually feels like you’re getting advice from a therapist. (Not that it should replace a professional) but for moments in between therapy sessions, it is super helpful when you need a different perspective, or actionable steps during issues that come up in life.  If I’m having anxiety, I write out my feelings to the chat, and it gives me ideas to help me out of spiraling into deeper anxiety or depressive episodes. As well as also being non-judgemental. (Obv cuz it’s an AI lol.)   My only suggestions to better the app would be to make at least one of the chat AI’s a bit more conversational, like for example, being able to vent to the AI and have those feelings validated in a conversational way, rather than just offering a solution right away. And my other suggestion would be to make it easier to create new plans and organize them a bit better. There should be a “create a new plan” option so that I can start a fresh plan each day without having to manually delete each task.   More meditations, music and soundscapes would be nice too.   Otherwise, this app is super helpful and I really enjoy it."

5,Ballzguzzler,I am having fun with Garren My Solgaleo!!
1,crissyampersand,This app is not helpful. It just exhausts dopamine/seratonin and keeps you prone to your already bad habits. Gamifying things perpetuates problems and causes depression.
2,Jiggly joggles,"haven't been able to use the app at all, all i get is a loading screen but nothing actually happens :("

5,MomWifeHealthylife,This app is amazing I love it
4,Anti-Dieting2020,"Overall, I love the aesthetic of the app. The cuteness of it really motivates me and makes me excited to open the app every day. I also love how the widget spotlights things scheduled from your “joy list”. It makes me look forward to starting the day instead of dreading the tasks I feel like I have to do. For me the cute/chibi aesthetic is much more appealing than the sleek aesthetic of many similar apps.  Some feedback/notes:   I think the pricing is a bit bizarre and predatory. There is a seven day free trial but only if you sign up for the yearly subscription, for ~$35. I think this price is fair but the monthly prices is ~$15 dollars a year which makes no sense. They’re basically only offering one reasonable option which is to sign up for the full year before you get to really sample the app.   There are also A LOT of bugs. I think some of these could be due to user error (😅) but there’s no way to troubleshoot or report issues and get help! They really need to create an FAQ or some sort of help request feature so users can get assistance with issues. Even if not same day, it would be helpful!  1) the “Mood Analysis” doesn’t seem to work at all. The feature is supposed offer you insightful mood predictions and suggestions after about a week of logging your mood and activities. I’ve logged my mood and used the app almost daily for a few weeks and the app still says “we’ll have your first analysis ready in 3 days” 2) the daily plan doesn’t refresh every day or on any regular intervals. For example, let’s say my daily plan suggests “take medication” and I mark that complete on Monday. On Tuesday, when I open the app, “take medication” is still marked complete.  3) I had a bunch of fun populating my “joy list” so I could get routine suggestions. A few days later, the entire list was gone and the app just says “Empty Space: add your first item” and there seems to be no way to fix this other than starting completely over (I have adhd and will obviously not do that unless I’m really procrastinating something else, which is exactly the sort of thing the app is supposed to help me avoid)"
4,Roses$ForDays,"The pros are mainly,that I love how I started going into the app,getting it catered to me,as how I see it,and the plans I could make with actions (I haven’t tried the routine actions,yet,but I can’t,I will say why down in the cons section.),I love how for some actions I saw,”Write down all your frustrations”,because I never hear of that often or at all,I usually hear,”Write in your journal”,so much to use the journals for,& it’s not an easy task so far to find what you want your journal to be like,or for me anyways so far,because hearing this action to add into my plans on the app made me feel even more better though,I still have trouble finding the words to really get to the nitty gritty of my frustrations,I didn’t stress to much on this when,I wanted to try it out :).  Another action called,”Draw,even if you don’t draw”,was also a good action to my plan list,because I do indeed draw,but this could helped me take a time of my day to draw,as I get bored easily,stressed easily,thinking I cannot draw this,thinking that it isn’t good enough.  All because I had focused on too much negativity that was being shown to me because I didn’t do xyz,& didn’t do enough xyz for someone.  No ads,which is so good! :)   The music so far is very calming and relaxing compared to other music,I hear to calm & relax people,& so far plenty of options? (then again,I didn’t explore the app too much,so hence the question mark on,”so far plenty of options?”,😌🥹  The cons are: I want to say I would like a few more action plans that are pre-made in this app,to be free,but that’s only my opinion,because so far you gave out three pre-made plans,& a lot of actions I can make of the same pre-made plan,that I just didn’t think/noticed yet if that is true.  2.I don’t enjoy the pop ups when I first got into this app,it was like I saw about 4 of them,maybe the same of each,one was possibly the one limited time offer? I didn’t really pay much attention to.  3.I understand this could still be my issue but at the same time,iPhones are known to fill up fast or tell you that no matter how you might have more storage space,though I also don’t like how this litterly makes my storage space kind of full,but full according to it,and I understand that the app needs a lot of storage for it because it’s actually awesome! So please don’t take this to heart,it’s a con for me,& I would love to enjoy the app one day to many more days.  If this is on,Android I may install this there,I’m sure it is on,Android,if you possibly see me reviewing this through,Google Play,I still might say it is mainly my problem with how my phones work,especially my android/android’s.But I indeed hope,to enjoy more experiences this app has to offer! 😄"

1,👑👿🔥,The app won’t even load for me
5,lil tortelli,it really motivates me and helps hold me accountable to my goals !
3,Wattergirl87,"…and I really like it, but I can’t love it because of some fundamental pieces that seem to be missing. I used this app for a solid two weeks and accomplished a lot in that time. There were some tiny bugs peppered throughout, but nothing major. I was really enjoying it as it’s definitely unique to lots of other mental health apps I’ve tried.   A few days ago, I replaced my phone, loaded Shmoody on my new phone and expected to login to my existing account. However, there was so option to do that. When you open the app for the first time, there is no option to sign in. It takes you through the steps as if you’re brand new. I did the steps, thinking that the app would recognize my email as already in use, but no dice. I also found out the hard way when I logged out of the app on my old phone that there is no way to get back to your original profile. I went back to the new phone, set up a new profile, then after searching was able to find my original profile and make a friend request.   This is a major problem! I lost ALL my data! My mood history, direction messages, posts, replies, etc. seeing as the app is over a year old, I’m astonished that a feature as fundamental as a sign in link is missing! I emailed support three days ago, so hopefully I’ll hear back soon and they can recover my data.  On a more minor note, there were lots of functionality issues that could be improved. For example, when I would make a post, it would give me a success message but it wouldn’t show up on top of the thread. However, if I scrolled down, sometimes I would find it way down in the middle of all the older comments. Or comment and like counters wouldn’t load on random posts/comments. Or some checklist items would reset and not stay “checked off.” Those were tolerable with the hope that a future update would soon clear them up. But no sign in option to get back to your existing account? I don’t understand and I really hope my data can be recovered! 😭"
1,saradoster,THIS APP HAS CHARGED ME 4 SEPARATE TIMES SINCE CANCELLING MY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION!!!! They are scammers and i have had to file 4 claims with my credit card and change my card number!!
1,BEE-4231,It’s a Lie. It barely has any animals and I was expecting it to have little mini pets in it. 🥺

1,Gekxoogkfbscgaic,"I tried their 7 day free trial, found out shortly after I didn’t like the app that much so I tried to delete it from my subscriptions but of course it was nowhere to be found. So I deleted the app thinking it would be alright, a week later they charge me $60 even though they were nowhere to be found in my subscriptions list!! I have been trying everything I can to get a refund for this but I’m not having much luck with the support they provide through this app. So now I’m literally going to the bank to see what they can do to help me because this is just ridiculous. I am extremely frustrated and do not recommend anyone to spend money on this app, they don’t offer a way to get out of any sort of subscriptions or deals and they will steal your money. I want my money back this is unbelievable. Update I finally found a way to delete my subscription, it’s so convenient for them that they show up nowhere in your Apple subscriptions, you have to go through the settings ON THE APP to manage your subscription. Absolutely ridiculous. If I’m being charged for anything I want it showing up in my Apple subscriptions JUST LIKE THE REST OF EVERYTHING THAT IM CHARGED FOR. But no, not this app. Out of every other subscription I’ve had through my APPLE ACCOUNT, this is the only subscription that DOES NOT SHOW UP, so convenient for them. I don’t have money for this stupid app. I WANT A REFUND NOW!!!! If I don’t get a refund I’m literally going as far as reporting this to my bank and getting everyone I know to give a terrible review on this app. Give me my money back. Your “help” for receiving a refund is useless. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK I WORK HARD FOR IT AND ID RATHER SPEND IT ON ANYTHING ELSE THAN THIS STUPID SCAM OF AN APP."
5,Leslie Kaylee,I love love this   app!
5,Ampur12,cool & helpful.
1,mahdisnejwiwsu,"Way to expensive, very overwhelming, not good"
5,Halley0513,Schmoody is delightful!!!
1,lil_lori_anne,this app said they were giving me a free trial of their app - and then charged me for a year membership! i’m not interested and want my money back.
2,Becky Love 224,"I have requested a refund because of two reasons:  1 . As a neurodivergent person I feel very distrustful of a developer who promises to remind me when my trial period is almost over, then does not follow through. It negates anything positive that their product could have done for my well-being.   2. As a sight challenged person with small hands and therefore a small phone screen, I could not easily use the daily mood check in because all of the icons did not fit to screen with the phone settings I’ve chosen to best read text. The bottom row was cut off. I had to change my phone settings to do the check in, then change then back to use my phone as normal. This process made what could have been a simple and quick check in a painstaking and lengthy process.   For me, the amount of time that this setting issue took up was the amount of time I could have been exploring all that the app had to offer. I may have wanted to purchase the annual subscription.   However, without the *promised* reminder that my free trial period was almost over, I lost trust in the developer and would not want to engage in business with anyone who doesn’t follow through on a promise. Why add in to your spiel that is target marketed to ADHD individuals that you’ll remind us, and then not follow through?   I hope my experience and review will inspire the developer to do better by their future users. It seems like they wish to help us with a solid product, and for that I am grateful. This is why I give two stars and not just one for poor business practice."

3,Lambie68,"I downloaded the app on the free trial.  The free trial really isn’t free.  I was charged $4.99 right after downloading it.   I have looked all over the app and website and cannot find a cancel button anywhere.  They keep trying to charge me $59.99/month.  Luckily my card has declined it.  How do I cancel and stop these charges?? I like the app, but cannot afford $60/month."
1,SC1984!,Be cautious! I agreed to a one day trial and was charged that PLUS a $59.99 subscription fee that I did NOT agree to!
2,Rhinotink,Their app states that they will send a reminder email 3 days before the trial ends. My medical conditions result in memory loss and normally I create an alarm when I’m trying out trial offers to remind myself to cancel if needed. However when signing up for the free trial they stated “Day 4 you’ll receive a reminder email that your trial is ending “. Then I received a receipt on day 7 for the $39.99. I searched my emails and there wasn’t a reminder email. I’m very frustrated that I didn’t follow my normal routine of setting a reminder alarm. You would think an app that supports mental health would follow their own guidelines as not to increase stress on their customer.   There are some cool features on the app but nothing I can’t find for free on YouTube.
1,madmumbler,I cancelled this a couple of days ago while in the free trial (which I actually paid for) and was just charged $39.99 even though I cancelled plenty early enough. WTH??? Now I have to fight to get the charge reversed.
2,nervouscoyote,"This app looks beautiful and possibly helpful, but I didn’t get past the initial introduction because they already insist on signing up for a subscription. There is a free trial but no free basic version, which at $14.99 a month for the full version is ridiculous. I won’t even begin the free trial only to be disappointed in not being able to afford the monthly subscription. There are still too many people mentioning the bugs in the app to risk it anyway."
1,meegin1989,"I downloaded this app for a free trial, was unable to get into app because it needs a confirmation code that disappeared before I could enter it. Even though I can’t get into the app they have charged me $40 and I can’t even get in to cancel it."
1,americanmualim,***removed a star & Edited bc of developer response trying to gaslight me!!  I have documentation proving I canceled the trial THE DAY I SIGNED UP and that A WEEK LATER THEY STILL TRIED TO CHARGE ME! Yall probably pay people for their fake positive reviews! ***      I canceled my trial the same day that I signed up for it. But a week later at the end of the trial they still tried to collect their $39.99. Good thing I used a card for an account I don’t keep $$ in for this exact reason. Shady companies. I gave 2 stars only because when I reached out on the website via their chat option the agent said they saw the charge failed and that they canceled it for sure so no other charges. We will see.
2,Air In H.,"I guess I expected more when I bought an entire year of this app.  Can’t schedule any repeat anything’s cause I I won’t give the app full access to everything in my calendar.  As such… Creating an action plan every single day is annoying and has made it so I I rarely use the app.  I try to use the music section but all of them seem to clitch after one rotation, regardless of the repeat feature.   Shmoody isn’t for me and I wasted a year’s worth of app fees to learn that in two weeks."
1,Mommichula,I can’t tell you if this app is beneficial or not because I couldn’t use it because you have to pay to use this app and it isn’t cheap. Some of us can’t afford $14.99 a month or $39.99 a year or $119.99 for a lifetime. Some of us are on fixed limited income and could benefit from this app but can’t afford the payments.
1,KLKF78,"I downloaded this app with the offer of a 7-day free trial before being billed. They billed me immediately- the full $39.99. When I reported the problem to Apple, the company refused to refund my money."
1,Sadie Neu,I started with free trial was not given any notice about a renewal - took away my very limited food budget for -charged 43.44 and apple denied my refund. Im devastated to be taken advantage like this. It feels predatory towards ppl who are looking for hope and assistance using their limited capacity in daily life.
3,mmisssmol,"I just started my free trial and thinking I might keep it but there’s one dealbreaker (for me)- when you check things off the list, your background Spotify or whatever background music stops. Ugh drives me crazy when apps do this - possible to change this?"
1,Hannalizzy,"I found this app because I’m in a low place, mentally, physically, and financially. I felt a glimmer of hope, seeing the app was free and sounded like exactly what I needed to help get me to a better place. The intro was beautiful and relaxing, and I felt so seen and heard, and then once I put in my profile information…. they want to charge me 14.99 a month or 40$ a year. I can’t afford to get better, I guess. 42% of gen z (like me) have diagnosed mental health issues. 42%! and gen z is also facing a financial crisis with higher rates of credit card debt than ever before, a minimum wage that can absolutely not support a home or family in this economy, all while inflation keeps increasing. We have so many things we need to pay for these days, and a lot of the people who need this app are the ones who are struggling financially as well as mentally because of that. I’d rather pay 10$ one time to get better than 80$ over time (since this app is supposed to support and encourage short term AND long term goals meaning you would need to use it for a long time for the app to really help you) to do something that I’m already struggling to do: manage my life with crippling anxiety and depression. I wish that wasn’t a privilege these days.   They say most of the app is free to use without the payments and that is just not true, plus it’s glitchy. I don’t just want the developers to offer me an extended free trial from this review, I want to get better LONG term. I get that the developers need to be paid as well, but there should be a monthly option that is 5$ or less rather than a yearly plan if they really want this app to be used by its target demographic and to benefit the people who need it most. If you truly want to help people and not just exploit their mental illness for monetary gain, make it cheaper. End of story. Cut down your team if you have to. Do a kickstarter, I don’t care. Make it cheaper."
2,Tventimig,When I signed up and decided to try the free trial they went ahead and charged my card $39.99 that’s just sketchy to me. I ended up just choosing the monthly and it doesn’t seem all that special in fact I’m very likely going to cancel.
1,Nnycurl,"I was unable to get the app setup and working, now I’m stuck with it for a year for $43.19. Save your time, money and the hassle. Thanks for the added stress and anxiety."
