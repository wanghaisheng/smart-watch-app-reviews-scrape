4,AceVariable4017/Variouspoisons,"Normal progression is incredibly slow, AI has just about every possible upper hand for the majority of the time you play thru it, being able to spawn 20+ troops at once whereas you would literally have to wait the entirety of the level and then some in order to accumulate that much, cards are far and few between with what seems like very little impact, and ads drive 90% of the progression. Watch an ad for resources, watch an ad for game speed, watch an ad for a card (2x per day), watch an ad to double what meaningless currency you get, spend 10k coins on a .02 upgrade that makes literally no difference and in order for it to you have to spend upward of 50k coins on average. Very grindy game with very little actual reward of any kind, more just to waste your time mostly.  Update: I got to a point when my damage for archers later on one tap their archers, and survive one arrow. Had 3 out against 2 and one of the two never got hit, all three shot and one got hit by two, the third somhow wizzed between. How does it miss????"
3,tombutterman,"This game is exactly what it set out today. Not the most advanced or well-done game but an enjoyable way to spend a portion of your time. The mechanics are a copy of another game but that’s all right. that doesn’t really take away from the experience.  I only have one complaint. when I played the game, I wanted to see if I could beat it on Stone Age so I spent hours upgrading the speed at which units can be built so that I could Zerg swarm my enemies. eventually, I got to a point where the gains were not fast enough to be enjoyable and I would most likely have to spend twice the amount of hours to beat the next level. at that point, I decided to go ahead and upgrade to the next page. When I did all of the upgrades I made to my units disappeared, and I was actually weaker.  I know that I was not playing the game the way it was meant to be played, but I also spent about as much time on the Stone Age as it would normally take people to beat the whole game. I would’ve been all right to not be rewarded for the time I spent, but it felt pretty bad to be punished for it. I don’t think the developer thought that people would spend so much time in the Stone Age that they could knock out a soldier every 3/4 of a second. it just would have been so much more enjoyable an experience if the time I spent was rewarded. I clicked on the optional get extra money for watching an advertisement after every run."
2,Diggygibson,"This game is so disappointing! It’s the only game I’ve played that punishes you for purchasing things with your actual real money. The moment I purchased items is the exact moment the level became impossible to beat. Before purchasing the items, game progression was slow and incremental but possible. But now, after buying the $22 and two $7 items I conclude each battle with the same monetary reward, regardless of the many upgrades I applied after the purchases. It appears that purchasing the items made the game too difficult the play. Now I feel like I just wasted $36 plus tax. I want to give this game one star but I have to give it two stars because it was fun enough to make three purchases. Yes, I purchased all three items on the same day. My advise to others is to proceed with caution. If you can avoid it, don’t watch ads and definitely don’t purchase anything unless you don’t mind feeling ripped-off. Be aware, the moment you purchase and/or watch ads is the exact moment the game stop functioning the same. Also, another annoying thing is that some ads didn’t allow me to continue playing. After I finish watching the ad the “x” does not function causing me to have to close out the game and reopen it. You just simply lose your reward: just another reason why I feel ripped off."
5,CarebearAK,"The game doesn’t force any adds on you! You can choose to watch adds to get more rewards, but the game is still totally beatable without watching the adds. This game is definitely a bit of a grind but it can be really fun. It also requires a fair bit of strategy to beat. I really like that because in most games you just spam click soldiers, however in this game you have to really think about when to send them out and which troops are best. I do think it can start out slow, you kind of have to be willing to play for a bit to get in the swing of things. The first few levels are SUPER tuff, but if you play past them the cards help and the game gets WAY more fun. Lots of strategy is required when choosing what upgrades to get as well. My only complaint is that you do have to work REALLY hard to progress and it can get repetitive when you have to play the same level for the 10th time. Yet somehow that just adds charm to the game making it hard to progress without being impossible. Overall it’s a really good strategy game! I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Finchjr,Game that lets you battle ever harder opponents and events that occur intermittently during which you can earn bonuses. The game unfairly favors its characters regardless of stats earned. During one of these events that became apparent to me. When the opponents characters leave their base they are set up in an optimal pattern which is never something you’re able to set up. Your characters come out in a single file line and March towards the opponent’s without lining up side by side like the opponents characters. In addition your shooting characters will often all aim at the same opponent causing them to miss any shots made at the same time whereas the opponents shots even when at the same time will target different targets.   The unfair AI mechanics to your characters ensure it takes overwhelming numbers advantage to overcome. If you want to get to that overwhelming advantage it’s going to take you hours of boring repetitive play or ridiculous sums of money.   Overall poor game mechanics and construction despite stupidly simple graphics and simple problems to fix would be most simply explained by the game designers desiring unfair game mechanics. I’m all for supporting game creators but the ads in games should be enough. Don’t make a game unwinable just to force people to buy your in game content. Hope the stolen money gives you an ulcer you high mileage street walkers.
2,Reedear,"The game concept is actually interesting. However, the progression is super SLOW. I’ve been playing for about a little over a week and am only on the start of timeline 3. And that’s with watching some of the reward ads that come up after every round. I also watch the measly two ads you get to get “upgrade” cards to upgrade your units once a day. I’ve got a decent amount of these cards, a few upgraded to level 2 or 3, but, somehow, my units are always quite weak against the computer. It’s like the cards don’t really make much difference. I, sometimes, watch the ads to get instant meat for your fighters, so you can spawn more at once, but you only seem to get this ad chance twice a day… and often it’s STILL not enough to win a level because the computer will spawn 2-8 units at a time, when you can only spawn like 2-3, even with the extra meat. You may have to play a level 10+ times to get anywhere. The meat spawning rate is super low. For example, only upgrading like 0.2/second for, like 20k gold, which can take you 4+ rounds to get, depending on if you watch ads.  It’s just sad how much it relies on ads and there’s no way to buy an ad free option. Doubt I’ll play for much longer because it’s so much of a grind."
1,Hshahfjwjjwjwiwhs,"Newest update got rid of the ability to buy skill potions and keys for bosses and I think it was a poor decision. To buy a new hero it costs 300 skill potions but you only earn like 9 per age so you need to go through like 6+ timelines just to save up for that without upgrading skills and the difficulty scales with the timelines what’s the point of having the green diamonds if it’s only for the cards? Seems pointless to even have the skill potions if that’s the case, I never even got to take full advantage of it, if I knew it was going to disappear I would’ve spent more time grinding my skills. Bring back the purchase of skill potions or the game will be unplayable. I also liked that you could buy boss dungeon keys I think you should just add every dungeon key to be able to be purchased so you can choose the play-style you want to play most. Skill potion purchase is a must though otherwise the game will be wayyy too grindy, that’s the only reason I’m giving a 1 star, I’ll make it 5 stars if you bring back the skill potion purchase Last advice is to ad a no ads purchase, if I could get the same rewards as watching an ad without having to watch an ad I would gladly buy the no ads purchase granted it’s not too expensive. Still need to bring back skill potion purchase"
5,Leakkye,"The thing that makes this game fun is the events it has, yes, normal progression is slow as heck, but as soon as you start doing some events and you start getting gems and potions, then, it speeds it up by a little bit. The best feature about this game is that ads aren’t forced on you, you have to click a button that says it’ll give you an ad for you to actually get the ad. There’s one bad thing about it and it’s when you get past timeline 16, the enemies are just way too difficult and you have to start logging in every day to do dungeons and bosses. Red potions are also too difficult to get, you finally beat story mode, but then it just becomes super hard and practically impossible to beat. Still giving this game a 5/5 because of how fun. It’s not a flashy game that gives you ads every few seconds, it’s just simple and fun, like the way mobile games are meant to be. They’re meant to able to be played as you go on through your day, not be played on constantly."
4,Random$?,"Game is amazing (only if ur not trying to get to the end fast) it’s slow yes but I like it I would look at my games and notice it and play it for like 30 mins trying to get farther it’s better then before cause I’m not gonna lie the first level took like a week to get past but it’s better (I think I can’t really go back) and most of the problems with the reviews is just the first level, there are no ads like 0 ads u can always watch one to progress but it’s better to go for the cards they help less then instant progression but they help in the long run, example: when u go against the same people u have the extra health or damage will have u always win a 1 v 1, so just send one at the start and at least get far. Conclusion: it’s not a bad game when u start seeing the replay ability, u start feeling like ur a god when u go against ur old enemies, Actual Conclusion: get past start and don’t play all the time have it as a idle game instead of a game👍🏾"
3,ExoToxMan,"A game where watching ads is simply the best use of your time to progress. Other than that this has been an enjoyable game for a few days.  However I realized that there was something wrong. You gain “cards” that give your units passive bonuses like +% damage and +% health that, in theory, should give you an edge in matchups.  I currently have +168% damage and +128% health. You would think this would give me a nice advantage but you’d be wrong. After my most recent move to the next time line, my basic soldiers were *losing* one on one matchups with the same enemy unit. Meaning they had less health and damage than the enemy. Despite my huge passive boosts. I got another couple of cards and they then seemed to be evenly matched. So at first I thought the boosts weren’t doing anything, but I was wrong, it’s worse. The computer enemies are also getting passive boosts and the boosts you get are just there to let you keep up. And the only way to max out those boosts is to watch ads.  It’s a really crappy design and it sticks that it isn’t made clear that this is how it works."
1,hcih oj igcys,"When you first look at the game you can see the potential is there. Fighting with lines of archers and horsemen and warriors, but as you go along the game almost has no skill aspect, its almost not even worth it to play archers at all, and the warrior people maybe a little if you need to get something in quick. I think the game would be a lot more fun if there were maybe separate food bars for each type if unit witch would add to the skill aspect of the game. Maybe buff the warrior at least. Almost the only way to really win… or just get more money, is to spam the big guy. Also the upgrade base health is almost useless as it just gets destroyed anyways when the get too it because they start spawning like 20 people every 5 seconds when can only get like 1 per 10 seconds. I know that the point is to upgrade, but even then, you get to the end of their line, destroy the camp, and move on to getting destroyed again.  Secondly the game is way too add based, watch adds to double your pay, double speed, get more summons (the only way to get them is with real money or adds),And it takes absurdly long with out watching all the adds."
1,>>Ash1138<<,"It amazes me that so many mediocre games riddled with obnoxious ads receive near 5-star reviews. It’s so hard to find good games when the App Store just about every game is rated as great.  Here was my experience: Level 1, not enough resources so impossible to win. Watch an ad to get some coins to get better resource production. Replay level 1. Lose again. Watch another ad, spend more coins, and replay again. Lose again. Repeat, only on third try ad option appears in match for extra resources (ie a cheat). Still not enough. Lose again. Repeat. This time I had enough coins to buy new troop type so I don’t watch in game ad. Lose again. Repeat, only this time I watch in game ad for cheat resources. Still lose. This is level 1 mind you.   Im sure I’ll win with enough ad watching, and it’s possible to win without ads if you want to grind it out insanely slow. You don’t win with skill in this game. You win by having high enough resource production which is achieved between matches by spending coins. And the fastest way to get coins is by watching ads. Screw this game and all those like it, and shame to all those who give games like this 5-star ratings."
4,peerper show,"I love this concept but the ads are horrible. I get that the developers want money but are all the ads necessary? You NEED to watch ads to even have a chance in this game. You barely get any coins so most of your coins come from ads. The coins only go towards getting a new timeline, getting 1 additional hp, unlocking 2 more towers; 2 towers because one is free, and a minor food buff that is useless. There are just way too many ads. A solution could be adding a buff to the free coins, earned from playing the game. Power is not right in the game. I have to play matches to beat the other opponents but these opponents can 2 shot or even 1 shot me. This is where the buff to free coins comes in. I would not have to watch an ad, unless wanted. I would have to play less matches to have a chance to win, unlike the many matches I have to play right now with the current version of the game. Please fix the coin issue and the power."
4,Big hehehshe,"This was interesting at the start and I thought that it was a unique type of game. Unlike other siege or empire games that need empire power or whatnot this game didn’t need that. Instead it was more of a grinding game that keeps you motivated to keep going. I myself just got this game and is already addicted to it! The gameplay and way everything looks is very immaculate and I’d love to see more! Very well made 5 stars. Update a few days later, not gonna lie after the farmer area everything is just so flipping slow. Like it takes ages to get passed an era. The only thing that I see that is unfair are the food/base health. Like no mater how fast your food is you’ll never be able to beat the ai, and no mater how strong your base is it takes like 6 hits to get knocked down! Not to mention the ai spawns like a million troops and you only have like two xd. Overall still a great game, though Maybe Change it to: We Are Grinders, 4 stars 👍."
2,brruhhhhhhhhhhh,"It’s pretty fun and they have all the right pieces to be an amazing game but they made it incredibly repetitive and dependent on ads to make progress like most games nowadays, the food progression cost to summon troops gets ridiculously expensive and it’s just an insulting 0.02 speed increase that you might as well just evolve instead and one shot everything which takes all the fun out of upgrading your units but turns the game into just grinding for money slowly and watching ads to get enough cash to evolve, lastly theirs no speed up option so you just have to sit through the long repetitive fight over and over and over again so you can upgrade or evolve, and when you finally do evolve and win the level it’s just the same exact repetition from the last fight of grinding for more cash to evolve while they send the same troops with different skins with more health and damage if it weren’t so dependent on ads and repetitive I would’ve given 5 stars because I really wanted to like this game but it becomes a chore to play so fast."
5,4lw4ys M4ving,"Played it until i passed it. No need to pay to win, only watch a hand full of ads to speed things up. Way at the end it opens up special events similar to the ads for this game. Like horde vs cave men, soldiers vs Kaiju monster. U get special gear for successful wins. I lost interest after end of game. Thats just me, it has an option to reset game stage. I was in my meh mentality i get into after passing a game. Im sure it has more to offer on replays. Im more of a hard n near impossible puzzle game n strategy game addict. Love me some; Kingdoms, Rebuild 3, final outpost is similar to this just crazy harder, Lilys garden believe it or not? Gets crazy hard past 200, i just love punishing games. Speaking of which, This game has that leveling system like Souls like games where loosing makes you stronger. I enjoyed my tome with this game, give it a try. I will come back to it in the future see whats new."
3,I couldn’t find any,"This game completely bores me at the start, in fact it’s almost like a “pay to win game” it’s really rigged at the start and looks absolutely nothing like the ads that I’ve seen for this game. It’s not fair that at the first battle it literally took me MONTHS to complete it. After I competed the first battle i went to the next battle the second after I played one round I was completely done. round I was done and deleted the game. Why did the first battle take so long? Well it’s because the other team has 500 health! On the positive side the graphics are very creative, I love the different designs of the evolutions, and honestly, it’s a very delightful creative game to play. I love the different weapons, and the cute little characters, and most of all the little dinosaur that that caveman rides. i’m deeply sorry if this affected your ratings badly, but please fix the rigged levels. But overall, it’s a fun game I just couldn’t have it with the rigged levels. Thank you for your time to read this review."
2,Shrek985,"The game is obviously inspired by Age of Empires which got me excited. However there’s only ever three units you can choose from on every stage. A melee, ranged, and ranged tanky unit. Super repetitive and yea it doesn’t force you to watch ads however you literally won’t be able to progress reasonably without watching ads. Your base will almost always be a one hit while your opponent has insane base health. You can get cards that increase troop health and damage but only through gems which you can only get through purchasing or completing all the daily challenges that add up to 200 gems. To buy a card it costs 100 gems so that’s only 2 cards a day. It’s just the same song and dance oh getting smoked by your opponent until you can produce fast enough to push large armies of the tanky-ranged units. Just not a lot of replay potential or content. Could’ve been a super fun game but it’s ultimately an ad farm like ever other app game. Also don’t buy gems because you’ll delete the game after 3-5 days anyway. Trust me."
2,Mrorange33,"One major problem with this game is the events. The race is fun, and can provides good rewards, however it should match you up with other players that are close to your upgraded skill level. If a player has upgraded skills, cards, and more that is much higher than another player they will advance faster and to a much higher level. This only allows them to gather more awards and advance faster. A very simple solution just match players with similar skill level. The other extra games, chess, space, underwater can be extremely difficult to advance. Adding a way to get more blue potions might help. They should be challenging but not impossible. Would also like to see the units not bunch up on the field of play, adjust how they line up on the field, spread them out. Would make a difference. If the events are not fixed, I really can’t see playing much longer. The Race has been ruined. This is no longer a game that is fun to play. Bye.  No Response from developers?"
1,GamePlayer2757,"Other reviewers have said it as well but the progression is abysmal. If you don’t want to bombarded by ads, you will take exponentially longer to play through the game so get comfy looking at cavemen for a while.   If you use the ads at every available opportunity you’ll make it to the 2nd stage pretty quick and get to see the re-skinned first units but more expensive. The gameplay isn’t different in this stage or any beyond. I believe it’s at this section where you can watch ad to speed up the game to 1.5x speed making it generally more enjoyable for a meager 5 minutes until you have to watch another ad. It was also at this time when I meandered to the shop to see what sort of silliness is happening there and I found that you can get a permanent 1.5 speed up for a whole ELEVEN DOLLARS. I stopped right after that, like cmon. This game is purely for money and ads, it’s barely anything beyond that.   You have to devote an ungodly amount of time to do anything and all of the mechanics are half baked and barely worth paying attention to. Don’t play."
4,goshhowinteresting,"I love this game! The first thing you notice is that there is no forced adds. I hate games that say have no adds, then they really do have them, now obviously if you would like to watch an add for better rewards you can. It’s just good that there is REALLY no adds in this game. I would also definitely recommend it for a long car rides because it requires no WiFi. The only downside is that it takes a while to level up your ages and it’s hard, personally I like a challenge. But other then that it’s really fun. It’s a good way to pass time. If you like challenging games then this is the game for you. It gives a good challenge, and also it’s not to hard. I like that because it balances giving a bit of a challenge, while also allowing the game not to be impossible. Overall I’m very impressed. If your looking for a good game this is were to go!"
5,Kyle242226,"This game is really fun. The only problem is when the enemy ranged units are inside their base and wipe your 8 stack of ranged and you just have to sit there and watch bc they can’t be hit. Ranged units should be able to hit the units inside of the base. It also would benefit from some kind of attack speed upgrade as the most fun timelines and ages are ones with units with fast attack speeds or AOE attacks. Runes also feel extremely hard to get for how big the tune tree is. Events should have access to the rune tree at least as they seem so extremely hard due to how quickly the difficulty ramps up. Additionally some rework to the main “campaign” needs to be done as at about timeline 40 the difficulty multiplier increases so quickly that putting 10,000 gems into the upgrades only shows a large increase in power for abt 2 timelines"
5,Bad game For ipod,"This game is very fun, no ads unless you want to level easily. I personally didn’t watch much of the x2 ad rewards because I like grinding. The comments are all saying how this game is ad reliant because you can’t level if you don’t watch ads, which is NOT true. These people are probably wanting to complete a game less than 5 minutes… the game is designed to grind. Personally, I was stuck on stage one for probably 30-60 minutes. This is not saying the game was boring. I actually liked it. I had to grind to level my food production. I’ve been playing for about 3-4 hours and I am on stage 3. I love this game so far and honestly I don’t mind watching ads to support the game. Some feedback I would give is make the levels randomized. I think it helps make it more interesting. Or maybe make it random after every reset."
3,Rose13666,To be honest the game is good but it does come with a few frustrations. Basically you start off really weak fight a battle you’ll never win. You don’t get a lot of coins unless you hit the base but at the start thats hard. Once you are able to up grade your speed of which you get meat to get your people or even leveling your base up goes from cheap to pricey in one or two upgrades. Now there are ways around the money problem. You can at times watch an add to get more meat at the beginning to make more of the guys. Which at that point you can destroy the other base but like I said you’ll maybe make 600 from that but the upgrades go from 300 to 600 in one go. So you’ll be watching a lot of adds and that’s where they get you. Now alone the game itself doesn’t have to many adds so if you chose not to play the adds you don’t have to worry about them popping up to much. All in all not bad but a little frustrating.
5,Vibin_Slugcat,"I’m at timeline 20 right now, and if I’m being honest, this game WAS an ad grind. Even though all ads are optional (developers deserve RESPECT for that) the first couple timelines I was watching ads for that 2x boost, but after unlocking multiple VERY useful things I stopped doing that. The game became less of an ad grind and more of an actual game, which I enjoy playing.  If you want to get to the REAL stuff, you need to get through the first couple of timelines. I wasn’t a big fan of the grind there, but after unlocking enough things, the game became a breeze, and whenever enemy units became more powerful than mine, I could just wait then get more of those green diamonds to get more. Keep in mind that if the game gets too hard, you can always wait until tomorrow to try doing more dungeons, daily missions, etc."
1,Topic014,"In the early stages of the game, you make good progress, but as you advance further, a major issue arises. The AI controlling your troops performs poorly, often causing you to lose close battles. The aiming mechanic is problematic, as if the primary target is eliminated, the subsequent attack misses instead of targeting another unit. As the game progresses, the enemy's multipliers increase, making it crucial to watch ads for extra resources to acquire more cards and upgrades. Overall, the game lacks depth and strategic requirements until you reach higher levels, such as Legends and Boss dungeons. Success in these levels depends more on the levels of your cards, upgrades, and skills rather than strategic gameplay. If you lack the necessary levels, you won't be able to progress without either investing a significant amount of money or grinding extensively. It's clear that the game's primary goal is to generate revenue, and while I would be willing to invest in it if more effort were put into its development, it currently feels like a cash grab."
4,FishyFinThing,"It’s a game similar to Age of War on flash. I find that the strategy to beat the game is to focus on advancing age instead of trying to beat the AI with the same tech. If you feel like you can advance within 10 fight than go ahead and saving because the enemy has already maxed production and base health. They also use a cheap trick of hiding behind the base and snipe your unit even if they aren’t that strong without cover. There are different kind of unit but it’s all come in three types:   The melee one which is bad even if they are tier 3. They will die before reaching any unit with decent range. And have no chance reaching a group of ranged units even if they have good armor.  The range one which is ok if they are low health and numerous but bad if they are tier 3 because they die faster then the cost to build.  The AoE one which is insanely strong no matter  the tier. They can kill those annoying range unit hiding behind the base.  Overall an addicting game. Progression sometimes slow if your current age have bad units. For example, in World War age, I beat the AI easily with tier 2 AoE. But the next age, I have to use those stupid melee again and lose to the previous World War age when their tier 1 is already ranged and tier 2-3 is AoE."
5,Ahanaz85,"This game is so much fun and I’ve become obsessed with it. Love that it’s dynamic in how you chose to use the money, and you have to strategize. Love the cute drawings! I mean those dinosaurs? How can you not love them?  I also must say thank you for making the game fair and wanting to play. There are ads but it’s on the players terms. No forced ads, but each round you get to choose if you want/have time to watch one to get doubled money from the round. The PLAYERS choose to watch for faster speed etc.   And THANK YOU dear developer for making the boost you get from watching ads only tick when you activate the new round! I can actually watch it, and still have credit from it should I get a phone call or need to do something between rounds. 5 min boost is actually 5min gameplay. So I can upgrade and maximize my attempts to beat a level each round without losing valuable time.   Some things I miss: - being able to pause a round when I get interrupted. Given they are not long, sometimes things still come up at inconvenient times, and hitting pause would be really nice in those situations.   - be able to stack up the speed boost, eg watch 3 ads in a row for a 15min boost total. Somehow 5min feels so much shorter than usual haha"
3,DOLLARGENERAL666,"So I have a few complaints, one being the dungeon, I don’t have any keys and it’s already been a day, I just downloaded yesterday, and another thing, how am i supposed to level up the cards if I don’t get enough of the currency to do so? I like the game and it seems enjoyable so far, but these few things just don’t make sense to me, and then there’s timeline cards.   When I play each timeline, it said I’d unlock more cards as I continue playing, so I don’t know if the stages give me that or id have to save up the currency to do so, it’s hard to have to wait many days and save up just to level them once or twice, or is just my end that’s becoming a problem? I don’t understand what’s going on and it’s quite frustrating, I would rate it higher, but I want other playable options within the game, such as the zombie dungeon but it doesn’t even let me do that."
3,Weston117,"You can easily play for free, i got to the 3rd timeline in a couple hours. Pretty slow start but gains momentum. My grip with the game is the “emeralds”, you are given 1000 at the start to pull 10 hero cards that give marginal buffs each lvl you have on the card. Everyday you can do 5 daily quest each giving 50ish emerald for a total of 250 a day (the last daily is to watch 5 ads so if you dont like ads its only 200/day). Other than the dailies you only get emeralds by buying them. It takes multiple card pulls in order to get duplicates to upgrade a card. So by playing for free itll take around a week to upgrade one card for a 5% bonus in HP/ATK and such. I only use my phone when im waiting or bored at work so I like to play for an hour at a time but in the long run this game is repetitive with no new unit variants. Its a weak melee, a ranger and a hard hitting tank. Thats it every age you go up."
2,Bribed with money,"I understand that coding intelligent AI is resource intensive and probably not viable on mobile devices. This makes cheating the best option for adjusting difficulty in games. I have no problem with that (heck I play Civilization on diety difficulty. That’s the epitome of a cheating AI opponent.). The AI in this game doesn't just cheat incredibly hard. It cheats in a way that is impossible to combat with strategic thought. Spawning units at a rate 200x faster than the player in a game like this is not difficult, its punishing. This makes the game incredibly frustrating and unrewarding to play. Compare this to a game like Civilization V. In Civ V, the AI does cheat in a similar way on harder difficulties. However, the game is formatted such that strategic though and planning can overcome the initial disadvantage. This has none of that satisfying outplay potential. The only solution is to grind harder. This is lazy game design and disappoints me (mainly because a modern version of age of war sounds really cool). What a shame. 2/5"
4,Fartologist69,"The mechanics, progression and gameplay are pretty okay the only things I can complain about are how hard it is to obtain cards, events and how we have to watch ads to complete the daily missions.   You only get about 650 gems a day, 200 on just ads, 200+ on dungeons (very hard to get more and if you get it it’s only 2-3 more) and 200 on daily missions which includes having to watch 5 MORE ADS. Those gems are used to get cards 100 gems- 1 card. 6 cards a day is simply not enough to get past a couple levels.   The race events aren’t okay but are very dependent on how much you have unlocked on the skill tree(which you can only upgrade 4 times a day max, most days you can’t even unlock more because of lack of skill point which are very hard to obtain), the top couple  places are fair but after 5th and 10th place it drops off a lot.  The other world events are so short and you only get about 1350 gems and 90 blue potions. It’s far too short, please add  a couple more levels   In conclusion, kind of a ad farm but it gets easier after a while. No forced ads or anything like that but it does heavily influence you to watch them"
5,Winnrman,"When you look at this game, you probably see an age of war clone for the phone, and you’d be partially correct, but this game takes that concept further with the addition of different ages, different timelines, abilities, events and passive buffs you get through leveling.   At times, it is very ad-heavy in the sense that with the 2x coin boost after every game, it’s a lot quicker to progress, but the game never forces you to watch ads, which has earned my respect, and I may even consider purchasing some green-gem-things to show my consideration towards the devs.   Overall, a game which is easy to pick up, fun to play for small spurts throughout the day, and one which will not be quickly uninstalled, like so many others of its type."
5,yay loulou kids,"So I downloaded this game seeing the adds thinking they looked so cool, but was a bit disappointed with it. Then I started playing it. It would be nice if it started out a little easier, because 1 health to 500 health and basic cavemen versus maxed out cave civilization. One day my best friend came over to my house and we played this game sharing half the screen. I tried to convince her to come draw or do a craft because she had to leave soon, but she was addicted!!! We loved playing it together, and she is coming over again today! I love this game and how it takes it slow so you don’t immediately fly through the levels and I love the style of the game, and if you want my opinion, you should download this game to play too."
2,qwertyuiuiuiuyg,"Game is fun up until after timeline one. Your still stuck with 3 units that have the same purpose throughout and no real changes besides dungeons. Upgrading cards do essentially nothing because you still have to watch adds to be able to spam the most expensive units to even win, there’s no strategy because your always at a disadvantage. Spawning your basic unit becomes useless after you unlock the most expensive because the only way to win is to spam them. Not to mention it’s completely riddled with adds that you have to watch to make any progress. I don’t mind the simple nature of it and the design of the characters is fine it’s just the gameplay itself that boring with no actual thought involved. Also leveling up your castle health is useless and a complete waste of money because all it does is give you basically one more hit from an enemy."
5,GoatNamedBilly,"Please add more content please add more I really enjoy this game but make more stuff to make this game alive like for example add more game content more stuff  for ftp to players to English cause the scaling is insane and also the game need more stuff beside hero’s. Skills , cards to scale please don’t give up on this game developers add more stuff to word towards this game don’t give up on it add new races to play go indept on this game please jus add to this game to make people to continue to play this why this doesn’t just die off but I really like this game just wanted to give my opinion on this game it’s really fun but they made the. Scaling insane and there isn’t really too much to Enjoy later on"
5,TheHonestDeed,Slow start but very rewarding when you hit a goal. It would be nice if you could keep your economy upgrades after you evolve but balance and shizznips 🤷‍♂️ Ps You choose when to watch a advertisement and get rewarded for watching a full video. By the way that is the only time you see a advertisement. It’s up to you if you wish to see one at all. I spend more time playing the game than playing cat and mouse with the tiny little exit button. It feels amazing knowing that I’m not going to get bombarded with pointless adds that I have no interest in. It’s great!! It is literally how advertising should be done!!!
3,RutheeLex,"- health bar for enemies need to be a different color. Should’ve been a no brainer from the start.    - are the meanings “battle” and “age” the same in this game? If so, pick one of the words and use it universally to avoid confusion.    - on the timeline page, each battle/age should be numbered so you don’t have to scroll to see where you’re at. It’s lazy on our part but an easy fix on yours.   - we need more skills. 8 is absolutely not enough. Maybe new ones can unlock after you’ve passed a certain number of timelines    - the hero and all of their powers are weak rn. It’s a great theory but the execution is horrible. Takes 300 gems to get a new one and it might be worse than the ones you already have???? My blood is boiling. No reason for why that should be happening. Their quests need to have a better success rate and they overall should be enhanced.   - can we pretty please get more maps for events? The same 4 over and over are not doing it for us anymore hah.  - why are we not able to use the skills/runes tabs in races and events? We instead have to exit the event and race to change skills, etc. Makes NO sense!    - NO. MORE. SEXUAL. ADS!!!!!!!!! Little kids are playing this game!! For the love of god PLEASE."
3,Marg K,"This has been my fidget game for about a month, so I guess I must admit I overall enjoy it. I have no problem with the prevalence of ads (we all gotta make money somehow and this App Store is saturated with adware games, so it’s nice to have a game where all the ads are voluntary), but it’s frustrating that progression is constantly grinding to a halt because of timers that only reset once per day. I’m excited to explore the “Hero” mechanic, but I’m being stun-locked because at this point my troops are too weak for the Timeline and all my means for improving them are tightly controlled by missions I can only do 4 times per day. I would love to see something done about this (like not limiting the number of ads I can watch, or stretching it to 5 so I could do the missions 7x/day) and I’d happily improve my review score"
2,Howard(@),"It starts off fun with a nice balance of difficulty and progression, but quickly becomes a chore. The only way to get enough coins to progress is watching an ad after every round. You’ll also be watching an ad every few minutes to keep the game at a reasonable speed.   Before long you’ll be playing the same level multiple times and watching an ad after each run so that you can buy a .02/sec increase in production. I guess the idea is that you’re supposed to spend money buying cards to buff your units. The problem is those buffs aren’t useful unless I assume you drop hundreds of dollars into buying cards. I hit the progression wall at timeline 3 of 15, so I’m guessing a significant investment would just push the wall back a timeline or two.   It’s a shame. The art style is cute. The gameplay is simple yet fun.  There some neat ideas like the skills and dungeons and cards, but in the end you’ll spend most of your time watching the same level only to finally pass it…so you can watch the next level even longer.   Put in an option to skip all the ads for a one time $5-$7 charge.  Maybe add another $5 charge to permanently 10x coins or 2x meat and I’d have bought those and would still be playing. As it is, after a day of constant ads, no thanks."
4,\m/😲\m/,"I’ve been playing this game for about a month now, and I have to say it’s maintained my ADHD attention the entire time.   You’re *never* forced to watch ads, but they do offer ads for additional bonuses. Which, I actually think is awesome because sometimes it really gives you the boost you need and I assume it helps the creators out! I can’t stress enough how much I love the ability to completely avoid the ads if you wish.   There are very frequent game-wide events that you can play for additional upgrades, and the game actually has a really in-depth bonus system. It’s very RPG-like, allowing both overarching bonuses for the entire-game, as well as short term bonuses for momentary progression.   My only real feedback if anyone reads these is:  1. I would suggest something along the lines of either a “tip/hint” system at the beginning, or maybe even a full-on tutorial level at the beginning. As a new player, there’s definitely a bit of a learning curve that more casual players may struggle to figure out.   2. I will literally pay an add-on for an Alien and Predator level LOL  I love the game and don’t see myself stopping anytime soon!"
2,Global Age,"Title says it all. This is the same gameplay from Age Of War, an old flash game you can get on mobile now, but with ads. The ads are 'optional' as far as I can tell so far, but the gameplay forces you to want to watch ads for more gold, to speed up the gameplay (yes, the gameplay is so slow that you are basically forced to watch an ad for 5min of 1.5x play), and for Gems which allow you to buy heroes for tiny stat boosts. I've already been playing for an hour+ and have only gotten to Renaissance Age and Battle 4 and I've watched like every ad I can to give me a boost. The only thing this has over Age Of War is that the units move around to their left and right, so you can have your guys surround the enemy if you have more than they do.   So unless that one positive (that I've encountered) has your attention, I recommend not wasting your time."
4,jackacered,"This game is a grind, but not in a bad way.  Not gonna lie, you’ll be replaying various stages multiple times until you get the right combination of upgrades and strategy to progress.  Despite that, there’s enough content to keep you interested.   I’m on timeline 4 and I’m very interested to see what ages are yet to come in future time lines.  I wish there was an idle component to food generation, even at an extremely low rate.  One big negative so far is Events are nearly unplayable unless you’re willing to pay money or watch ad after ad.   And just recently we’re no longer able to spend green tokens on skill potions.  That’s a bit of a bummer.  Overall, a fun game that will challenge you and hopefully make you smile."
3,iMrReMember,The problem comes when you need to grind money in order to upgrade your production. Theres no idle income. So you HAVE to do the same thing over and over and over and over again. Just to get a .2 upgrade to production. Which youll need a ton of and the price of the upgrade gets expensive FAST. The only other upgrade you can get costs gems to open cards. You can only get 400 gems a day and they cost 100 per card. Ive bought 8 cards and it was all the same card. Which isnt very helpful. Now im stuck grinding gold until i can get my production high enough that i can buy enough troops to keep up with the ridiculous amount of troops the opponent has. Which means ill be stagnant for an extremely long time. Probably would take a month with no progression. So the games done for me.
4,ggaammeedq,"It is so hard to find games nowadays that don’t force you to watch ads every 30 seconds, however this game doesn’t. Instead, you can watch ads to claim rewards, which i’m all down for. However, like many other ratings of this game, it it pretty clear from the start that you require a long attention span, or at least some hard work and dedication, to make it anywhere in this game. It’s fun, classic, but too hard! The extremely hard levels at the very beginning of the game makes players feel discouraged and bored. Many games are fun when the player actually succeeds at something. I’ve only been playing for a few days, but for now, 4 stars!"
4,Just being honest🤷🏼‍♂️,"It’s a fun game that’s very simple, I’d love to spend more time playing it but due to the lack of ways to earn new things in the game, I have to wait a full day in between short sessions of playing because the daily challenges are pretty much the only way to earn upgrades and things. If there was way a way for me to find new challenges or items to earn, quicker than watching full ads and waiting 24 hours for, then the play time on this game would be a lot higher/longer. I hope the developers take note of what I’ve mentioned, a great resource for in game inspiration would be the game golf battle on the App Store. Plenty of ways to earn new items and upgrades."
5,Nolan R B,"This game starts off slow and tedious but once you put a few hours and get into it, this game becomes insanely fun. You lose track of time and next thing you know it’s 2-3 hours later. Every time you proceed to the next timeline the game just keeps getting better and better, especially once you unlock all the dungeons. Best way to describe it , is that this game is a scaled down version of age of empires that you can play on the go and play in 5 minute increments whenever you have some time to kill. Highly recommend for someone who wants to play a fun game that require a little bit of strategy ."
5,Garry8ball,"I like how the game has barely any ads, (or none at all.) It has good graphics, fun gameplay, and interesting plan for the game, how it is a simulator, but also an attack game. The little characters are extremely cute and not that expensive. The levels are really hard, forcing you to play the level multiple times (which isn’t annoying at all) and letting you create a game plan and have to learn from your mistakes!  In summary, this app is truly the best non-wifi game I have played, or even in the world! I definitely recommend to play, you’ll get sucked in through seconds!! If you’re looking for a fun no ad and no wifi game, this app is for you!!"
5,Katakeysis,"Playing this game is like watching Phineas and Ferb- it’s the same formula over and over again, with just enough variability to keep things interesting. I’ve been playing this game for an hour or two for over a month, and I’m still enjoying it. The only money I’ve spent is for the permanent speed upgrade, and I didn’t feel like I needed to buy that, I just wanted to support the developer. I also support them by watching ads, but watching ads is always a choice, and there’s a really nice, but not strictly necessary, benefit for doing so. Great game design, and great monetization design. What more could you ask for in a mobile game?"
5,MrNewdl,"The gameplay is definitely inspired by age of war, and I’m here for it! The main flaw with the gameplay is the repetitive and slow nature of progression; it seems the developers are currently trying to add unfolding features to make the game less monotonous, and I’m here for it.  Small technical note; in the zombie dungeons sometimes the zombies will attack your base even when you have a strong defense built up if they are touching your base and not close enough to your units to attack them, and this can be frustrating.  Overall, if you are a fan of the incremental (and soon unfolding, hopefully) genre, definitely worth a download."
5,Cooper T Hewitt,"I absolutely love this game and how it goes on-and-on-and-on. There are some bugs that I would absolutely love to get fixed though (Both being through the advertisements)  1- Whenever I am somewhere between 3-5 seconds in an ad, the game crashes and I lose whatever I watched the ad for and if I used the “watch ad for 2x coins” I lose the coins I was going to get in the first place. 2- After an ad, the audio cuts. Both of these are usually on or after 2 ads I’ve watched before I reset the app because it crashes or the audio cuts. Please fix this, but I’m still leaving 5 stars because it’s still a great game!"
3,Hatter33,"This game is fun up until you see the small flaws that cause the game to become boring.   Pros: This fame brings back memories of playing Age of War on the floor or my childhood living room. It is easy to master and fun to come back to after a short break. There is so much creativity put into this game that it is sad to see it blacked behind ads that you have to watch if you want the pace of play to go faster than a snails pace. I want to see this game go somewhere.   Cons: the Gem system is poor when you can only get about 200 per day without ads and 400 with about 4 ads. It also use to be 100 gems per daily mission but now it is only 40.  I have also noticed that your own troops focus a single unit each where as the enemy units focus only one of your troops so if you have a 2v2 situation the  the enemy troops focus one of your two while yours target one each which makes your troops die really quick. 100% of the time I lose a 2v2 because of this.  It is also very grindy, like 2-3 days worth of work to beat the same evolution as you.   Overall I do like the game just hope these little flaws can be fixed to make it better."
1,DINIXEXII,"Both-Requirement1505  I can’t imagine a worse change.   There’s a reason that I played this game, and it was that I had sped it up to 2x speed by purchases. The game moves like molasses in midwinter without that 2x speed. I will not make any purchases in the future, nor will I play or watch more ads. I have spent a couple hundred on this game, and while I’m no whale I have spent enough to feel angry.   What’s the point of a coin bonus for someone who spends money on progression? I can either beat a level, or I can wait for more cards/potions/gear/other bonuses, or I can pay for more cards. The game is entirely unplayable at normal speed, and I’m insulted by a coin bonus as a replacement for my two purchases into speed (which still leaves me YET ANOTHER coin bonus purchase somehow) and the addition of a distracting, garbage roulette wheel that requires 5 ads to get rid of every day, and a game that’s unplayably slow.  I’d love to play more of the game as it used to be, but I suspect that they won’t revert it. They might increase the base speed for everyone, but then what of my previous purchases? Equal value reward in something else? Maybe. A coins bonus is definitely garbage though.  I’m open to suggestions I suppose, but as things are the game is unplayable."
5,the ad was a lie,In the review I’m talking about they state that the upgrades you get apply to the “ai” which the ai is just a base that spawns the same units each round no matter what and the ai doesn’t get the upgrades they say you can’t beat the “ai” in a fair fight but you can ive doen it several times it jsut takes strategy in conclusion if the review states any of these previous things are true they are just fools who did not actually bother to test or get past first evolution or ad fools who are just fools that don’t bother to actually be able to back up their claims and can’t figure out to use the pea that they call a brain
5,ckicken nuggtz,This is my 2nd review. I am on timeline 2 and I have new things to say.  One thing I need to mention about is how there are absolutely no ads unless you ask for it.  My only criticism to this game is that battle 6 in timeline 1 is too grindy because most battles are won by overpowering the enemy with the next era. Battle 6 is the last era so you can’t just get the next empire to win easily. You have to grind a lot to upgrade food production which kinda forces you to watch ads for 2x coins. It wasn’t really fun when this happened to me but at least I’m done with it. Still 5 stars tho.   On timeline 2 you unlock much more things. First of all you can go through dungeons which give you green coins. In these dungeons you already have pre set upgrades and characters to fight with. The way to win is to kill all the zombies which vary from the different eras in timeline 1. Also I’d like to point out how in timeline 2 you get to play in different eras like the Neolithic age instead of the Stone Age.  Overall just a great game.
3,PeachGobbler12:,"I played this game for a few days and it is very fun and replayable, but the timelines get repetitve, there are only 3 warrior cards you can choose from, and events are either pay to win race events or very hard progression events that take too long for very little reward. I had fun playing until I got too used to how the game works, it needs new elements further down the progression timeline of the player to keep a game like this fresh. A small suggestion from me would be to change how the skill tree works because some of it is something like additional base hp, and then further down the skill tree you get... more base hp. Instead, put all base hp into one circle and make it exponentially cost more the more points you put in"
1,_chimp_,"The game is really slow if you don’t watch ads. I’ve never been able to beat the computer in a fair fight where we’re in the same age (like Bronze Age).   I thought I was getting better by collecting gems to buy special upgrades, but it turns out the computer gets these upgrades too.  The problem with the gems is you basically have to watch ads to get them. You can do daily quests, but today the second daily quest I got was to watch 5 ads.  There are two ads you can watch for more gems.  There’s also horde mode that offers gems but the difficulty scales so fast that you can’t get more gems unless you spend gems to get upgrades, and then you only get a few gems back.   The only way to truly progress in this game would be to watch ads every day and don’t play any of the battles, because once you beat them and start the next timeline (which is just a reskinned restart), the enemy gets harder. So just watch ads and don’t play the game, because that’s how the developers intended it to be played.   This game will make you feel like Sisyphus, with the exception that every time the boulder rolls back down, it gets heavier, the hill gets taller, and there are more ads on the way to the top."
5,Kkcocobear,"That’s my favorite part. But also hands down the most relaxing yet engaging and so very enjoyable game ever. The only game that’s never been deleted.  Honestly never write a review but I’ve been playing it for…. Honestly I don’t know I’ve changed phones tho so at least a few months. And I have the attention span of a gold fish.  Also side thing, I feel like because I get to pick when I watch the ads I watch more of them AND I’m willing to try the apps or products I see in the adds. So plus one for business purposes. Definitely would invest in this app/group/creator"
5,jayjay2120,"You’re not forced on any ads and all of the ads are either helpful or really progress you a lot, it’s a time consuming game which any good game is, and tons of content within each timeline. Everything makes sense and actual thought was put into this. Very little micro transactions and side missions are challenging like they should be. Great game overall.  Edit: most of these reviews comment on not being able to do damage or are getting hit so easily and dying is because you need to upgrade your cards to be willing to do more damage and have more health."
3,Jax Offston,"Let me start by saying I love the design of the game, simplistic yet effective. The game is fun abs has me hooked. But however, this is basically “Age of War” from the flash era of games that is just broken up into segments to extend playtime. I can appreciate the difficulty at times, but it can be outright unfair how the AI can be sometimes. Albeit that’s the point of grinding out the coins per session, BUT (this is common theme at this point) it almost emphasizes as watching to make proper progress even though it’s optional. Thankfully the ads are not forced. Proper balancing in progression would make this way better, or perhaps if it was one big play session where you evolve in game instead of little segments where you evolve between them"
4,CJvosh,"I literally uninstalled 99 out of 100 games that I install because they’re all too easy too fast and are designed for either kids or stupid ppl. But this game was a breath of fresh air, right off the bat you’re struggling and are challenged to improve. Update: I do have one feed back. I don’t like like that with each generation, there exactly the same 3 type of units. This makes the game repetitive. Basically all your doing is re skinning the units and giving them higher health and damage. This makes the game repetitive. Unlocking higher ages should unlock new strategies, like maybe a healer or having units that move faster."
3,Mysp0,"This is an overall fun game, but the progression is very slow without watching ads for either more coins, or more food at the start. You need to evolve once to even have the chance of beating stage 1, which makes the game super tedious and repetitive at the start, which is starting the level, dying after 5 enemies, and then buying one upgrade.  The speed at which the cave puts out enemies is also insanely fast, going from 1 beater 2x, to 2 beaters, to 3, to 2 throwers, to a dinosaur, then two more throwers, then about 5 beaters, then 5 dinosaurs, and then another 7 beaters.  If the games progression were to be sped up, and the difficulty on stage one were to be ramped down, it would have gotten more stars"
4,Lola Aradoor,"Okay, I know this game is really great. It is fun and entertaining and I actually have a challenge beating some of the levels, but there are a few things that should be known or fixed.   1. When playing the game, the START button to begin fighting is half covered up by the menu buttons. It just is very annoying to me and wish I could see the whole button itself.  2. I know you are supposed to buy no ads, but the way they give you ads every single time you lose or win is pretty annoying. I just with there wasn’t that many ads between each game.  3. When you start the game, it can be really challenging at first. You have to use your food wisely and use it for different kinds of people. But I think it is kind of unfair how different the health of the bases are. We start with the health of 2 and they start with the health of 400. That can be really challenging for me and other beginners.  Thank you for reading my review. I hope you take it into consideration and take the time to possibly improve your game."
5,Cheez Gamer,First off I must say this game is great to play on free time! I really enjoy how plain and simple this game is and how easy it is to play! There are not to many adds as well unless you would like to speed up progress by doubling coins or for the dungeons. The people saying you need to watch adds to win aren’t true you can progress quickly if you just grind. The characters are so cool and I am always very ambitious to reach the next age because I like to see the new characters. Overall a great game. Good job to the developers because this is my new favorite game. Thanks for your hard work!
3,JohnVChris,"So, I played this game and was immediately reeled in. I like grindy/idle games and honestly felt this was well done. More addicting to me than fun but I enjoyed it. I get devs make their money through ads, I ended up watching a lot of them, but I would just watch a show I had playing during them so it's not that bad.   My issue with this game is that once you finish the first 6 battles you can travel to a new timeline. And it's basically like the entire game resets, all the hardwork you put in for hours and hours is gone. I played just a bit more and decided I didn't want to start all over again. Fix this, and you'll have people continue past the first timeline."
3,Weaponer,"Another pass the time trash ad game. What annoys me the most is the loss of coin as evolve your troops. Example you start off I. The prehistoric era, and if you’re also the farming era, even with all your troops in the prehistoric era, you start back at the basic armor, and have to earn the next two levels rather than the entire troop set evolve and then you lose all your coins (even if you had leftovers). So it’s okay.   Additionally, as you increase your food productions, it seems as though the time is itself doesn’t really increase (you get extra food so rather than start off 1 after upgrading you get 5 starting off) otherwise it feels like a very slight increase. the enemy troops seem to increase pace as well."
4,MikeyGitah,"Keep in mind when releasing any updates that they should be fully tested for any bugs. I recently did the event. Completed all three levels of battle while unlocking all units and failed to receive the medal at the end. There wasn’t any error on the race event. However, on the previous event when the patch was released it failed to recognize that I had all units unlocked at battle three resulting in missing rewards. Possible solution is to add a check button to see if one: the requirement has been unlocked and if true, check if reward has been granted. Thus making sure reward is granted once and only once without error."
3,ckcteekers,"Watched an ad for extra food daily reset on the level I left off at and didn’t get my food! Thanks for that! Yea not really! Pretty far in the game for what you have to do to get through the levels, and I’m ok with that because I don’t mind watching the ads if I want the extra food or the option to take but I get without the ad, but when you put an ad to get extra food to spawn more troops to beat the level and then you don’t give me the extra food, kind of hacks me off!! I waited until morning to get the extra food at the beginning of the level so I could get past it and then you don’t even give it to me. It’s very frustrating. Thanks for screwing me out of my food!!! Smh"
4,Nathanhuang15,"Great game as stated in the title, but the 2x rewards ad (any ad option in general) is broken. Specifically, the 7 second “Hogan Tire” ad. Whenever I get this ad, it stops but there is no option to x out, the timer is just stuck at 1 second no matter what. This forces me to close out of the game and no only lose the 2x gold i would’ve gotten, but the original amount I would have gotten without the ad. This is incredibly frustrating as this ad is so common and I get it all the time. PLEASE FIX THIS. All other ads are fine and rewards are granted except for this one “Hogan Tire” ad… This has been going on for almost a week now…"
4,BeanieBoi571,"I love this game so much is because there is no forced adds. I say “forced”, because you can use adds to get double loot unlike most games forcing you to watch an add every level that is beaten. Also, the art style is very basic but unique and it can run on lower devices. One thing I would change tho is how quickly you gain meat. I think it is harder for many players that are new to the game to get fast supply, making the level harder for the early stages. I also recommend boost. The boost would just give like double coins for 5 minutes and double meat. Overall I think this game is great, it just needs a bit more content"
5,Patrick forg,Okay I had doubts but it was the best choice of my life it is so fun I love it it’s really competitive and fun I have only had this for like a month and I have played for hours every single day even in school the graphics are amazing I love it it’s so addictive my old app never get used I wake up play afternoon play even at night play every single second I play this game I love it best game besides  Minecraft but very slightly thank you for such a amazing game there is one thing I would want to see so when you go to a new generation you can keep your Progress but instant 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ keep up the good work 🙂
1,Mr.Duckets,"There are SEVERAL ads that you will watch all the way through, then it gives you the little window close “x” saying “rewards granted” but clicking the x does nothing. It’s just frozen. This happens almost every time I have to watch 2 shorter ads instead of one longer one.   This wouldn’t be a big deal except there are CRUCIAL times when watching an ad doubles your reward after beating a tough level and you need those double rewards to upgrade to the next “age”.   It is incredibly janky and frustrating. It used to happen once or twice out of 15 ads or so, but now it keeps showing me the ad style that causes the crash ALL THE TIME, presumably because it thinks I’m never seeing it and my rewards are not granted nearly 40-50% of the time now.   Extremly annoying. Also, There’s no way to contact the developer or explain their janky ad system isn’t working so basically the game is broken and unusable despite having a lot of long term potential; especially seeing the skill trees available that hint a a really long and rewarding experience.  Oh well, more shovelware freemium garbage for mobile phone gaming. What a surprise!"
1,TheLocale,"Ads double the value. First level is 10 going to 20. Then maybe 100 into 200, then 500 into 1,000, then 10,000 into 20,000, then millions, then tens of millions.  Always level up the rate of food, skip the middle evolution, acquire the last evolution, use it to destroy and gain coins, then dump all coins into food production, then acquire middle to help out last. Best the first part in like 3 hours of play and see absolutely no reason to go into the 2nd age and restart with 12 coins on the first level. I’m not watching that many ads, no sir.  1*. Fun, but no replay value. My daughter just liked clicking and seeing the men fall down and die. No variety, no change, no upgrades, I only got upgrade cards on the first draws they give you and never got enough gems to pull 10 more cards so that’s a busted system. 2nd age lets you kill 10!zombies for 50 gems, twice. Then watch 2 ads for more. Then you still can’t do a pull of 10 cards to upgrade. At that point all the mechanics were there and figured out and I saw no reason to continue and literally restart the grind with different skins. Uninstalled and here I am.  Play for a few hours, then delete."
4,Keaton42,"Make base game speed be faster but the ad will speed it up even more - I’m fine watching an ad for it but man I don’t want to have to wait 2 minutes for a whole uneventful round  Nerf the 3rd troop - for about every single one of them they should be costing almost double the meat and slower attack speed, they outshine the first troop.  Add like 3 bases to beat before they evolve - It’ll give some sense of progression. I enjoy games that reward you even when losing but this is just too much  Make the scaling for upgrades not get crazy expensive and the first ones extremely cheap - I’m fine watching ads but I’m not gonna watch 3 ads to increase meat production by 0.2%  Make base health upgrade give you a ton more than just 2, and perhaps start at 10 health and not 1 - Yeah the enemy has 500 and I struggle to get more than 6  Make ranged enemies have a bit more health - Come on it’s just stupid  Overall great game, it’s just some things here stop it from being more fun while still keeping the base game"
2,JordieeJ,"It’s an alright game. I didn’t progress past stage 2 because I don’t have 8 hours to progress past one stage. There’s no skill or strategy; beating stages relies on watching ads and grinding until you can buy more troops. It’s not very fun after a little while. The art style is very cool and nostalgic. Although, I think a bit more effort could have been put into making some of the troops have walking animations or something so they aren’t gliding across the screen?? Stages also do not change and are the same every single time you restart. Again, another reason why this game grows old quickly. There’s potential, but I don’t want to watch ads and grind just to watch some sprites hit each other for hours on end. Definitely needs some more love."
3,collinE26,"After having played enough to be on the 3rd timeline and played a few special events, There really isn’t much to the gameplay. It’s pretty repetitive and one timeline is really all you’d want to play through. That can probably be done in a few hours. You basically just do the same thing over and over for every evolution until you complete a timeline and then the next timeline is just the same as the previous timeline, but with different civilizations. Each evolution is just a slightly varied trio of weak melee, strong melee, weak ranged, or strong ranged. over and over and over. Fun for the first few hours, but gets old quick. And no end in sight."
2,Junee..,"At first it was a very fun game nice art and simple to understand only problem is upgrading, its super slow! spent an hour or more and i was still struggling to have the caves health down to 400. The only time I actually got somewhere was when I watched an ad for more meat, not to mention the game feels kinda empty after sometime all you can do are daily tasks/watch ads which you have to wait to watch more/and upgrade cards by doing daily tasks, sometimes you gotta wait on the tasks as well. Honestly if you’re a person who has decent amount of free time or a lot I wouldn’t bother playing this game unless you see theres been a recent update. Overall 2 stars needs more to the game if progress is gonna be really slow"
5,Elmano2,"I think this game is great, brings me back to when I was little playing games on the online, pacing is slow but fun I really hope the game is expanded upon. The one issue I’ve been running into is sometimes I’ll watch an ad for an reward after battling for more coins, but when the ad is finished playing I’m not able to close it, so I would have to quit the game and lose all of my rewards from that battle. This doesn’t happen often but it seems to happen once in a while with certain ads. Otherwise the game is great!"
5,Be derby,"It’s a fun game with a good sense of strategy, and I think the pacing is pretty fast once you get to events. This only issue I have is that there’s no price you can pay to get the ad rewards without watching the ads. I’ve played a few games that basically have a “buy in”, where you pay like $20 and can then get the ad rewards without watching. This is, essentially, choosing to ‘buy’ the game, instead of play for free with ads. Whatever the price would be, it would streamline the game experience significantly.   Thanks!"
3,Britainsux,"The game itself seems very simple. You summon little dudes to walk across the arena and beat up the AI’s dudes. Simple but fun and pretty addictive — reminds me of flash games I used to love!  Unfortunately you quickly realize the entire game is about you watching 30-45 second ads. If you want to make any reasonable progress you have to watch, no exaggeration, dozens of ads. Most games of this type offer a way to pay to disable ads and just get timed bonuses, which I would do if it was available.  I seriously want to love it and will come back if this ridiculous ad requirement is resolved but as is, I cannot recommend this game."
4,Elmora3,"This is truly a unique game. I haven’t found anything quite like it. At first, it is frustrating to lose so often, but it is an incentive to get a good strategy to earn money to level up. It has captured my attention so far, and I really enjoy that you can choose to watch ads for incentives/rewards, but ads are not shoved down your throat every 3 minutes. The only thing I would say could be different is when you evolve, there could be a bit of time before the enemy starts defeating you again, or there could be more food produced per second. Other than that, I really like this game."
4,b00sk1fire,"I play this game to pass time, it’s for when I’m checked out and want something simple. After the new update, I was given a good amount of in game currency to spend on the new card system, but even after opening every card available I am still only at around 30B in strength and my opponents are now at around 10H, making the game completely unplayable unless I: A. Spend an obscene amount of money (thousands of dollars by my estimates) to get back to a normal amount of difficulty or B. Do daily challenges for 10 years Would appreciate a fix for this, thanks!"
4,Rose Meji,"It’s really slow at the start and you get frustrated a bit, but push through a little bit more and it gets great. You feel really really accomplished when you break down the first camp house thing. It really does make you feel a bit better like all your losses and hard work actually meant something. If you want to quickly win in the beginning this game isn’t for you. And there’s actually a bit of strategy involved. You have to figure out which character(s) to throw out first for you to be successful and get the most coins! Great game really well thought out"
5,CashMoneyThompson,I’ve read a few reviews and the main complaint is it get to grindy/ takes to long to level up. You should focus on getting more cards that will make your troops more powerful! Also skills but the cards are more important. If you have to wait till tomorrow to get more green coins then wait if you don’t want to then you’re gonna have to grind. Only complaint isn’t really a complaint but the percentages of summoning level 4 add up to 100.1%. I hope the developers see this and fix it! Love the game tho thanks to the developers! Keep it up👍
3,Argonaut00,It crashes when I go to watch adds sometimes. Screen just goes blank. Wouldn’t be much of a problem except it also erases the coins you just earned and were trying to double with the add.  Edit: it has stopped crashing on ads. Yay! I would up my review except I spent $11 to get the permanent x1.5 speed up. And immediately saw that they are now offering a x2 speed up for another $11…. Does it just keep going or something? Like I was thinking of spending a bit of money on this to get coins and such but then they pull this and it just rubbed me wrong. If I had known beforehand what all the options were I wouldn’t feel so ripped off.
4,Cookie gate,"I don’t mind the ads at all, my only problem is that progression at the start of every timeline is suuuuuuper slow. We’re talking 20-30 minutes longer than every other stage, and that’s being generous. Not only is it way longer, it feels so bad to play and send out two guys then die over and over and over and over and over again until you can get the next unit. There should be some balancing around this, as it is easily the worst part of this game. If this issue is properly addressed, I will change my rating to five stars."
2,LJ111222222223,"As I played the game I have watched ads to progress in the game, I had a glitch happen which set me back in the game I had written them about the issue and they told me that their sorry but they can’t not help me, other then refund money that I may have spent on the game. So I just decided to move forward with the game, and found out on an event they had called candy land, they make it impossible to beat, even as I got the food faster it seemed like they were coming out faster, and when I froze the enemy for 1.5 seconds, the ice cream launcher had launched the cream. Some how they reloaded while frozen and was able to shoot right afterwards. Anyways, I will be uninstalling the game for the two reasons above."
3,Come on maaaan,"I can deal with the regurgitated enemies and the never-ending grind to advance. But to even have a chance of doing it in a semi-timely manor, you have to watch ad after ad after ad and THAT’S the part the makes my head hurt.   I’d be happy to pay a flat fee like most games offer to permanently do away with them. No such option here. And while they are 100% optional, it’s really a must when you need the level up or gain an advantage in how much food you have (troops you can dish out).  I’m probably gonna play for a little longer, but the most-common reason why I’ve deleted games is because of the (almost) mandatory advertisement."
5,k dog 2138,"This game is not like other games where you need to pay or watch a lot of ads to pregress furthur. To me adds are annoying and a hassle. But this game gives you the option to watch for extra credits in game which i enjoy. Its time consuming and takes all of your cares away as you get immersed into this chill game. This game is also strategic. If you use right logic you can progress faster. Things like charecter placement, upgrades(not alot so you dont get as confused) and so much more. I definitely recommend this game 👍🏽"
5,Nonamedrandomperson,It’s a pretty good game. You don’t have to spend money or watch ads unless you want to. There are fun side quest. And pretty good graphics. if you want to get this game you should know that it is all about trying to defeat the other team (bot) you have to upgrade your food creation and upgrade your health so that you can defeat them that’s about all OK bye ✨👑💅💞✨🥳 Edit: I just installed the new update and nothing really new but you can calculate like how long it’s gonna be therefore waves of different people (P.S. sorry about my bad wording) KK bye👌✨💅👑❤️🥳🌹😍🥰
2,FlightlessCupid,"Literally as the title says, pay for upgrades, watch ads till you can’t take it anymore, or you’re grinding for days. It was alright the starter evolution, less so the second evolution, and by the third state it’s impossible to win unless you’re watching countless ads to get upgrades. I refuse to mindlessly watch ads, it’s not fun. So I tried *just* grinding again. It’s been all day and still haven’t broken through the equivalent opponent forces. You get a .2 increase in resource regeneration per upgrade and when I’m max making 12-13k per round (and the rounds are pretty decent in length) while upgrades are 70k?? Too slow of progress. I have to delete the game as it’s become boring."
3,connorboy07,"I like this concept of fighting through the different eras, but there’s a few flaws.  1: it doesn’t work very well on iPad because the setup is for phones, so it glitches and buttons overlap on iPad.  2: the AI has a frustrating advantage being able to spawn massive groups of soldiers at once making it annoyingly hard to survive.  3: lots of the extra skills like cards that boost damage and the powers are uncommon, hard to get, and overpriced (very overpriced) I don’t hate everything, per say, it’s very fun and creative it would just be better if those little flaws were fixed, hopefully this will be taken into consideration."
2,Ecw33de0,"The game is fun, has a decent concept.  Could stand to have more things to upgrade than just food generation.  Major issue is there hits a difficulty wall after about 4 timelines that is impossible to overcome.  The AI gets to cheat with unit spawning and clearly isn’t following the same concept as the player.  During the final wave the computer will spawn 60+ units in 20 seconds and steam roll you.  The amount of food generation to match their unit spawn would take weeks to beat a single level.  The events are very similar, impossible to participate I suspect until you’re very late game.  If the dev team balances the difficulty scaling a bit better than it would be an easy favorite."
1,Vktb,"I was having a lot of fun playing, and I put about 12 hours into it. You don’t HAVE to spend any money or watch any ads, but it like most mobile games, watching ads does make it easier to progress.  So when I saw that there was a race event that rewarded you with premium currency based on your position in the leaderboard, I spent most of my day playing the game in order to get to fourth place.  For the race events, you’re supposed to stay inside that timeline until the end of the event, and then you’ll have a little claim reward button pop up. If you back out to the main menu/timeline, like I did, there is no way to go back and claim your reward. Essentially it was a ton of wasted time and I’m uninstalling."
5,jgr288eal,"Hi this game is a very good game but there are a few problems. One problem is that the first battle the enemy base has 500 HP and I played the game nonstop and I can’t beat the level. So I’m just saying that if you can make the HP around 25-50 HP. Also you should add something in the shop like characters for a good amount, and make the enemy’s a little bit easier to deal with. There is that like when I deal with the guy riding the dinosaur their was like 5 cavemen and 2 stone throwers and that was a little OP. SO I am just saying maybe make your game a bit easier.😁"
4,Thescarygamer,"I think this game is great. It’s simple, not over challenging, and fun. I only want to get farther and farther into the game and progress. There is just one problem. The cards and how you can obtain them. I really want to get new cards but you can only really get them by completing daily challenges or purchasing. Now I’m trying to do the daily challenges but one is I have to watch 5 ads. This wouldn’t be an issue except the ad buttons are all glitches and will not let me tap them. If there were more ways to earn the summon coins and ads weren’t glitched, this game would be perfect."
2,PfcNewkirk,"I have only been playing this game for a day. In general it is pretty entertaining to pass the time. But I read a review that said that the progression without paying for upgrades with real money is super slow. So I purchased the 7 dollar box and got some decent upgrades. At the end of each playthrough they give you the option to double your coins if you watch an ad. Pretty typical. However, once I started racking up some decent coins the option to double them was conveniently not loading. I'm not sure if there is a cap on how much you can double but this is a pointless, and foul attempt to get the player to put more money into it. Do better."
4,kushwizard42069,"I was excited to finally give an event boost a shot and for $23 i expected it to last the whole event but shortly after some playing i had to leave the game and my phone shut off, when i came back it felt off so i checked the store and it was as if id never bought it. if that information was clearly stated that it would only last for that short play session i definitely don’t think i would’ve made the purchase. i love the game but pretty disappointed that’s how they treat folks spending money on their game."
4,Jet fuel is not cheap,"This is a amazing game. I would recommend it to anyone. The only problem is that you start off really slow and it’s hard to make easy progress, but it’s also really fun and when you get to the farming age, that’s when it gets really fun because then you actually have a chance you just need to upgrade don’t delete the game if it glitches or lags the only reason is because it’s really slow to get through the first part but besides that it is a really amazing game so read this if you’re about to get this game I highly recommend it."
3,Goodyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,"It’s an alright game. Kind of a rip off of two games which I’m not going to name. It’s takes forever to actually make progress. The AI has such an advantage on the player, that AI has like 10x as much health as the player. The AI can spawn like 10 things at once and just completely overpower you out of nowhere. There should also be more ways to get the gems. The only ways you can get them are the zombie things, ads, and daily quests. Also wayyy too many ads. For an entire day the ONLY ads that I got were royal match ads. That’s all, no hate to the game or anything, just saying a few things that could use improvement."
4,dev please read very important,"Game is pretty darn fun. Sometimes feels a little repetitive, but the units are all different enough between each evolution that the game stays entertaining.  I would like to see some new cards added to the game that increase units’ attack speed and/or increase food production speed.  Also, making each level where the enemy units don’t get depleted would be good. It’s to easy to just outlast the enemy waves and then have your units attack the base. If the enemy would just keep coming, rounds would be 1) more lucrative and 2) more challenging Devs please add this!!"
3,1121987,"Starting out you have no advantage and no ability to make any troops. Initially I wondered if there was something I was doing wrong. Invest in food production and get a small incremental increase to food production, but once you hit a certain point you are able to produce the stronger and better units. Don’t buy any coins, you lose all progress when you evolve your troops, and any coins you have purchased through the store, will be erased upon evolve.  If you like to hit your head against a wall to eventually find another wall, please pick this one up. I can’t help but like a waste of time like this, best case scenario."
2,J-Wood reviews,"3 characters per age, soldier-ranged-knight. Game play consists of repeated losses and slightly longer rounds with each little upgrade until you unlock the next age and progress goes back to shorter rounds and quicker losses. A real grind lacking much depth. There are little stat bonuses you unlock for a slight increase in damage etc. but it all is averaged out and doesn’t give you an edge. The length of the game is mapped out well, the content is shallow and stretched thin. Needs at least 1-2 more character types, more skill/stat bonuses or a skill tree would be much better. You could consider paid mercenaries you could spend gold on, consumable skills, base defenses, etc. This one needs some development to stand out at all."
3,Borediphonegaymer,"It plateaus. After tier six the evolutions cost the same. And you earn exponentially coin per evolution killed. But after tier six they stay costing 10m. On tier one it was 20+ restarts before evolving to tier two. I’m not on mutants without having actually finished all waves of age of world wars. It just stops. You earn 18m after killing the cowboys and you can evolve , I’m on quantum age and haven’t actually fought against the age of world wars faction. It’s a fun game and reminds me of age of empires but it’s not finished and it’s like the devs haven’t played their own game up past the first 5 tiers. Or something was missed causing the evolution to be the same price"
4,23tdog023,"This game is free to play! It’s pretty fun too! Game doesn’t require you to be active every day to have fun! It was hard to get started but once you get to timeline 7 the game is loads of fun, we will have to see how long that lasts.    However, some ads won’t load the X in the corner to close them so I can never collect the rewards(it’s only certain ads)    events are mediocre at best and the race is pointless for any new players and should be fixed so new players can obtain gifts, even if they are small gifts 10 gems is better then 0"
3,Ares1zz,I like the game but your opponent sends the same waves every time o variation at all and can send multiple units at once I think it would be interesting if there was some variation in that past that the card system is interesting (spend $4 and you can overpower opponent with ranged unit first era food production was 7.2 i think) it would be kinda cool if we could add defensive structure like in the older games but with how this is set up I don’t think it would work I doesn’t force adds so thats a plus  EDIT you don't keep any upgrade stuff when evolving no refund on coins only thing you keep is the cards and the blue coins
5,Dr3w66,"I love this game it is simple yet progressive. You need some type of strategy using your skills and timing them correctly to be successful. I am on timeline 93 currently. I would recommend adding another featured battle for extra prizes sooner then later. Also can you move or change the word block that appears over the troops heads? When I am trying to time my recover skill by watching the life bar, sometimes “block” covers it up and messes up that timing accidentally letting my troop die.  Thank you, Drew M"
5,Yeen_Bean,"Not only is it a lot of fun. When looking at videos on free games, how I found this, they promise no adds but there are. Here though they actually honor that promise and you only need to watch adds if you want double coins and such, but it is optional.  The actual game is very fun. I’ve enjoyed playing the game as it is both simple, but has unique concepts to it which makes it stand out. They stick to what they advertise unlike many other games. It’s worth the free download. I highly recommend."
3,jared1189,"Developers, I hope your read this. This game has great potential. There needs to be some function that better rewards players for investing more time playing per day. Just giving a few daily rewards is not enough and people will lose interest quickly.   You essentially create a pay-to-play when you don’t reward gameplay and after a few days of gameplay the only way to progress is a cash payment to upgrade cards.   It would be awesome if you could let people progress more quickly without paying money for upgrades."
3,Helms to the top,"Unit spawns and movement are very different than the CPU where they can have units side by side and when they do spawn behind they smoothy glide to the side of the other units as for the players units spawn very much in a single file line and have a slow time getting around units, I found extremely frustrating as I have no control on this and am at a disadvantage due to taking double the attack while not being able to do so myself. Ads are kind of apart of most mobile games now, I understand it’s how you guys make revenue on free games but I would argue to increase the ads you can watch for gems."
3,Kuronicle,"This game is fun but i feel like the card system is bugged, because every time i draw a card it ALWAYS gives me same card. I made it to the Spartan Era, with Dino Ribs as my only card up to level 7, and it keeps drawing me that specific card, have not come across any other card other than Dino Ribs. I’ve watched videos on this game and no one seems to be having the same problem… I dont know if im missing something important about how the card system works or if my game downloaded wrong, but whole thing got me pretty bummed out..  But yeah other than that, game is alright."
3,BearChair88,"I’ve been playing for like an hour and I’ve made next to no progress. I don’t mined watching adds for free progression, but even doing that the game just isn’t worth playing. I really enjoy the game, but there’s not enough going on to justify watching so many adds, and still be so far behind. The AI really dose just walk all over for the majority of the game, beating you down over, and over again until you earn enough money to finally be stronger than it, and then…… then cycle just repeats. Hate to say it. Total waste of time. Devs are being a little to stingy. (And yes. It’s pay to win too)"
1,goobagel,"The game is so purposefully unfair that it’s obvious watching ads is the only way to make any progress in this game. Even then, progress is extremely slow. I’ve been playing for a few hours, haven’t even beaten “battle 1.” The computer is able to generate multiple troops at once while you’re stuck hopelessly waiting for the “meat counter” to rise enough for you to spawn even one troop. Also, even if you wanted to upgrade the meager counter, it upgrades by .02 meat/second, all the while the upgrades get more and more expensive. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. The more successful these blatant money milking games are, the more of them that will pop up. Just download The Battle Cats or another similar idle game. Not worth the time or frustration."
5,Commander Waffles yum,"This game is so amazing! When your done with a battle and your heading back to the main screen -expecting an add- there isn’t one because unless you purposely click on an add, there is none!!! The battles are intriguing and the AI gets harder as the round goes on. You have to make actual plans and have strategy to defeat them. 10/10 would definitely recommend more then most mobile games, it also looks just like it does in the add."
2,Dexterity_0,"Clearly a low quality remake of Age of War. It’s fine, I guess? I just got to the fourth stage and I can’t say I didn’t have fun, but it’s quite the slog. There’s less upgrades than age of war, less thought put into balance, and it’s not infinite. There’s set waves that don’t change depending on how you or the AI is doing. Also I am almost positive it’s impossible to beat this game without seeing ads. I’ve been stuck on the third stage for a while (at least a week) and I watched two ads to give me some meat to spawn more troops and I won immediately. Either way, you’ll probably enjoy your time, but I feel like there are better, more original games to play"
2,Kickass457,"The events cycle every week (there’s 4 different types excluding the race) and they repeat. So every 5th week you get to play the same event. However the store purchase gives you a boost to production for the events, but nowhere does it show that the boost is one time use only. So after purchasing one each of the events and seeing the first event again it required purchase. Sent an email to them to figure out if this is as intended or not and to ask for a refund and haven’t heard from them yet. Been about a month since that email.  The rest of the game is pretty though, I really enjoy the additional modes you unlock."
5,topher..,"This game is simple but very fun, you just have to be willing to pass the first level, which I admit isn’t very easy. This game doesn’t force any ads and the ones they do put on you (for doubling income for example) are not at all long or painful to sit through, as they’re usually fun little playable ones that might get you into other games, which let you skip around 5-10 seconds in which is amazing! Give this game a chance."
5,Hamtothemoon1.2,"In my mind, I think that this game can truly capture someone’s attention. There is always something to grow or soldiers to upgrade to fight enemies of increasing difficulty. It can be hard to achieve victory but after a bunch of leveling up can grant a person a satisfying victory. I also really enjoy the smaller details like the cool historical timeline that is featured whenever you level up your forces to a new era and level of technology. Truly an amazingly fun and entertaining game."
2,See-the-best,"I think the idea was actually really good. And the gameplay could be as well. But like every other review, the ads are the only serious way to progressing. Ads are okay. But when you have to watch them for any kind of progress. It’s kinda discouraging. Doesn’t seem like skill is a option. I got the first evolution and seen everything resets… yea, no. Not doing all that again. I deleted it.. took about 40 ads to get there. An now your wanting me to watch 80 more. N those really aren’t even dramatic numbers. It’s an ad sim. I wanted a game. Giving 2 stars because I like the idea. And I really wish the company would put gameplay first"
1,Pokechimp31,"As you progress through the evolutions, it feels like each new set of upgraded troops are just reskins but with higher base stats. You may as well just be playing the first level the whole game. Gameplay seems similar to battle cats, but food upgrades can get extremely expensive for what you’re getting out of them. The quests seemed like a nice idea to me until one of them said “watch ad (0/5.)” When watching ads is required to progress it makes the game not fun. Overall, a good concept for the game but locked behind yet another adwall that boosts your progression. (Progression stops feeling good after about 2 hours of playtime.) Please change some of this in the future."
4,Real Real chaos,"Strategy based game pretty much it has decent quests it’s fun and easy the only thing I don’t like is the quests can be pretty hard and at the start it’s hard more you play the easier it is, it doesn’t force any ads you’re can choose if you want to watch an ad but anyway It’s an awesome game almost worth 5 stars and I recommend playing it or at least trying out and giving it a chance because it’s multiple fun genres but anyways one of the last things I wanna say is thanks for reading"
5,Trisha123huruejsjwjjwj,This is a really fun game it’s not like other games like this because you have to earn money to level up your food speed. You have to defeat enemies to move on to the next age and I love how it’s not brain washing it’s a strategy game and it’s the best game I have on my phone. Some other games just have it were you just press a button and keep spawning them but that ruins the fun. So if you like to be competitive and like strategy games this game is for you a love this game I play it 24/7.
2,FingersDiff,"This game has potential, however the developers are amateurish and lack fundamental game design concepts. Simply put, the devs do not know what makes a game fun.  A game should have a grind/ hardworking phase, then the enjoyment phase where you get to see your hard work crush your enemies. Which this game lacks.  For example, you start out as a weak faction, slowly build up your food generation rate and upgrade your units to finally defeat your opponent. However, as soon as you put all your hard work, barely beating out your opponent, the whole game resets!! You’re left to grind all over again.   It feels like the game lacks a enjoyment buffer period so you’re left with an endless grind with little reward. One time I was so upset I decided to stay in the same timeline just so I can enjoy crushing my enemies with all my upgrades for a game or two.   Once you jump to the next timeline it’s literally just the same thing but enemy with a 1.2x modifier!"
5,its me again :),I love this game but I think it should have a free play (I just joined this game so Idk if there’s already a free play mode or sandbox mode but if not then just asking if they can add one) but anyways this game should have a free play or a sandbox mode because sometimes I wanna see what happens if I spawn a 100 warriors or bows cause I really wanna see it and not wait for hours for meat so just suggesting to add a sandbox of something. If you read all of this wow cause I don’t think I ever typed this long before so yeah…
1,Devexity,"This game is all about being weaker than the AI.  You spend hours repeating the same level over and over and watching ads to gain “minor increases” to eventually maybe overpower the AI.   There is 0 enjoyment in this game, and dopamine hits are few and far between.  Even the special modes that unlock get gated quickly as you just arent strong enough to beat the battles.    If you whale heavy, maybe you can progress.  But what’s the point?  0 pvp, 0 competitive modes, and its just the same ol same ol every “advancement”.  The levels don’t change (scenery is all), and the mob types are all similar.  Absolutely 0 innovation or thought.  Game was built by the most uncreative developer on the planet."
1,Taynkbot,"The game is almost fun! A little repetitive but then you unlock a new feature called Cards!  Cards give you a buff, like more health, which means that your club guy will survive vs their club guy in one-on-one.  But then you ascend and the enemy gets the same buffs. So there doesn’t seem to be any progression. You basically have to work as hard as you can to stay in the same place because of how it scales.  You also always feel like the underdog. You can’t really win a battle until you evolve to the age beyond the enemy.   It’s extremely frustrating to feel that every upgrade and thing you can do has been accounted for by the devs, and with a few clicks in a few seconds, they ramp the difficulty so much it takes you days to get anywhere.   I’m also annoyed that I wrote a review a moment ago but it was deleted or spontaneously disintegrated.   What could have been fun has left me fuming and I wouldn’t recommend it even though it’s close to being a real game.  Hopefully the devs rethink the mechanic that makes the game a treadmill."
3,Zacb86,Been playing for a month or two and its fun to stop really quick and play a few rounds but it is incredibly grindy and a lot of repeat enemies. I enjoy that there is variety and the challenges can be fun but I know at the beginning stages with low level abilities you will never get past them. Definitely need to update so it feels more rewarding. I enjoy that theres only the option to watch ads to help progress and they arent forced in our faces but it just makes simple progression annoying and $11 for 1.5x speed and then $11 EXTRA dollars for 2x is a sad joke.
4,Tommorelloman212,"This would be a 5 star review, but there’s one thing that gets me so mad at this game. Let’s say you have a couple soldiers shooting the enemy’s base. Then some new enemies spawn in. My soldiers cannot hit the enemies at all because the enemies are apparently shielded behind their own base… this is infuriating, because I could have 10 guys shooting the base, and then along comes like 2 enemies that I can’t hit and they just take out my whole side without them getting a scratch. Can you please fix this?"
3,ithewilde,"FYI German based company. If you enjoy the routine of redundant mind numbing play this may be the game for you.  Graphics and characters are cute as well as the simplicity of the game. But this game is not for me as play and advancement is slow (played free). Ads between every battle to double your “money” and to increase “food” by 1.5x. Still, competition is stiff and advancement is very slow.  A few hours of play over two days was enough for me. I made it to through timeline 2. Do you check the developer website before you download? You are sharing your information."
2,Sienndif321,"Game is a clear clone of a flash game called Age of War. But the graphics look nice on the phone.  Computer opponent deploys the same troops each battle, so once you get the strategy right it’s just resolving the game over and over until you have the bare minimum of upgrade to progress. I bought 5$ worth of cards and still progressed nowhere.  For developer: Wasn’t clear I would lose my coins when evolving, so there goes all the time I spent grinding in preparation. The exponential coin cost to increase food production leaves no room to try and experiment with staying behind an age to have a small advantage."
5,Dewey486,"I just love this game! All the different upgrades and evolutions you can have, it’s great! The only issue I’ve had with this game is the really slow start to the game. Once you start or get into another timeline, it gets very grindy just to beat the first level. Other than that, this game is very fun and is good if you have a bit of free time. (Also ads are minimal and you get to choose when you want to watch them.)"
2,JasonTheK1d,"Designed to make you do the same things over and over again so you’ll watch ads, this game is still a bit addictive. The gameplay is identical between boards / levels, only the graphics change. Resetting everything between levels is annoying, it doesn’t allow you to capitalize on your progress or efficiency with food. If I’m able to finish a board with food leftover, shouldn’t I be able to take it to the next level? I’m probably done with this game, unless they make some improvements to move it beyond an ad generator."
5,dnbdudndidncicn,"I think my standards are very low after the games I’ve played lol. But this game is BOMBARDED with ads like every game now, if you want extra benefits… a quick ad will do. Also very simple game, not hard at all, easy to level up. I would love to have troops from other ages still be in the inventory even after the fact I modernize my them. Other than that it’s not a game that makes you rage. Super fun simple amazing game 👍  DEVS PLEASE KEEP THIS GAME HOW IT IS🙏DONT START ADDING ADS AFTER EVERY ROUND OR CLICK, LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME NOWADAYS"
2,DV player,"With no options to make the battles faster, this game takes impossibly long to progress. You’ll be stuck in the first age watching every ad possible to afford 1-2 upgrades after a round. After playing for a couple hours I’ve been stuck in the same age and refuse to ‘wait’ for this game to progress. What happened to good games with instant gratification and enjoyment? Nowadays every single app is built around generating the most ad revenue possible and it drains the fun.  At its roots this game looked like it could be very fun. But I’m tired of these cheap apps hate keeping their good gameplay behind in-game currency and ads."
2,Daniel Daye,"While the game at its core is a fun distraction, progression is glacially slow without watching ads. Currently, enemies scale too fast, and resorce generation scales too slowly, so you’ll end up replaying the same level multiple times with no progress unless watching ads for double resource drops.  While I’m fine with this aspect, requiring watching ads for the daily quests puts a bad taste in my mouth. The 5 quests only provide enough gems for 2 cards which make next to no difference in power, and requiring that you watch 2-3 minutes of ads for that does not seem like an equivalent trade, at all."
4,Not awesome peps,I give this a four stars because it isn't forcing me to watch ads every 5 seconds but instead actually gives me the CHOICE to watch them for benefits. I’m also having fun playing it as well so it makes me want to keep this game instead of deleting it 5 minutes after download. But what keeps this from getting a better score is the fact that it gets super grindy when you have to move up to a new age.
1,Raiderade,"Maybe the worst customer service I’ve seen in a mobile game. The main game  runs fine but I found the events to be a bit glitchy. I would get kicked out of the event (not the whole app) but just the event back to the main game screen, and often it would be right when I was about to clear a level. I reached out to Lessmore for support and it as my fault and my internet or my phone with no attempt to address the issue in their end. The glitch felt like an attempt to intentional frustrate gamers into watching more ads and spending money. This game is trash, don’t waste your time, definitely don’t waste your money."
5,Luche2010,I absolutely love this game. I got it because I was bored and it immediately  Got me so excited. This game is so fun. It is kinda annoying at first with AI being fully maxed out. But it is fun to try at beat  them. I love this game and I think the graphics are so cute. And advancing on the time line is super cool. It helps give you something to work towards. You could have a tactic or just mindlessly playing. I 100% recommend this for everyone!
1,Xqc fan,"The ads leave you to believe that you get “food” really quickly when in fact you don’t, you’d have to watch an ad to get MORE food and then you’d still lose. How the upgrades work is the “food/ per sec” And “Base Health” when you upgrade your fps (food per sec) from your staggering 0.20 fps, you get 0.22 fps. Thats right, A .02 UPGRADE! And did I forget to mention that your base is one shot, and it only goes up one health per upgrade for example “ 2 to 3” And I found once I got to about 0.42 fps, you can really only upgrade once per game which defeats the whole purpose. This game is just a waste of everyones time. So I strongly advise you dont download this game."
2,FrozenJoe21,"It is very fun and addicting at times, but oh so very annoying in between. For starters, the game punishes you in every way possible when you advance, or win through great strategy.   If you get powerful and try to win one level ahead, you end up wasting your own time, and the game resets your progress back to the start. You will spend nearly all of your time in the slowest, entry level, battle - regardless of how powerful your units are.   You can watch ads and immediately lose the benefits they provide. Example, you can win a match and watch an ad to double your winnings, only for the game to rest your progress and erase your winnings before you can play the next match.   The level you gain the most, is the end just before a reset, eliminating all the gains.   Idk, I wouldn’t waste my money on this game ever, and I am sick and tired of seeing the ads. Probably best to pass on this game or only enjoy the first 10 hours or so."
4,OverlyDefensiveShrek,"The game itself is amazing don’t get me wrong. There are a few things that can be improved. First, the game starts of very slow. The player must go through many attempts before being able to purchase the Dino unit which is the turning point in the game. Secondly, the game has some screen loading bugs. For example, once the setting button is clicked, the closing button is much much smaller, making is less visible to see."
1,Malvalen,"I’m convinced this game is just an ad farm. I played for an embarrassingly long time before forcing myself to uninstall because I knew from even early on that this wasn’t really a game. You can win each level over time by grinding gold and increasing food production speed until you have enough to send out bunches of the strongest troops to overpower the enemy team, no actual strategy needed. Granted, I was fine with that because I just wanted a mindless grind, but when everything is asking me to watch ads and I have no way of disabling them with a one time purchase, that plus the exceedingly simple gameplay make it obvious what this product is trying to do."
1,Stycotic,"Decent graphics, scam money grabber. Everything is designed around money. It’s excruciatingly difficult to actually reach the fun stage with spells but once you do it becomes more annoying to progress and don't get me started on the events. Everything is designed to make you watch ads. Even what most games give you for free everyday. There is literally a daily bonus to watch ads which is pathetic. What’s worse is there is mo option to just avoid ads and have fun so most of the time progression is painful and slow. Do not recommend if you value your time. I think we should not allow such malicious content to remain so highly rated."
5,My thoughts on this app…,"This is my favorite app on my phone. Once you start playing you can’t stop. This app is so addicting, I bet I could play for 6 hours straight! (Considering my phone doesn’t die.) a lot of people say this app is ad reliant. DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!! They just don’t want you to have this amazing app. Besides, you don’t NEED to watch ads. That’s only if you want to get extra coins. Plus that’s YOUR choice. Like I said, download this app now, and DONT, miss out. Or you’ll be sorry."
3,Skilledgamer070,"i LOVE the idea of this game and can imagine myself playing this 24/7, but the progression is just insufferably slow and painful. The upgrades barely change anything, yet get exponentially expensive, the cards you buy with 100 gems also do next to nothing and you only get 400 gems/day. i also with there was at least some sort of an idle aspect which would definitely help the game. other than that if you like games where you spend a month playing and don’t get anywhere, then this game is for you."
1,DarthZidon,"Don’t listen to all the reviews that say it’s a great game. In the beginning you have low resource production so it’s impossible to win. You start off with a 2 Hp base while the enemy gets a 500 hp and can spawn hoards of enemies. The rewards per match are meager, so it’s rough.  All you do is loose, loose, and loose. Untill you can beat the level. I haven’t even made it passed level one. And I’ve been playing it for atleast 1hr 30 mins or so. The only way to win is through high resource production and you can’t achieve that with loads of time spent on the game or watching adds to speed it up to double resources. This game is just a cheap cash grab. Screw this."
1,bruhsmh2,"I saw an ad for this game, it looked promising so I gave it a shot. Played for a couple hours,  and spent most of my time watching ads to get any sort of progress in this game. Progression is way too slow for the amount of time needed to put into it and AI will have a constant spawning advantage for 90% of the game. Imagine being a level 1 character vs somebody who has spawning hacks for most of the game. Ads aren’t forced but you’ll end up wasting even more time if they aren’t watched. Unless a balance update is implemented, this game isn’t worth progressing and you shouldn’t even bother trying to get to a decent level. Shameless ad-driven game. 1 star."
5,Jacktheonly,"Ok, so a lot of the reviews say that there are so many ads, but there aren’t actually any required ads. Sure you can watch an ad to get free stuff, but you can easily get that stuff without ads and simply by just playing the game. It is easy to progress and not to easy and not too hard. You will never be stuck in this game, I promise you. This is the only app I have opened on my phone since I got it. Happy gaming!"
5,Nickers lives don’t matter,"I love this game it’s really fun. The best thing about it has got to be that ads are completely optional, most games, shove ads in your face and force you to watch them just to play the game but you don’t have to watch ads if you don’t want to for this game if you want your coins or something like that, you can watch an ad but if you don’t feel like watching the ad, you don’t have to amazing"
1,hundredband,"Pretty much gives you the option to watch ads every 30 seconds or pay for the non ad version. They are begging for money. The problem is its a very  repetitive  game. After playing it for around 10 hours, id say there are no visual differences from the very first hour to the tenth hour played. It was fun the first hour but i had a feeling it would be a repetitive game. Why did i play 10 hours of it then? Well i was hoping for something amazing from the game. Now i have to spend money to upgrade abilities or ill spend all day trying to pass a few levels.   To sum it up:   Don't play it if your not planning on spending a pretty penny on it."
5,UNBAND ME!,I played this in my car over a long distance drive about 3 hours and it felt like 30 mins playing this this game has legit nothing bad to it no ads UNLESS you want to watch ads to get rewards and such and I love the art style and goal of the game if I would be able to give this a rate better than 5 I would! I really recommend and enjoy this game and I hope more people come across this game. The devs deserve an award
2,Cody801,"I just don’t get it. It’s taking me FOREVER to level up enough to beat the first level. No matter how many upgrades and characters I put down, it’s not enough and I eventually get destroyed over and over and over again. I can’t just sit here and do the same thing all night long. I must be missing something because I am the only person on the planet that feels this way, but either way I will be deleting it now and going back to Rush Royale where I belong. I only downloaded this game because on Rush Royale I see the ad for this all the time so I figured I would try it. Bad idea."
5,piggy🐖🐖123,"Amazing game! So cute and honestly I only downloaded it because the icon was cute. But it doesn’t disappoint. So far, and I’ve only played for two days, there’s no obligatory ads. Only ads to double your score or for power ups. And the ads they show aren’t the typical ads, but actually ads for games I haven’t seen before. I think the game is fairly balanced and is overall a good game. No complaints."
4,IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-,"This game is a good game if u wanna spend ur free time grinding, it really is just the same for the whole time. Its addicting to me but idk for other people, you start playing but the enemy is over powered way more than you always, its really hard to get a victory but when u age up from the stone age to the medieval age its a big difference but not when they also level up after one round right after u level up. Its a good game but in general its 4 stars, Grinding game, and js not rlly fair in general."
3,Kf chicken,"The ai doesn’t have to worry about processing food bc they ai and they beat us too much because they have more XP and you guys are controlling them and so it makes it hard to win the fact that you have to pay 2k to evolve like that is too much money there’s a lot of ads in the game  the ai are way faster than us, and it just gets on my nerves. They keep spotting too much dinosaurs too.    Update: the ai I still powerful and I’m not feeling it. I’m getting ready to delete this game. if I can give you a half a star I would"
4,Ryan_B_N,Love the game. It’s simple and fun. My one qualm is that when you are trying to send out multiple units they get locked in one straight line and run into each other. It’s obviously not impossible to play as I’m on timeline 5 now but boy is it annoying that enemies come out 5 wide and I’m forced into one straight line where they just all get picked off one by one by range because all 6 of my units are in line line marching to death. At least let us go 2 wide
5,Tman123137,"Finally a game where you do not have to wait days to progress. I enjoy that the only way to move along in the game is to actually play. There is still a need for strategy which adds to the progression. This game is really similar to the old flash game Age of War. I also like how ads are optional, it shows an appreciation for the players time. If you are willing to put in a little bit of time the game is definitely worth it"
5,The reaper of cookies,There’s plenty of content and it’s easy to progress. You can buy a certain currency to help with progression but it’s not at all needed. You can get everything you need to progress just by playing the game. You can watch ads to help with everything but you don’t have to and they’re not forced in the slightest. If you ever played Age of War its kind of like that but a lot better.
5,Deadmeat2be,"Very addictive. Nice events are that a bit pay to win however you can still get good levels out of it. Later in the game you unlock a special swordsman I’d love to see the added dungeon for heros where to take on multiple battles and then fight a dungeon boss “new hero”. Be awesome to have some rarity options and different heros we may not have seen in game (ninja, mad scientist, notable characters from other games from the developer)"
5,-\(:/),"It is a very nice game and it’s completely free! Simple graphics, their ads aren’t goofy and are basically what the game looks like. But in the start it takes a long time to get to the farm age. One suggestion is to allow players to go back to other ages and timelines. Maybe add a multiplayer mode(single device) so you can battle with your friends, and make sure the players can only choose the timelines and ages they unlocked."
4,FaZe beach,"It’s no secret that ads drive the game progression, and I’m fine with this because the ads are optional. However, I have a problem with the ads cutting out game audio. After closing out certain ads upon receiving my reward, the game audio is no longer existent until I close the app and reload the game again. Not too annoying, but it would be nice to fix this.  Also, if the permanent 2x speed wasn’t $11, and around $5-$6, then I’d purchase it."
5,Doger_DogeKing,"At the beginning you got to grind and like purchase the right amount of stuff and make the most out of coins. First day for 1 hour of playing I was I have won! How I got the game is through the ads and finally it doesn’t lie! All you got to do tho it’s not to buy anything with your real life money and that’s it, not a lot of ads because you can choose them and yeah. Would recommend"
3,~~Idle,"I have reached Timeline 153 and it is addictive and fun to play. However, the most recent update getting rid of watching ad to speed up to 1.5 really ruin my desire to play the game. You have to pay $11 to get Game Speed Forever. When it is optional to spend money, but the current speed of the game is extremely slow and boring. I wish the function of watching ad to get Game Speed is back. I give 3 stars because it is really entertaining and kill my time for a time period."
4,T-Baby1978,"Enjoyable game, but it is immediately noticeable that progression is laborious and time consuming. Meaningful progression time feels like it requires ads, or else you’re playing double the battles to make up for it.  May suggest higher coin drop rates, or a higher initial base hp.  However, I should say that I plan to continue the game as I enjoy the nostalgia of this game type. However, I might not stay on this platform if every stage requires so many battles to unlock the next component."
4,Refwen,"I’ve been playing for a few months now after seeing an ad for it. Tis fun and poses a challenge. However, after one of the last updates I haven’t seen the daily challenges or new keys for the “zombie dungeon”. I wrote this off as being timed to where I need to check back after I did these the previous day. But alas, not the case. I restarted my phone and same thing. I’m sure this is just a bug in the app."
1,calebmorgan98,"Progression is insanely slow and not worth anyone’s time. Takes way to long to earn money for upgrades, and the upgrades themselves are pretty insignificant for their prices. Your base health literally doesn’t matter if your squad is upgraded enough to keep the enemies away from it so that’s a pointless upgrade. Should just start out with the same health as the enemy. You have to lose a lot of rounds before you can get any upgrades then you have to watch ads to double your money otherwise you’d be on the game forever. Not worth it, not even if you had the time. Glorified Ad watching machine."
5,Rickyv28,"I don’t usually write reviews but I HAD to tell whoever takes the time to read this. I was surprised that it could be this fun and on top of that they don’t ask you buy something every 5 minutes or 5 to 10 times when you first open the app, so annoying but not this game. I just would like to take the time to thank the developers for an awesome game!!!"
2,DownwithRH,Game had me hooked and I was excited about it so I bought the 2x coin boost in the beginning. It only got me to about the 5th time jump before the game became extremely repetitive. No progress unless you play the same level OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER bating you to either watch ads for extra coins or purchase packs to make it easier to earn them. Or cards to increase your soldiers atk strength. I get it. You gotta make money. But I almost don’t want to play anymore because you make it not fun to play because you’re greed for as clicks and micro transactions. Boring.
4,Kiley Baldys,I love this game I don’t really mind ads but if you do this game might not be for you. You have to watch ads to get the coins you need to become stronger. The only problem is that in the first timeline the 6th battle is too hard I can’t pass it 😭😭😭😭 The graphics are great. I love the tiny people but I just can’t pass the 6th battle.  I recommend this game but don’t go through it too quickly take your time to pass the stages.
4,Dj Sweatshirt,"Game is good, fun and very easy to focus on, not too complicated.  I will say the new pause button doesn’t work at the time I’m writing this, but I’m sure it will get fixed to actually pause the game instead of asking to quit the game. I think the game doesn’t have anything to really improve on as it isn’t too hard to level up and stuff, only think I’d like is to see more daily challenges maybe? Or less time between challenges."
5,Fjejcs,"I think this is the type of game I’ve been looking for. Very tappy, strategy but simple game. Plus there’s no ads, unless you wanna double earnings or get more of the second currency to buy these upgrades. The ads being shown is completely up to you and doesn’t get shoved in your face every two minutes. Plus the game looks great. I’m just worried about when I’ll finish it cause I love this game."
5,Your dads account,Good fun. Not slammed with adds every five minute. Good animations. Only one part of the game is hard and thats the very start and when you do the time warp. Even then it only takes 20-30 mins to do. If you have time and enjoy being able to watch a video while playing a game this ones for you. You dont have to pay attention constantly and you can still have fun with it.
5,Pokémon_addict,This is a great game and I’m on timeline 2 and it’s very fun I liked to bully the Stone Age people with my modern tanks but this does have more then average ads but it dosent bother me since I only get ads when say o clock on 2x gold good job! Ideas:I think u could make a friends system say you could trade your thingies(the robot or Shakespeare)I would love that I had crappy expectations that weren’t true
2,DavidKkz,"It feels like the game was created specifically to show ads. To make almost any progress you must watch ads. Or else it takes hours getting anywhere only to reset once you “level up” or go to the next army where you have to start from scratch… and rewatch all the ads getting back to the same point.  After increasing meat production so much and having it reset on the next set of units… and ending up doing worse… I knew the game wasn’t for me. I don’t need a game to watch ads.  If it were more balanced, I can see the game being decent."
2,Ha1lan,"After playing this game for about a day or two you begin to realize how repetitive this game can get. After you rebirth and get new units but they’re basically the same unit with re-textured skins. There’s no unique unit, it’s always going to be a melee, ranged, and heavy unit. Unless there’s another unique unit later on you should not have to grind this much to get to the other unique units. Additionally, every level is pretty much the same with little variations. This feels like more of a ad-simulator than a strategy game because progressing in this game takes forever."
5,genBcapp,"Really fun game, very relaxing and well made. It takes a bit to really get into, but later in the game, it becomes really fun. The only problem I’ve had is for a few days my dungeons haven’t reset there keys, but I’m sure this problem will be fixed in the future (developers, if you have advice to fix this it would be greatly appreciated). But other than that, really great game."
5,anonymous 3647388(&&&,Best game for long rides plane rides just anything no Wi-Fi needed I mean I couldn’t think of a better Wi-Fi game watching your Warriors. I’m in the room level right now and the archers are insane it’s just a game all around. Recommend downloading recommended for kids. It’s not gruesome at all no blood it’s kind of a strategy game it’s like a fun game. and I do not work for the company. This is like a review from a random person.  -Anonymous  -
3,Alex's Store,"I used to love the flash game Age of War on the pc that was just like this, upgrading units and fortresses, etc. while your opponent does the same.   This game is exactly like that, but with few upgrades and units to purchase. The only way to beat the battles is to accumulate enough money from each attempted battle to upgrade some aspect of your limited loadout, and eventually evolve to the next era.   The annoying part is that the hold generation is slow, and winning takes a LONG time - unless you watch ads to double your income from each battle. Every time I play now I find myself almost always watching an ad after every battle.   TLDR; At its core, it’s fun. I wish there were more upgrades and difficulty settings for the opponents. The ads are necessary to advance, which make them a common occurrence."
1,elit3keraed,Everyone giving us a five star review. Must be playing a different game. It is absurd how much you have to grind just to progress. You start with one health on your cave while your opponent has 500 and the cost to upgrade by one HP each level increases exponentially. Like a few coins to go up to two then 30 coins to go up to three etc. etc. and when you evolve for 2000 coins you restart. Sowith an average earning per round without watching ads being about 80 coins you’re gonna play a few hundred rounds before you even close to being able to beat the computer
5,Jackson da third,It’s not an add farm it’s the best and it’s so addicting I was playing a game that had a lot of adds I watched an add about this and I got the game and was happy with my choice it’s the best a lot of people are saying in this that it’s an add farm that’s not true you chose if you watch the add idk why you are saying that’s it’s slow you have to upgrade your thing and if you agree then write a review and link mine
4,Gelo Elka,"This game is very good. I can put long hours into playing leveling up. The only bad thing about it is it is very slow paste you can take you hours to beat the first level because the characters are so weak at first so you may need to watch a couple ads to get more food for your character, but despite all of that this game is very addictive. Very fun concept I would recommend."
5,0mnicrex,"Very cute game. I’m still in the early stages and progressing is slow, when you first open for the day there are four ads offered for a pile of food, this usually jumps progress a little further each time.   Ads are unobtrusive and I’m not forced to watch one if I decline doubling the end round prize. Not for those who get frustrated with Grinding and Waiting games.    All said this adorable game is refreshing in a sea of ad heavy FTP. It’s also a simple and casual game. What you see is what it gives you. I hope it doesn’t end up bogged down with extra bells and whistles like other simple basic games tend to have happen.    I’m headed into the Spartan Era after this review! 10/10 Devs, thanks for sharing your work with us."
3,Wakeup1618,"I like that I can watch ads when I want for in-game benefits and they’re not forced on you. However, very often (maybe 1/3 of the time) when I watch an ad, as soon as it’s over and I should get credit for watching, the ad/game freezes. No credit for watching, and the only way to get out of it is to close and restart the game. It’s frustrating and makes me not want to watch, which is translating to me playing the game less.  Otherwise the game is decent."
4,3rd gen iPod user,Being able to pay a small amount to get rid of ads but still able to get the benefits from them would make this a much more enjoyable game. The beginning is much too slow even with the assistance of ads. Without a competitive feature I dont see why they cant fix this and make the overall experience better by speeding things up by at least 2x on resources.
4,Camtdm13,"All aspects of this game was executed very well except for the food progression. It increases SO slow. Don’t change it as it encourages players to keep playing, but add a feature where you can spend coins to upgrade the amount of food you get per whatever. Such as like using coins to go from 1 food per second to 2 food per second. Does that make sense? Well, that’s kinda all I have to say. In conclusion, good execution, 1 request."
5,sideswipeandrlp1,"This game doesn’t force ads on you doesn’t try to make u but something every time u lose/win what I like the most is that it punishes you if u buy something I didn’t buy something but I saw a review that said he/her got punished for buying something,that’s pretty cool considering they actually want you to have fun and not pay for everything you do on the game"
5,Carsen200,The one thing we need is a small offline/idle  reward to help someone maybe stuck when they get a new timeline or just started the game and rage quit because it was hard to get money( I almost did) so the main reason of this might also get some people to log on the game more often instead of forgetting it exist and gets deleted
3,Player raider,It is boring mostly but you can be at a high-level and go to the low levels and kind of play around but it takes a long time to go to a different timeline. It’s mostly time-consuming. It’s kinda good for car rides. I mostly don’t like how the AI always has the upper hand. you have to watch an ad for everything double this double cards double money I like that it doesn’t force you to watch them but it’s like without watching the ads you can’t be good at the game. :)
2,iProxicide,"Once you start. You will lose so many times just to gather coins and see some ads, I think is not fair for how strong and the respawn amount of the enemy, while you star at like 3 HP while they have 500HP. And once you upgrade to new age you will win that fight but the next battle you will meet with the enemy with new age as you so this will fall back into you losing because again there HP is greater than yours and they spawn so many at a time so it’s basically your back to 0 in my opinion.  Game is great but they need to tweak and add more things to get gold."
1,CharIie A,"The entire game is a dumbed down version of Age of War. There are only three troops which are identical in every “era” the only difference is cosmetic. There are no turrets or era abilities. The gameplay is unbearably slow unless you watch an ad for “1.5x” speed, which is actually normal speed. The default speed feels like slow motion. You don’t advance in the game by being good, it’s just a matter of farming coins so you can upgrade how fast you send out new units. The developers clearly don’t care about anything except ad revenue. Anyone with their name attached to this glorified billboard should be ashamed."
5,Scrumptious vin,Her is why I think this game is a 5 star. One it is so relaxing and it never makes you want to rage. Two it’s a really fun game to play with your friends and family to compete in. Three it’s a fun game to race your friends and family in to see who can make the best team. Thanks for making this game and I will be playing it a lot thanks for making have a good day and night SCRUMTIOIS.
5,12234566789900,"I have a question for the developer.  Is there a way to go back to previous timelines? If not can you make it possible to do so? I was pretty upset because I didn’t know you lose everything (money, upgrades, etc) when going to a new timeline and the previously timeline is just gone.  Please make it possible to go back to previous timelines.  Thanks."
3,KDM drouzy,"The game is fun and runs smoothly. However, it is very repetitive as there are only three troops each level. This consist of a warrior, ranged, and a tank. Technically each level is different, but they are just the old one recycled with new skins. The game is grindy but that’s what makes it fun to play. If it is too much you can watch an ad, which almost feels necessary. Without watching any ads it would take hours to get new content. Based on the ads I see of this game, this is what I expected. 👍"
5,Lemon-Pumpkin,"the game isn't absolutely exceptional, it definitely stalls a bit at times possibly to drive ad views and purchases but it's definitely worth it, the ads are short and the fact it isn't forced means they aren't infuriating and you can definitely get through the game without watching ads if you really hate them"
1,Serial_Gooner,Way too much grinding to still get nowhere in this game. The opponent has too many advantages. They can send out a massive amount of soldiers compared to what you’re able to slowly produce. The gold you get each round is not anywhere close to the cost of a .02 per second increase in food production (food is what you need to produce a new solider). And that’s including doubling the gold amount by watching an add. It really is just a complete waste of time. It just get so not fun very quickly. Do yourself a favor and just pass this one up. I’ll be deleting this as soon as I finish this review.
5,Im Klicz,"But they don’t pop up every 5 secs, if you wanna watch them to get a head start then you can, they aren’t obnoxious like other game, bc you get a choice, anyone crying and one staring this game either don’t like how slow it is or cry about how you can get stuff by watching ads, but that’s how they get money, props to them for not have pop up adds"
5,banceforr,I usually don’t right reviews but this game is just too notch. But the only thing I don’t like about it is that you can’t go back a time line. Like what if you could go back a timeline and it’s the same as you left it and then you can go back to the current time line and it’s the same as it was. Because I wanna use different units for some fights. But great game overall.
2,The Roblox report,"So basically, I really really like the game but the thing is the enemy literally has infinite food like one time when I was using the dino, they sent out 20 troops I even counted and they easily defeated the others out and my dino since I had literally an army and they were just wiped out I was super angry and I am still angry about that. Maybe in the future if you don’t allow them to do this, I will give you a better star review because this is just not right.                                                                 Thank you for reading this."
1,coolerzanu,"Really slow, lots of ads, was fun at the start but became old and way too unfair during the following timelines. Also the green gem collection seems useless and the cards barely give any good buffs. Furthermore everything is locked behind timelines which makes the game very boring as it takes forever to get past each time. Please fix your game as it is currently awful. Way too unfair for the player. Also the probability to gain rate cards are near obsolete. Like what in the world were you as devs thinking. Was super promising but I can’t force myself anymore to play this game."
1,conartist54,"Ads aren’t crazy, but there’s daily quests to watch ads? Okay. Secondly basically a rip off of stick war and age of war. Except worse. You’re constantly losing bc your base has no health, and it takes forever to get enough “food” to train. You gotta just lose a whole bunch of times to come up with enough coins to upgrade and eventually win to move on to the next level. Just boring to lose lose lose lose. To upgrade some, get closer to winning, to lose a lot more times finally upgrade enough and win, then do it all over again."
4,Bobby Jimmy Timmy,Really big Age of War vibes. Love the progression and the variety in civilizations. However I think maybe as you progress instead of resetting the generation speed maybe make it so larger armies and more tactics are involved. I don’t like saving up my coins to invest into generation speed and just when we’re actually able to build solid forces you go back to the beginning. I think that’s a solid direction to pursue
5,Mr mudjug420,Hi there. I’m really in joying your game it’s really fun I even have watched a couple ads and I  have noticed that whenever I watch an ad the sound of the game stops working so I have to fully shut off the game a restart it if I want the sound back on and so I just wanted to let you know that there is a sound bug every time you play an ad
4,Rbong11,I enjoy this game the only thing is I wish I got more out of watching adds since i opt to watch them every time. maybe make a bonus for watching 4 in a row be like x4 or watching 10 adds in a row be like 5x the points. Also more variety of adds I see the same add like 20 times every time I play. Other than that this game is a great way to pass time and I’m more and more intrigued to keep going.
1,leftnao,"If you’re not watching ads you’re not playing game right. It’s a 3 day trial demo before it becomes unbearably boring unless you pay money cause it’s so hard. The game is pressing a button. Like ok fine, some people don’t want to play 600 apm game and want something chill. But this… looks like a project someone made in first year in uni as a side project and they said, let’s just slap ads every where we can on a 1:1 ratio where you play as much as you watch ads. If not it’s terribly grindy.  Conclusion: pay to win, 3 day ‘demo’ before u get sick of being so weak and delete app. Or watch ads/pay.  0*"
5,Mr.Olguin,"Ok well maybe it’s more of a better than others but not not necessarily my favorite, it’s the one I’ve been playing for hours at a time but I’ll find something else soon. This one is still however a lot of fun. I guess my only complaint is that the progression is rather slow even when you watch ads some times"
2,kublr112,"Game design is fantastic and I love the concept. Only issue is theirs too little. Watch ads to speed up gameplay, watch ads to double coins received( you will do it to upgrade .2 food production) only a single card I have upgraded. Have not received any other cards. Needs to add an idle mode that can help with coin production while off the app. Also needs to reduce costs for production and health, and more items to upgrade. It becomes too repetitive too quickly and that alone with make a bunch of users delete the game."
2,Baxman53,I left the game for a couple of months due to work. I finally get some time off and I discover the 1.5 game speed for 5 minutes is gone with an add watch. Please bring that back! I’m sorry but $11 is way too much for a faster game speed. Cut that price in half and then we’ll talk. The game was really good but for me that speed feature was one of the things that really helped the game. Easily a 4 star game if you bring that back. 5 stars if you reduce the adds and make that a free feature in the game
5,Bean13gone,The basic concept of the game is to try to overwhelm the opponents forces in any way possible as you make your way from Stone Age cavemen up but with ZERO forced ads it makes the game stand out from many of the other games that are out nowadays I find it hard to put down sometimes just because of the sheer lack of ads. I GIVE IT A FIVE OUTA FIVE FOR THAT ALONE!!!
3,Wolf8Fish,"It a fun game but watching the ad sometimes allow you to be stuck in the ad which will force you to full restart the game and lose your time or progress it annoying to deal with when you just got a lot money from the battle then you decide to do the ad for the two times money then you find that you’re stuck in the ad and you can’t exit out of it then your force to restart the game, lose progress and your time"
3,Dudeof,"We are warriors offers no mandated ads as  a trade off for bad game mechanics. The games players can do things to can’t. The games players can attack you in your spawn while you can’t attack them in their spawn. Their characters spawn at th same time and have “coordinated” attacked while yours spawn as fast as you can tap giving you a BIG disadvantage. The in game cash to advantage rate is low. Overall as a strategy player  I would have excepted more but, this game severely underplays the strategy play style…"
3,Hercules8711,"This game is simple and I’ll admit, kind of addictive. However, this game starts off so slow and unless you want to disregard the double rewards, it is can be ad free. It requires so many points to upgrade your respawn rate at a minute percentage at a time. I’m talking a 1/100th percent at a time. Knowing this, ads are required to kind of speed things up. It’s still very slow to get started though.  I think 3 stars is fair enough a mediocre rating for a mediocre game."
1,WazyBabyy,"You lose every single battle because the game doesn’t give you what you need to keep up with the computer. No matter how many ads you watch, you’ll always be behind. I played for an hour and the most damage I did to the enemy base was about 50 damage out of 500 after I watched an ad. The developers didn’t care to make a decent game. The game should be called “idle battle loss ad watch simulator”. You lose and lose until you do slightly better thanks to an ad and still lose. Don’t waste your time. Force these money hungry devs to make a decent game."
5,Disgraceful consumer,"Its not a simulator in the sense you would expect it to be. Its more of an age of war game, bc you level up each age, but it’s different bc you can farm the previous age, or you can advance as far as you can. There arent any ads( unless you want there to be, its way easier with ads) and its no wifi. Definitely not boring"
4,SgtTucan,"This game is great. The art style is simple and the game is very very easy to understand and play. But, the only problem is the progression of this game. It is extremely slow. I spent some 30 minutes after I first downloaded and I have yet to deal even 100 dmg to the cave in the first level. I’m always down for a grinding game but this one is just much much slower than other mobile games I’ve played."
5,DaniHumble,This is the best game ever! It is so fun and challenging. Its challenging because you have to attack the enemy base with your troops and you have to have a strategy to pull it off and level up the food production to get more troops out there. To get better troops you have to evolve. It also educational because it tells you when the civilization was made and how it was made.
5,i love u gaem,"This game is great and I got it because, I have this Minecraft thing where I go to Chattanooga to play Minecraft with people. I've been away for a long time and I came back. I saw one of my friends pkaying this game and I called it, ""Ripoff Battle Cats"". Few days later I got an ad for this game and i thought, ""Hey, this is the game Mark was playing."" and i got the game and im quite good.  Thanks for reading, Sincerely, Liam"
5,The_crimson_eye535,"You have to do a lot of grinding to get on your feet at first but once you have the right stuff and a good strategy you can win, it took me like 3-4 days just to finish the first level. Overall just a great game, no forced adds which I love, it’s highly recommended from me, so I hope that’s enough to convince you, because if not idk what else to say"
5,tjminnick,"Good game. You are not required to watch ads to play, but they vastly help progression. Slow start but you can build up your power over time. It took me a week of playing every now and then to beat the first levels but I never felt I was stuck. Completing daily missions and watching ads helped progression quite a bit"
1,Richtu l,"Hello I been playing this game for a couple weeks now and just recently bought something called a “mini event offer “ , not only did they take my money but they gave me some stuff I can’t even use , and those red potions ? Why would you guys give me 6 and make base health 8 to complete to get to the others ? You guys really gave the worst one and I can’t help but feel angry at how much of a rip off your guys whole game is, oh and heads up if your reading this you literally have to watch over 100 ads just to beat a single time line"
1,Just a kid named Ryan,The more you evolve the harder the enemies become. More hp and damage. So by the 5th evolution the enemies are 1.77x stronger. Which means your 3food person died against their 3food person. It forces you to buy gems to unlock cards to improve your characters damage and health. Gets to a point where all the enemies will always have health remaining when going against the same troop but yours. Makes it twice as hard and annoying. Why punish us for playing the game? Don’t you want us to keep playing? Makes no sense. Should be able to turn it off.
4,Eldiablos420,"the 2x and 3x multiplier is only useable on regular battles, not events which I believe it should be a universal multiplier, the main game is completely unnecessary to have that much of a multiplier as even before the purchases I was speeding through the timelines. PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THE MULTIPLIERS UNIVERSAL FOR EVENTS AND MAIN GAME, other than that great game, very fun it takes a little grinding but when you get up in levels it gets pretty easy compared to start."
5,Yourfastboi,"Best game I have played ever the levels are so fun, they don’t force ads on you and it’s so easy to go up a evolution and once you do it’s so easy to defeat your previous one and the mechanics are fun the animations are funny and silly and two buttons upgrade everything as simple as that would recommend for survival games 10/10"
5,RipSprite,"This game is really fun, but it takes a long time to progress. For example, you have to wait hours to get your task back. Also, the cards are the main reason you can have progression, but it mostly cost money for them. Can you guys pls not make us wait for task, because it makes us progress and have more fun. Thank you"
4,iamtheanonymousrater,"The game is great and it’s really fun, but the ads are messed up. While you don’t have to watch ads, you can watch ads to boost things for a temporary length of time or temporary amount of something. I like this aspect of the game, except once an ad is over, I have consistently waited 3-5 minutes (again, once the ad is OVER) for the “x” to pop up to close the ad."
3,5 golf balls,Couldn’t upgrade properly. The upgrade tab would show the character and food spawn upgrade button but it won’t scroll down to the other upgrades can just barely tap the upgrade below the food one but its a tiny sliver of the button and I don’t even know what the upgrade does. If I hit the evolution button it covers the whole upgrade screen. I will reconsider giving this game a retry once it is fixed
1,ashywjrxjeb,"Poor game design, you’re smashing your head into your phone until you get an “upgrade” then you live 2 seconds longer, wait longer to get another “upgrade”. Rinse and repeat. The AI is 100x stronger than you. You’re incentivized to watch adds so you can hate yourself slightly less. There isn’t strategy either, the enemy units come out at the same order and time regardless of what you do. No delaying your units to manipulate spawn times, no specific targeting or movement selection. You might as well get on a PC and pirate Cartoon Wars, better than this game in every aspect."
5,ITsYaFavOrite,"This is a super fun game for when your bored and laying around, it has adds to where you can get more ‘food supply’ and beat your enemies! Other then that there are no adds and I haven’t tried this game offline so I’m not sure if it works offline. The animation characters are super cute and vintage, I definitely recommend this game it’s so much fun!"
1,Allenkms7753,Game was honestly fun until you get to timeline 7 then you reset and go back to the beginning and re play as if you were in timeline 1 again then when you get around timeline 15 the difficulty is so hard you have to play way more on one type of people which means watching more ads and the ads were barely manageable when you would progress faster but I can’t see how you make it to timelines 20+. I would enjoy the game a lot more if you could pick what timeline and replay or maybe custom your own battles…
1,ZZ Smooth,"If you want a game that has ads, this is your goldmine. It’s slow, monotonous, and eventually unplayable, but you get ads. Want to double the mediocre amount of coins you have? Ads. Want to make the game go faster? Ads. Want to add some extra food for more troops that will eventually get slaughtered mere seconds after spawning? You get TWO ads for that. Per day. Eventually the cost of upkeep outweighs the ability to pay for them, and that basically ends any enjoyment one might have found in the early stages. It shouldn’t take a month to advance one level."
5,Could you change it?,This company has the best games I’ve ever played. They’re so easy and the sound effects are so soothing and I could sit and watch the little characters move and work for hours. There is no ads but you always have an option to watch a short ad for a pretty good upgrade in the game. These games are so relaxing and so fun and cute.
5,xMckinneyx,For me I’m quick to delete a game if it’s littered with ads this one seems to have zero ads unless you want to watch them to double your earnings I love that. Only reason I’d give it like 4.5 stars is because I can’t pay for the game (like $3-5) to get rid of the ads and get the double bonus ad free. Other than that it’s fun and worth downloading.
5,cp348,"I actually don’t have any issues with the game itself, it’s just something simple to mindlessly do while I’m at work with nothing to do. No ads are necessarily forced on you, but I wish they weren’t so long.  I understand it’s a way to actually generate revenue but there’s no need for the ads to be longer than a round in the game"
4,No fun when you progress,"So this game is good until you get farther in the game so like at the beginning, it’s all fun then the farther you progress throughout the game it gets less fun because you played it so much and you wanna play some other game so that makes me think that this game isn’t so good. I know it’s good, but it’s not the best I would say I would probably be a good game just I can’t say it’s the best game ever"
4,john0193745291,"This game is very fun and enjoyable with no ads, i have an ad blocker on my wifi and makes the game more enjoyable, it’s also nice that the game doesn’t force ads on you. But it has a little problem, so feel like when you first start off you don’t get enough money and everything is really expensive. Only problem in my opinion, keep up good work"
5,MrSev340,"Honestly I thought this was gonna be one of those annoying pop up ads games that are always promoted on other games. But the only time you have adds is if you decide to watch it for a reward. You decide. That’s a big thing for me. Other than that, the grind is actually really fun."
5,Rade Saber,"Not a bad add watching the experience either. Your not interrupted by ads every single minute and you have the choice to watch them or not. You can probably sit there for hours and grind out coins or use an ad to double every now and then which is wonderful and very balanced, and the model designs are really neat and fun to watch battle."
5,Bardman2011117,"The game is very fun and definitely reminds me of older games i played. But what most impressed me is the lack of forced ads. So refreshing to not have to watch an add after each round, but you have the option to watch and double your coins which I end up watching the ad anyway a lot of the time, but I’m not forced to."
1,some random gibberish,"If you enjoy doing the EXACT SAME THING over and over and over again, and the only reward being that you get to do it AGAIN, this might be a game for you. I might’ve actually refrained from writing this review (and just deleted the game instead) if not for the stupid dungeons that you can’t upgrade your troops for, so at a certain point they just become unbeatable and you bash your head into their brick wall time and time again. No point to playing this game there is ZERO rewarding feeling at all."
1,Hauser H,"This game is a cool little remake of the classic flash game Age of War. It’s well made and fun for about 5 minutes. Then it becomes really grindy. The only way to advance is by playing the same level like 100 times and when you finally get to the next stage, you realize it’s just a reskin of the stage you just beat but harder. The one way to speed this process up is by watching a lot of ads. The game heavily encourages it and it’s clearly the goal of the developer to get you to watch as many ads as possible rather than have fun and progress at a reasonable rate."
1,HonestReviewFromARealPerson,"This game progresses way too slow to be entertaining and is much worse than I had initially hoped for. Upgrading barely makes a difference and the card collecting aspect was a weak idea with poor execution.  Needs a lot of work before it will be worth playing.  Credit where it is due: as far as I could see, the ad viewing scheme did not force ads like other games. Only an optional thing to double money at the end of a battle and for extra gems in the shop. Great choice by the developers, especially where this game will be a heavy grind."
4,Falling Lots,"It follows the standard mechanic of costs increasing faster than your abilities, requiring more time and effort to progress the farther into the game you get.  Doesn’t force ads or purchases on you, but readily tempts you with them to speed progression up, because once you figure out the battle mechanics, the only thing left is winning. And the time between wins increases, as I mentioned."
5,Bestgama rater,Here is my second review really fun game really good art style really fun game to grind but I’m stuck on the space level which I like the game except the NPC’s have so much money and they buy everything still really fun game. Love to see updates and more things to this game. One of the best really best mobile game.   #love the game.      #best game #  I   need more updates
4,ZacheryF,Hey I quite like the app but I have one suggestion. Often times I can’t complete my daily missions on the app without watching adds I’ve considered streaming content even with this app but the adds oftentimes break the calming environment of the game. My suggestion would be for a VIP version for around 2.99 where you don’t need adds to compete all daily quests. Great game keep it up!
1,Killer115,This game cool and all but the amount of adds  needed to watch in order to pass the daily challenges and missions are insane. Progression in this is slower than any phone game ever because they set it up to where you have to watch ads to win certain levels or play forever because the cost of coins versus adding time to the clock is trash. Don’t recommend this garbage game. Can’t even complete 3 day daily changes unless you spend money. Also the app loves to crash when you watch ads for extra food
5,Thatonereviewmaker,"As most of the other comments suggest, the game is in fact very grindy, especially early game when you are worse than the opponent, but after about 15-25 minutes of playtime the game begins to get good and you start to progress faster! I recommend this game to people who are bored often with nothing to do."
5,binxie kitten,This game is so fun you can play non stop and beat the other side easily with a bit of upgrades and positivity you just have to keep trying and do your best don’t let the enemy get you! This game is completely awesome and I wish I can play forever. Plus this game is ad free unless you need a super power or more food!
3,Me2020123,The reseat of your money every time you move up in the “evolution “ is really frustrating and takes the game from a fast fun game to starting all over.    Also you can’t use food gained when you defeat an enemy stronghold so there is no point in not using all of your food resources every time.  Update these resets would make the game better in my opinion because it would give a continuation of game play at a faster pace.
5,Jeremiah sutton01,"Really good game and i love the concept, i feel as though progression is fairly slow one thing that i think would be cooler is brian’s able to travel back to previous timelines and play those again. Either way really good game and would recommend if you wanna play a game to pass the time"
5,person147213,Love the game and couldn’t stop playing. My only major issue is when I evolved from space age to timeline 2 I couldn’t go back to space age. I was so mad! Also I think you should male We Are Warriors sandbox were you can take any fighters and battle them kinda like TABS Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. Please take this into consideration.🙂
5,less ads plzzzzzzz,I love this game it is so addictive you can upgrade from Stone Age and then to farm rage and then I’m right now at Warrior age and it’s still so fun it’s like having so many stuff going on because not only do you have to upgrade your speed but at the same time have skill at it that’s why I think you should download it because it’s so freaking fun
1,brooo tiktok,"Game doesn’t really work of skill as much as more and more rewards advance the only Way you can advance or not get demolished to essentially watch ads to double your rewards… needs less rewards or more benefits to every level. Literally another ad trap and the ads are literally wildly repetitive and long- they are essentially selling the clicks to an App Store app. I call it an app trap of seeing and clicking and literally sampling and downloading more and more! Jk but it’s not multiplayer and its so fun, but the ad necessity to even compete is a lot."
1,Shoots33Blah,"I enjoyed the game when I started. Game play is sluggish but offered ads to speed up game play or a once time purchase to permanently speed up the game play. Today they decided that they were doing away with the game speed park, but instead of refunding, they decided they would offer a different perk, want it or not.  Now the game play is too slow to be enjoyable with no option to speed it up. The new extra-gold perk is useless if the game is too dull to enjoy playing.  I’ve spent some good money on this game but today Im done."
4,roz1025,"The AI of this game is insane. From the very first mission, the opposing side has max health, all enemy types, and spawn rate (food production). It’s a nice little grind game. The only way to get coins for upgrades is battling. The gems are only for the cards which raise your troop health and attack damage based off a percentage. There is more to the game but I just downloaded today. I’ll try and post an update later"
2,Jove_MusiQ,I really wanted to enjoy this game for longer than I did. However getting into the game it takes WAAAYYY too long to level up.   The CPU starts with a power of 500 and you have like 5. You barely beat that level and the next round the CPU has 4.7k and you barely have 73 😒. Even trying to spawn things isn’t fast enough. Game could be a lot better and cooler with the proper level ups but yeah. This eventually gets old trying to beat levels that start out way unfair.
1,Solomnno10,"It’s either you’re going to be easily overwhelmed by the enemy or you’ll upgrade to the point where you stomp over the enemy where they have no chance. You get to do that for one level and then it’s back to being overwhelmed. There is no strategy it’s just watch a video for the coin bonus and upgrade and grind. The enemies tactics never change, whatever you do doesn’t matter because it’s all about the upgrade to food production. Of course they want to charge you for features that should be free like speeding the game up."
3,brtbohhi,"""When I was starting out, I played my first match. When I saw how much time it took for one thing of my food production to be finished, my opponent was already halfway to my base. I had no way to defend myself, so I watched an ad for ten food. I was beating my opponent for a little, then they spawned a dinosaur that I could not defend against, and it took out my base in one hit."" The overall game is good it is just a ad after ad type of game if you want to win."
3,The JoBoo,"Fun game and you need to develop strategies to advance. You will have to grind.  Wouldn’t be too bad but you need to watch copious amount of ads that are very repetitive, and mess up the in game sounds. About every 3rd ad makes the in game sounds turn off - very annoying.   It’s a free game and I’m currently enjoying the grind, but better quality ads and ones that don’t break the game will keep me around longer."
5,Kay Bugg,"A super fun and addicting game. I’m always looking out for just nice relaxing games I can play at the end of the day that are going to keep me entertained but won’t get boring and this game is it. Keeps events going but doesn’t bombard you with them, and has lots of upgrades for your game to keep you motivated to keep playing. Love it!"
5,Lex liz,"This game is so amazing! You get to upgrade your production to make more warriors faster. You can upgrade your base’s health too so it isn’t as easy for your opponent to destroy it. There are no adds while doing those two things or any adds at all really! I recommend you getting this game and if you already have it, have fun."
2,Jon Vuri,"Looks like a ""strategy"" game, but is actually just an idle clicker in terms of progression being entirely gated on time. Nothing but losing battles and getting a trickle of coins each time - with ads and purchases dangled every few seconds to speed it up, of course. Not even very interesting compared to other idle clickers, and slower than most. If there were even a tiny hint of strategy with unit allocation, positioning, etc it might make it a bit fun. As is, total waste of time."
4,dilpicklezz,"This is a great game and it has no forced ads! My only complaint about a that sometimes you have the option the double your income if you watch an ad, but sometimes the game just freezes when watching one, and you lose all your income from your battle. Other than that, very fun game with a ton of features.😃"
5,I got aim,I’m almost on “Timeline 10” so I have experience with this game … I think overall it is a great game …. Sometimes the AI can be extremely difficult tho lol …. But I see that has getting better at the game and actually grinding it for better stuff… the game is good … I wish there was more in game purchases … the shop seems super plain .. good game tho . It’s a grind .
1,Kidzpjeff,"The best way to win in this game quick is to watch ads and double your coins. BUT, several times in last few days when watching ads all I have is a black screen. Only option is to close game which loses not only the ad but the coins I did win in the last battle! Tried waiting on ad to finish with black screen, after several minutes it still hasn’t. I want to make this at least a 4 star game even with needing to watch ads to win, but the black screen ads ruin this game."
1,The Me1979,"""The game currently has a notable limitation in its production speed, which cannot be expedited through in-game purchases. This aspect, while adding a strategic challenge, might frustrate players looking for faster progression. Additionally, the purpose and mechanics of the summoning feature remain ambiguous, leaving players uncertain about its benefits or how to effectively utilize it. Despite these issues, the game shows potential. With further development and refinement, particularly in explaining its features and balancing its pacing, it could offer a more engaging and satisfying experience."
4,cncsmith3318,So I’ve been progressing through this for a while and saw an ad in for permanent one and a half speed for $11 I thought why not however he gives you no advantage whatsoever while your gameplay is going at 1 1/2 speed there’s still going at one and a half speed is a competitor as well don’t waste your money buying the add on.
3,Prime624,"I really want to like this game, and it kept me playing for longer than I thought it would, but ultimately it's not currently a good game. Calling the gameplay ""grindy"" is too generous, it's really just repetitive and monotonous. The basic loop is 1) play 20 second game, earn coins, 2) spend coins on minuscule increases in game income, 3) play 21 second game, where the first 2 seconds are identical to the last game played, and the last second is the only novelty."
1,Wxlfe951,Why do I have to choose between grind for days or watch an ad after every battle just to proceed? I also got to the last age but had to pay $2.50(yes I know very cheap) just to beat the last level after watching every ad possible for every buff and couldn’t beat it without the purchase   After that I admit it’s a little more interesting but I expect I’ll have to pay again later on or end up grinding for hours which would end up with me deleting the app but we’ll see
5,Skele-Skull,"The game was very hard at the start witch really sucked but the more I played the game, the more I won’t give up. The game shows you that, No matter of what gets in your way. Keep trying! And also, this game allows you to choose whether you wanna watch an ad for a benefit or not which is really good."
4,jfofdjrd,Overall a great game to waste a little time on its of course not a triple a game but the progression isnt too grindy and it’s monetization isnt too pushy. instead of forcing ads on you or making them nearly mandatory to progress it just encourages you to watch them to make things go a little faster which i appreciate overall id recommend getting this
1,MoonPai314,"I saw this game from a forced ad in a different one and it looked entertaining enough.  The progression is INCREDIBLY SLOW and you are all but forced to waste time watching ad after ad just to get the resources needed to slowly unlock more units and speed up food production.  One of the elements of the game involves evolving yourself to a more advanced civilization to strengthen your units.  However, upon doing so you will reset all of your progression and basically be forced back into watching more and more ads.  I cannot suggest this game any less."
4,Mkschenk,"Need a way to pay for no ads. Maybe pay some kind of currency for things that would otherwise require an ad.   One game change I would like is, when you are in game and you select the strong arm power up, I would like to be able to un-select it. Sometimes I change my mind or I hit it too soon."
4,Sav_Tay,"This game is so addictive! I love it. It’s fun, graphics are nice, but my favorite thing? All ads are OPTIONAL Only complaint is that each upgrade is pretty expensive and only gets +.02 steaks/second or +1 castle strength when the opponent has castle strength of 500 and we only started with like 2. After hours of playing I’m only at like 20 and haven’t been able to win a round yet"
1,Bananabrad,"Once you get past the tutorial. Which is timeline 2 and very early. You are forced to watch an incessant amount of ads or pay if you want to progress at all. The event that came out was the nail in the coffin for me. In short the battle takes 2 min so you can kill a single unit which gives you enough money to buy an upgrade once every 5 runs. And it exponentially scales. But dont worry, the devs offer a 25$ event pack for their 2 day event just so that you can progress. Its clear they are making a cash grab."
4,Teti_vita,Is it just me or has anybody else ever thought of levels being sooo difficult to pass? Like battle 6 I’ve been stuck on that battle for like an eternity. I feel like the AI’s food production is like 10 meat per second!! It just makes me so frustrated! Overall this is not a bad game but please fix this they are way to powerful. Unless you tell me how to beat it😏.
4,Ddubs1988,"Game is fun and challenging in ways but to advance quicker add help double up your rewards and no ads have brought issues…except solitaire cash, it freezes my game every time that ad pops up and has completely turned me off of trying to advance, it’s the most used ad other than royal crash or whatever."
3,Mb12hgdas,"The game is fun, but is very repetitive because it is just the same board over and over and over and over again. I’m like other reviews, I feel that the game is heavily reliant on ads and that you need to watch them to your rewards, if you do not want to put actual money into buying coins. Overall it is not a bad game and find myself playing it for hours at a time"
5,Bad luck is this game,This was very challenging and first when I started but then it got easier when I played a little bit more it's really fun and makes you use the brain how you win or how you can idk but this is a very very good game and I should try it if I were you but you don't have to but you can bye: )
1,HonestGamingReviews,"This game doesn’t force you to watch ads all are optional, but if you want to progress faster it helps to watch the multipliers at the end. Good luck getting the rewards though, I’ve just downloaded this game and played maybe an hour and everytime I want to watch an ad to double my wave coins it’s a 50/50 on wether the ad plays till the end before glitching out and not giving you the reward, or not connecting back to the game after the ad is over and closing out the game will cancel the bonus."
3,Me158933689,"The recent update literally made it if you beat an enemy, you cannot progress immediately like you could before. You have to play again and save up currency to evolve. This makes progress even slower than it was before which was already really slow. Seems like the Devs are Willy nilly making changes without thinking things through"
1,PaulBick,"This used to be a fun way to pass the time; but, suddenly overnight my progress has come to a screeching halt. It was not gradual slowdown across a series of battles or levels that got increasingly harder. No, it was immediate. And, so, it seems pretty obvious what happened.   This leads me to believe they nerfed the game and slowed progress and rewards in an attempt to create more in-game purchases. I imagine though that many, like me, will just leave though.   To be on only level 26 and have spent money on the game already….probably @ $30. That’s absurd. Bye guys!"
4,zackyiswacky,"now this game is fun but I feel like they should make progress a bit easier, like it took me 30 minutes just to get the 1st evolution which I think should be just a tad bit easier. Also I think you should make the food production price lower. besides that it's a pretty good game, definitely recommend if there's nothing for you to do and are bored"
5,Kitten479537,"I just started playing, but I enjoy it so far! The graphics are simple and cute, and each battle round only takes a few minutes max so far. The ada being skippable after about 10 seconds is awesome, so you’re not wasting 2/3 of your playing time watching ads."
4,Sosyozheuxjzltsydxbyzyd,"Please add a more accurate description for the torpedo unit in the deep sea event. I just spent $23 to level up my damage from passive potions. My damage says it’s 3 higher than the opponent’s health, however, that only one-shots a single unit. The splash does not kill the others. I would just like to know how much less damage the splash damage does compared to the damage stated. Or is this a bug?"
1,Corey Myers,"I’ve played up thru timeline 7 and there are 3 currencies available thus far. Green diamonds, blue potions, and red potions.   Green diamonds are readily available thru daily tasks and you could exchange them for blue potions prior to the last patch. But they’ve removed that option and the difficulty multiplier increase thru each age dramatically requires spells enhanced thru blue potions.   I restarted the game back to timeline 1 thinking the option was removed from which timeline I was in, but when I made it back to timeline 3 (where blue potions become available), the exchange button was still gone.   Please restore exchanging green diamonds for blue potions. I like this game, I’ve paid $10 for the speed increase. But I will not be playing more until the developers restore currency exchange. I will rerate with 5 stars once they do."
5,weathered dayz,"Fun game but the ads make it not fit to play.  Should be easier to leave the ads once you earn the rewards.  Any game who is going to make it hard for me to close their ad, automatically isn’t someone I want to have anything to do with."
4,mia123456786326,This game is so fun and it keeps me glued to my phone all the time. that is kind of a bad thing though but it is really fun and I recommend it to all ages of course through the limt it already says but I rate it 4 stars because there are too many ads and you shouldn't have to watch ads to get more coins either. But overall it's is a great game!
1,✰✰✰✰✰✰,"After playing for a few days, this game feels more like it’s forcing you to watch ads to progress faster and sets up the incentives as such.   The battles are generally split into stages of progression and even if you used your head, there’s no going around the fact that enemies are terribly advantages until you earned enough gold to progress to the next part, which can be sped up by ads.  Dungeons are extremely limited and too challenging for their rewards. This game feels more like a cash grab than a game."
5,Dakuyellow,"This game does have ads but they’re not forced between rounds (except for certain daily challenges for gems) gems buy power up cards that are upgradable, and all cards add up for total damage increase. Reminds me of a “flash” game I used to play on my parents desktop ages ago."
3,LLuucckkyyBb,The games fun and all but the amount of work necessary to feel strong for 1 battle is just no fun! I should feel strong more than 10% of the time. You fight 20 fights then you’re finally strong enough  to win one round then it resets and you get beat up until you’ve earned enough for that one good match then it’s back to reset…. Vicious cycle!  Let us earn more in the early rounds maybe…?
3,Emble loves dragon city,"This game is good at all like how there’s barely any ads and the games style is unique to its great but one thing that really pushes down my rating is that the game DATA does not save when you delete the game and download it back you have to restart ALL OVER AGAIN, so if you could please fix this problem where your data could be saved this game would be one of the best games I’ve played in my life."
2,Hate dk2,"This was actually my favorite game for a bit. Ads are intrinsic, again no real issue, that’s how the game is monetized. Problem is the broken ads. There are ads that cycle repeatedly, apparently forever. This causes lost progress, and for me at least it’s game breaking. Gets a second star because at its core it’s actually a good game, but right now it’s unplayable.  Maybe I’ll come back to it and they’ll have fixed it. For now, disappointingly broken."
5,Grognak22,"Cannot get enough, I’ve figured out a couple tricks to bypass “slow” progression and it’s become rather enjoyable. I enjoy it so much to the point I find myself playing it for at least 30 minutes. And I rarely play games for longer than 10 minutes."
4,Another Redneck from Arkansas,"This is a simple kind of game I can get behind! Sadly the ads are just to much. Like one review says, progression is driven by ads. 11 dollars for lifetime 1.5 speed? Why not give us an option to remove ads and let us double our rewards still? Yeah you could just not watch ads but if I wanted meaningless grinding, I go back to play RuneScape."
1,Ogden Thorsap,"You’d have a less painful experience practicing acupuncture on yourself from a children’s board book using rusty nails. This is textbook mindless game design. The only way this game has 4.5 stars with 20k+ ratings is through AI manipulation. Seriously. As I came to try and save lives here, there was a completely accurate negative review with a 4 star rating. WTA?!? I only played as long as I did through sheer morbid curiosity AND because the art is kind of cute. The art is all that earned my 1 star. Run! Don’t walk away from this drain of your soul and life.."
2,Play Storm Bound,"I liked the concept of your game. Despite it being an ad farm I played along for a while, and I watched the maximum amount of ads for extra rewards. Well as of yesterday the ads have went from 30 seconds to at least a minute long. I am NOT going to watch a 3 minute ad for 100 of your coins that will increase my damage by 4% after I watch 7 more of them. I am quitting the game because of this. I gave you an inch and you tried to take a mile."
1,stbwilly,"Potentially good. Ads are only way to make game playable. The power resets are too much. Catching back up shouldn’t take 5-10 mins every time you hit a new world because your resource gain is much too slow. Especially when unit for unit, the computer can spawn 100+ points of summons and nothing can be done about it. Only watching ads grinding back for 1 powe up. And then watch an add to double your gains: end up watching an ad every min or so. None actually required to play the game. But, painfully slow progress without watching.z"
5,star rater7,"At first, I thought I was gonna get bored of the game in 2 hours, because most ads lie, but when I played it, it was actually really fun, in fact I enjoyed it so much that I’m already addicted to the game! And this is my first time playing it, to you guys out there, you gotta install this app, it’s worth it!"
1,EpicUnicat,"If you want something super slow this is the game for you. Want to grind for months on end and get literally nowhere? Play this one.  It takes 3 meat to spawn the base level troop, once he spawns he can only kill 1 or 2 enemies before dying. After that you’re waiting another 30 minutes just to spawn a second troop. The meat time upgrade is sooooo slow. The enemies kill your castle in a few hits. The cards are 100 gems, and you only get 400 as given gems per day.  This game gave me depression it’s so slow and boring"
5,Papa Ratique,I think that the game is very simple because you just upgrade stuff to become the strongest and it goes a good pace to play at. The only thing I would recommend is that there should more upgrades. That is all and I would recommend this game if you haven’t already played it😁
3,YEEEEE BRAH,"Progression is incredibly slow and so is obtaining the green coins you need to get upgrade cards. If you like spending lots of time with a game this is for you, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.   Ads aren't necessarily forced onto you in this game, but if you want to progress to the next level in 5 minutes instead of 30 then you'll have to sit through them."
4,Oldreligion1,This is a good way to kill some time especially when you get used to how to progress. Though it does crash occasionally when you finish a battle and try to watch a video for x2 the coins which you will have to restart the app and you won’t get that bonus like that match didn’t happen
2,Kenaxel,"Too many ads. It’s obviously just designed to farm ads. There are ads to win prizes, double points, speed up gameplay, win premium currency, and enter some zones in the game.   I’d happy pay for an ad-free version of this game, but one not being available tells you everything you need to know about the reason for this game.   If you don’t mind wasting half and hour watching ads for every 15 minutes of gameplay, this one’s for you."
4,hiii?!?$@,"This game is amazing you can upgrade fast it has made me rage but it is fun at the same time the part I like the most is the fact that there are no adds unless you force them I have only had this game for 2 days and im almost on the renaissance also I love music and you can listen to music watch Netflix,YouTube exc I 100% recommend"
1,skxkskskxkxksnzz,"This is not a game. It’s literally just a way to get you to watch ads and make them money. every game you make less than enough money for an upgrade and even when you make money for an upgrade, it’s very minimal. you can speed the process up (x2 coins) by watching ads.   game is very repetitive with no point other than to make you watch ads to double your coins to save up for expensive and barely noticeable upgrades to keep repeating the same level over and over again."
5,Game specialities,"This is probably one of my favorite games just because of the difficulty. And as of posting this, I don’t think you can make your own maps. So developers, if you read this, please add a make your own map mode. Thank you for reading."
1,Oscarishere,"I've been playing this game for over a week now and while at first it seems fair, as in no purchases needed, or having to watch thousands of ads to progress. That quickly changes if you're not spending money you'll nearly be frozen in a level unless your are willing to watch thousands of ads or spend some money. The game is fairly fun at first but now there is placing me in position where I better start spending my money or my time just to progress."
5,Snaperay,I play this game almost exclusively and have spent more then I would like to admit. But without it working properly I’m very sad today. Did the update and keys and stuff like that aren’t updating. If you haven’t updated yet please do lol so you will be delayed like me till they fix it :p
3,dmaseyj,"Overall pretty fun game. Grindy as progression is slow unless you watch ads. Any time i get an ad by Instagram, you watch the entire video and it wont let you click the ‘X’ to complete and just leaves you there with no way out of it, have to force close game and you lose your progress and no reward. Instagram is huge so a lot of the ads are by them, super annoying"
2,Keithmacdonald,"Good gameplay and fun for about 10 minutes, until you realize each level is just the same mind game over and over as you attempt to figure out how to make your team strong enough to defeat the simulation. Unfortunately, any progress you make is removed once you level up, and therefore every round you start from the beginning once again. This gets very boring on the 2nd or third round. A massive disappointment."
4,Some-Random_guy,Your telling me it took you months to beat the first “level” or timeline either your doing something wrong or your just stupid the game isn’t even that hard. Now for the actual review game pretty good good for when bored I like. Also this looks like an age of empire game but it’s much more fun than the actual game. Surprising right
5,Reageeroo09,"Okay. This game to me is amazing!!! Only one thing. Please change it so you don’t loose all of your progress after evolving, you work so hard to get all of your upgrades just for them to be reset. Other then that this game is really fun and not any ads well you are playing."
5,Racin Randy,"Doesn’t shove ads down your throat between runs like some games do. They all seem to be optional with pretty good benefits that make it worth it when you do watch an ad.   Gameplay is super fun, isn’t super easy ever really but figuring out the strategy you need to win with the different troops is always fun"
1,Stickmom5,"Honestly it was very fun to play at first, although a little grindy but not too bad for a mobile game, but by the third stage it is nearly impossible to advance without watching an ad after every single level you play and even with that I can’t get any further. I watched ads for the gems in the shop and completed all the challenges and it seems to only way to do better on the third stage would be to spend money on it already. I’m very disappointed because I honestly had fun playing it."
3,RC2020!,"This game has been a fun one with enough to keep you interested without over complicating it. However, my one gripe is that when you watch an ad for a bonus or boost, there’s like a 40% chance that you’ll get whatever you’re watching the ad for, it’ll just end and prompt you to watch another ad. Very annoying. Other than that it’s a great game!"
5,SheanC123,Great game by far.  I have not been more addicted to a phone game than this one. Been playing for about 1.5 months now.  I have upgraded everything and waiting for another update to give me more things to do. I’m currently at level 705 and will try to find the end.
3,Impulse00001,"To get ahead, you’ll spend more time watching ads than playing the game. The developer offers a one time purchase to remove ads for 1.5 game speed, but it still doesn’t equate to the cost/value you receive.   It’s a shame, because the game mechanics itself is a lot of fun to progress through! I hope the ad overkill is addressed soon."
5,wwesylas,Very fun game to play. If you’re bored in the car or you’re just bored in general in your house one update I would like to see is the addition of being able to equip different guns respiratory stuff for your characters as they’re in there it is a very very good game. I would recommend it.
1,this game BAD!!! 😡uwu,"It’s really grindy and really boring I  dislike it. Plus one really annoying thing is that there is NO PAUSE BUTTON. Well, actually there is but it does not do anything except show a pop up asking if you want to quit while the game continues in the background. Plus its super repetitive. Keep in mind I only played this game for like 5 hours in total. I would recommend to someone who likes long grindy annoying games. If not though it’s not really worth your time."
1,kingofandals,The game names it so difficult to play with the continual bombardment of ads.  They try so hard to make it a endless game that It becomes repetitive. There’s no real sense of growth or gain over time it just becomes boring same old same old get killed. Bulk up. Kill and restart. It’s pretty boring. The events FORCE you to play the game for an entire 24 hrs to even gain anything from them. I do have a life outside the game. I’d like something that garners more in the long run rather than just wasting my time.
1,STEVEapeSNIPER,"Watch adds for bonus Problem ; the solitary ad keeps replaying and replaying every time you try to tap to close it just replays and replays and replays so you have to close your game and restart it and then lose your original coins plus the coins they promised for watching the ad not once but five times ,hate advertisers What a bunch of trolls!……………………….   and PS even if you hit no ads for bonuses, it still pushes ads so the first review is a lie it pushes ads, even if you don’t click on them"
4,Gamrno1,"My experience playing this game is good, and it is a very balanced game too. The only reason I rated it four stars are the ads. Sure, they reward you, and sure, they are optional, but it’s a lot of ads. I do recommend playing this game, though, since it is very fun and is better than a lot of other free game."
3,Ehdge,"However… since a recent update, the app now locks up after viewing an ad, thus forcing you to relaunch the app, AND of course watching yet another ad to obtain the benefit you were expecting. (Sometimes this issue will cost you a benefit that is only available once or twice which makes it extremely frustrating.)  Still not fixed."
2,Coleodog,"The game is very basic and straight forward. The ages only differ slightly. You have to watch ads every 5 minutes if you want to do the speed up option. Otherwise the game is ABYSMALLY SLOW. Oh it’s not $1 or $2 to buy the permanent but $11! Please do not spend any money on this greedy developer. Everything is obscenely overpriced. Overall though, the game is a good way to pass the time, but don’t expect anything ground breaking from it"
5,Hakasfusfus,Game is nice snd all but now i am afraid i will losse all this progess if someone acedently delevt this game off this device also some time when i am not using my phone i also like to contuniue progress in laptop …. Its most addictive game i have ever played
5,g123412341234,"There is not a whole lot to this game. It is straight forward and easy to understand… yet it leaves you wanting more! Starting small and growing bigger and bigger is always a thrill. Strategies are endless and even so, they all work! So take your time, enjoy the game and beat the enemy!"
1,Bswatz22,"The game isn’t a bad concept amazing little time waster. The game progression is like playing your favorite game but only the first level for about a week then you move on to the next level and you now have to play it for 2 weeks so on and so on. The upgrades are very little for what little coins you have, 0.2 per upgrade with an ever growing number of currency cost. The game never forced an ad on me but honestly I’d rather be forced an ad every once in a while then play this slow"
3,Noahhugoh,"The concept and art are cute, but the strategy becomes obvious after a few rounds. After that, it’s just a grind to farm resources to unlock the next evolution to take out the current level of enemies. Very little incentive or ways to take on more modern civilizations with lower ones, or mixing things up (perhaps you unlock those abilities after multiple playthroughs). Gets boring."
2,ArmandoRX7,"The beginning of this game is simply way too slow, it takes far too long to start up and get the game going. The beginning consists of constant trial and error just to rack up enough coins to level up and finally play the game The way it’s meant to be played. I played for around 20 minutes and still barely scratched the surface. They’ll ask you to watch an ad in order to get an edge"
2,TheLoneBandit,I got super hooked it is fun and challenging as it takes some strategy and timing to beat some levels but got to a point were it was grind through several matches to get a .02 thats right 0.02 increase in production or save up to get the discount on the 10 pack of bonus.  By the way you can NOT restore purchases i deleted as it was taking too much time and decided to pick it back up and as it was local save i lost the gems purchased
5,Game is so goodd,"Ok so this game is the best game ever but it’s just to easy like I am on timeline 5 in 3 days. Please add harder stuff and the events are A little bit hard but still easy please make like modes like easy mode,hard mode,hard mode,medium mode, and impossible mode thank you."
3,Gameguy_,"Game is fine, you get what you see and Im not upset about that, great offline no ad game. However it gets extremely repetitive since every 1st troop after an evaluation is just the 2nd troop of the previous era's cost. There is also no carry over after you evolve and you basically start from scratch with better units which makes me just not want to evolve at all. But as I said still a great no ad game."
5,LM Taylor,"I play every day. I love the events and the warriors are adorable. If I could make improvements it would be to add more historical battles or specific locations. I’m stuck on timeline 38, battle 5 and the warrior types get repetitive. I like the progression, specifically the increase of challenge."
5,hi stranger 🤠,"The art was pretty nice and it was addictive to my other friends. One issue though, sometimes when I’m watching an ad to double coins or something I can press the x so I had to restart the app and I didn’t get any coins at all. But everything else is really good."
3,SwankPants44513,"As many reviews have already said, this game is an ad watching simulator. If you want to progress at all, you have to watch ads. The combat targeting is weird as well, and there is a bug where when your troops push to the enemy building, if any ranged enemy spawns, they will be inside the building and cannot be damaged in any way, and they just pick away at my troops health. It is very annoying."
5,Peng_301,This game does have ads to double coins (which you obviously take) but they DO NOT force ads which we all love The gameplay is strategic when you play your timeline of characters or you die which is pretty cool! This game is a very good game👏 10/10👍
5,EvansFirstWorldProblems,Finally a company that makes a simple yet very fun and addictive game that you can ACTUALLY play. Not forced to watch an ad at any point in the game but the game makes watching ads worth it if you want to do it.  Hopefully other games can learn from this “bold” move
1,Sthurmen,"Honest review, I was kinda excited when I seen the app on an ad. Downloaded it and quickly realized how bad it was.  Level 1: Your base has 2hp - Opponent has 500 You have Food per second (used to summon troops) you start at .20. Impossible to win unless you watch every single ad after every battle for double. Max out Stone Age troops and still loose, then you upgrade your age, poof everything resets and enemy gets unlimited food. Dino rider is a tank that takes 10 hits to down, the enemy will send 20 at once and you loose. Don’t worry at this point you have made 600 coins in that battle, you can double it with an ad. But food upgrade is 1800 each that only goes up by .02 per second.  All in all 2 hours in game with every add watched, still on level 1 and can’t even half health the base."
5,yaboyIeky,It reminds me of that old game age of war but more cartoonish and newer and unlike a lot of new games it doesn’t force ads upon you every 30 seconds and you get to choose if you want to watch an ad or not for a reward
3,Aznttboy,"Grind type games for those that choose the harder path, but still beatable.  My main gripe is that to get the daily freebies by watching the ads, those ads takes a really long time to even load up. So if the point is to get some monetarization from ads, it has to be easier for the end users.  Otherwise, I am out."
1,Ghost freak 747217,"The latest update and it’s notes are omitting a lot of information. They’ve removed a paid function which was intended to be forever without advanced notice and without anything on the patch notes. To top it off they’ve given some in game incentive and changed the paid for bonus, while changing game settings to counter the bonus they’ve given. (You make x2 or x3 coins, but your food cost for troops has increased exponentially). Nothing was informed anywhere."
4,Advertisement is fake,This game is perfect for people who just want a idle game about fighting other beings. The only thing I wish is that it would have the same stuff like the adds where they are able to spawn a set amount versus another set amount of whatever they want they really take away the sandbox like as it’s shown in the ads.
2,TDS41,"Even with the “Forever” 1.5X speed unlocked. This game is so slow it’s easy to put down because it will bore you. The events I usually unlock one step., then set the game down because you have to replay for hours to make tiny progress. I would give it one star, but I like the theme of the game. The unbalanced nature of it, and how slow progress is needs serious improvement for it to be five stars."
4,EastcoastCatmaster,… It has lots of ads to double your coins earned or pay money or make very very slow progress. I watch ads quite a bit which makes me fall short of 5 star. Overall good game imo.  Edit: mistake on my part. Evolve as fast as possible. I am in modern and the AI is at space age and it seems I am bleeped. Their weakest unit quickly destroys my strongest unit.
2,RandyRandersonman,"I really want to like this game, I really do. But the only way to win is to watch ad after ad after ad after ad after ad to accumulate coins. Otherwise, the computer is going to absolutely swamp you. Maybe make it a little more fair eh? I’ll watch ads when I need to, to beat a challenge or something. But making the game so difficult to play that you have to watch ads to win is something else."
4,Chasingclouds52,"I love this game so so so much it only has optional ads and you earn lots of gold quickly! So you might be wondering why 4 stars.. wel the VERY first level I played took me 5 days to complete I had to evolve everything about my army, and watch ads. But otherwise I completely recommend this game if you have. 5 - 10 minutes to spare"
2,S G T Mario,From the start the game puts you in a mission where it is physically impossible to win. They set up shortcuts such as watching ads and paying with money for better characters just so you can win the first level. The game is also just not very interesting with the bland designs and the brainless concept. If you are fine with spending your money on this slop then spend it. There isn’t really any other way for you to win.
1,Maureengribbs,The first thing I noticed when I started playing was the at on the first level my base had one heart and the opponent had 500 hearts on the first level!! This game there is no way to progress without watching adds because every upgrade gives like a .2 buff and the price raises like 20 dollars per upgrade. Also all of the 5 star reviews for this game must be fake because if you read them it just disregards all of the complaints people have and flip them. Just an add farm don’t download.
4,hi homies i like to yeet,"I am playing on an iPad because this is the gaming iPad but when you are in upgrades, underneath the food production part, it won’t let me scroll down so I can upgrade the other parts of it. It only allows the food production upgrade. Please help. Other than that, it’s really fun"
5,sealington,"I love the art style of this game, the gameplay is light but in-depth & it doesn’t force ads every couple of minutes, because it doesn’t have ads anyways. You can choose whether to watch ads.  Nice game, I love playing it. To the devs, you’re artists."
4,Fedora_Fan101,"I was playing this game and during the farmers age I sent troops and one got stuck at the enemy’s base, he was able to attack but unable to be attacked by other melee attacks, however I only had this happen once and the game other than that was good, I only wish that the food production upgrades were permanent."
4,JohnX5000,For an age of war like game this is great. Starting off is really slow and I feel like the difficulty spikes fairly quickly. You aren’t going to win easily at first that’s for sure and takes awhile to build up to being able to win. If you don’t mind grinding a bit this game is great and good at consuming time.
5,fvyhg,Usually when I play games I get bombarded with 500 ads every second (exaggeration) but this game only gives you ads if you press the button it is a slow paced game but you will get hooked to it
3,Kinglydripp,"I like the concept of this game but when you upgrade your timeline for “x” amount, why would they take ALL the money you earned regardless of the cost?? They need to fix that. They push watching ads which is ok for me because I’d rather have the option to watch them for rewards rather than the ad playing by themselves & interrupting gameplay."
5,lolleirtt,"Honestly it’s a game that you don’t expect how it is until you download, when you do (if you do) use x2 food at the end of the round and upgrade food until it’s so expensive it’s not worth buying, THEN try buying new towers (or save of to evolve, your choice!"
5,cohhoyyyyyihgyofgcgiggivy,"I love this game, the art, gameplay, all the stuff just one thing is bothering me. It’s that you have to wait over and OVER. Can you make a speed up button for the fight? It takes soooooo long im just sitting there waiting for them. So please make a speed up function."
4,Mr monkey 44,Love the game same concept as age of war but with rebirths but when first starting out and after rebirthing it is slow idk how you could increase the speed maybe a little higher food rate at the start and I though of having a color customization for the soldiers but overall good
5,MikeLito10,This is honestly the best mobile game I have play I thought they there were going to be bunch of ads every single second but there are not and that’s enough for me to play the game   I also think the idea of telling people about the history is cool  Overall good game
5,"Dog12did Roblox, username",This is a real time consumer when you need to waste time. It’s also a really nice game. I love playing it. It’s a whole bunch of stuff you’re playing a game and you learn about history and stuff which one’s better and better and I’ll just love this game.
3,FunGames5000,"Great fun game until you hit the cheap pay wall tricks. Industrial psychology at its finest. Your characters line up just the wrong way, you start to need way more gold than you earn every loss, someone flies past you on a race at a rate you’d have to spend money to keep up with. Make the game fun and don’t pay them a dime. The actual programmers don’t get the money the owners do."
1,Magnentius,I was really enjoying this game. Have a lot of hours into it. Payed for several upgrades because I believe in paying people for their work. Participate in most of the events. Then I log in this morning to kill some time and there’s a message saying they’re taking away the paid speed boosts and giving me other in game materials in exchange. I was skeptical. I was right. The game is so unbearably slow now I’ll never play again. Way to destroy a game in one move.
4,caiden gamer,It’s is definitely a slow grind game I just sat here for a hour and didn’t get to the next evolution but if you love a grind you would like this game. The only down side to this game is the adds there is so many one every time after a battle etc but other wise it’s just like the adds showed.
2,Roofless Toofless,"Out the gate, this game is fun. But you will watch ads, Ads, ADS, and more ads. Most of the ads will be for regular gameplay while progression is also already slow. You will spend as much or more time watching ads as you will be playing. Granted, you can play without any ads, but progression is already painfully slow with the ads. Without the ads…cancel your life plans. Fun for a while, but…"
2,mikePL15,"The game is fun, ads are not forced upon you, but progression is slow.  If you decide to dedicate any meaningful amount of time to this game, you will learn that progression goes from slow to quite literally impossible… unless you spend money.  And it’s not just some money, you need to spend a LOT.   I’m the kind of guy who will spend money on a game if it brings me entertainment or kills time, but this is not one of those games."
1,DocHedges,"I spent a lot of money on this game because it can be addicting and a great way to waste time but ultimately I’m deleting the app. The AI in this game has an advantage over you on every level. The AI can shoot from cover, for example, while you cannot. The AI can even do melee attacks while a short distance from your building, you cannot do the same. Not to mention the AI can spawn many units from the start and has an insane defense while you must work your way up. Don’t bother with this game."
2,Brunugs,"Event play is ridiculous. The computer and user are on 2 different rule sets. Computer unit can stay back behind shelter of base, but the user units are forcibly pushed out. I have drawn 8 purple cards, all the same card out of the 4 possible cards. Have 8 regular decks of cards and see how many times you will draw the same suit 8 times in a row. That is the same probability of .001%. That is just 1 example of how the game rigs the probability."
3,traemonte,"I love the concept of this game and could see myself playing it for hours, but I just hate the progressive cost increase, feels like you’re never actually getting anywhere, even watching ads isn’t doing much. I think if you made it slightly less of a grind it would be a great game, sadly I’m gonna have to delete as of now because of how much time it would consume."
5,hdtijce7,This game is very fun and addicting but it is also quite repetitive. I love the game so far but I wish they had ways to speed up the gameplay with a fast forward button like the 2x speed. Other than that the game is great so far!
3,JamesVB,"Fun game, but too many ads. The ads are all voluntary, but if you don’t watch them, the game progression is too slow to be fun. If you do watch them, the game is over 50% ads. At a minimum, they should allow you to skip after 10 seconds.  Probably won’t play for too much longer because of this."
1,Sorreltail18,"I enjoyed the concept of this game, until I get further into it. It becomes impossibly difficult - causing this game to become unplayable and repetitive. For reference, I have been stuck playing the same level over and over and over again for the last day.   I can appreciate the fact ads are not shoved down your throat- you only watch them if you want those minimal “power ups”.   Ill be shelving this app until an update renders it playable."
4,Anita0119,Im loving the game and everything. Just feel like we need more keys for dungeons or be able to do more things. Maybe like a dungeon where we are able to control are character and enemies are coming from all around. Also feel like there should be higher gem packs for purchasing
4,JerrmiahMassari,"It’s really slow in the beginning, and every time you moved to the next age, you lose everything and have to start over. That’s a little frustrating. But overall it’s pretty strategic and how you play, and there’s no penalties when you lose. So it’s a fun game overall."
4,richardzhou,Sometimes it tries to get you to do something that you don’t want to do like when you get gems it tries to get you to buy cards and I don’t want to buy cards and when I completed a task and I get 1 gem less than I was supposed to
5,"69, 69,69, 424, 24, 20","This is the best game ever you have to get to the end quick if you upgrade from the caveman stage two to the next, get the side people and get the size then us swing shop person then and then just keep going and going and then you’ll win."
1,Plsstopthismadness,For anybody that said the first stage without watching ads any time less than at least 3 weeks is a complete lie. This game is wayyyy too slow. Very much as reliant. And the upgrades cost are ridiculous because you barely get anything from in game without ads. Pls speed the game up a little or give us more coins or make it more possible! There’s a thin line between grinding and wasting ur time.   The game has potential and the art is really nice but you need to fix this game for real!
5,lordtator,"First of all it doesn’t bombard you with advertising and electing to use the advertising for extra content isn’t unbearable..that’s my biggest point with phone games.  Additionally it’s actually just kinda fun, it’s a bit of a grind but it’s not too much to bear. Perfect for a phone game."
3,bass.fit,"Fun game, but they start repeating eras. I feel like there are tons of different kinds of historical eras to use. Just feels a little lazy considering you have to watch so many ads. You can avoid ads, but it slows your progress significantly down. Nice you can completely play it without, but the amount of ads you have to watch is absolutely ridiculous."
3,Jay28822,"The skill cards do not scale well at all. I have plus 150% damage but once I got to timeline 5, the enemy units from the same era do the exact same damage as my units. This needs to be balanced properly, otherwise there is no point of playing this game. I should be getting stronger for each time I summon a skill card + hitting a certain level of power growth as they stack up. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. YOU HAVE A SKELETON FOR A GREAT GAME."
5,MaximaMustard,"This game looks extremely simple, yes. And it may be somewhat time consuming; however, the joy that comes from it reminds me of an old game called Cartoon Wars I used to play all the time. It’s not the same game, no, but the joy I find from playing this kind of 2-D RTS war game can’t be replaced"
5,yay free robux!!!,"Anyone who doesn’t give this game 5 stars can bug off. This game is amazing to play and fun, it helps teach a lesson of hard work will pay off. You gotta just keep going till you reach your goal this game is underrated and needs more people to play!"
2,Eric the Awful,"This game cheats. How?  1. Fighters spawned by the game and by the player should be evenly matched, but they’re not. The game’s fighters are ~15% more effective both on offense and defense.  2. Fighters spawned by players will lose life even if they’re not hit by the game’s fighters, whereas this is not the case for the game’s fighters. I witnessed this just this morning when the biggest guns in the Space Fight gradually lost life for no reason whatsoever.  I guarantee the owners of this game do not care how impossible and frustrating it is to play, as long as you continue to watch the ads that are -practically speaking- VERY NECESSARY for advancing. They’re getting paid; they don’t care about their players.  I’m done. This game is leaving my phone TODAY."
4,SpongeBobSquarePants🧽,"I absolutely love this game, but the are some things that make the game hard to want to play, because the gameplay is fun but the AI always has the upper hand unless you constantly grind, and the upgrading is kinda slow, but other than that I highly recommend"
1,Askeih,"The AI will always have the edge on you. Your production will stay the same, but AI production somehow increases as the round goes on. E.g. as a round progresses, in the span of time it takes for you to create one unit, the AI can produce SEVEN of that same unit and no upgrades ever seem to be enough to overcome that advantage it has. I would call it a broken mechanic, but it’s clearly designed to make the game unwinnable unless you spend money on it. I have no idea how this game got 4 stars. It’s not satisfying at all. Don’t waste your time."
5,Sooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this game so much I started today and I have no regrets. It is the best game I have ever played on my phone so far I do have to admit there are quite a lot of ads if you want to get extra money at the end of the game, but overall just seeing everything really cool"
2,Ioo noobs,"This game has the slowest progression style, pretty much forcing the player to watch ads. If they don’t watch ads, it takes forever to go anywhere. Added issues: every single battle takes ages, along with enemies being too strong to usually kill until you have way too much power, which you will NEED to reset due to the enemies evolving. If the game was more fun, maybe it would get more stars."
1,Coltonpwns,"I love these styles of games. Unfortunately, this one is tarnished with the design to get you to watch adds to x2 your coins. It also restarts your progress (Food Generation and Base Health) every time you advance your civilization  to yet again, get you to watch adds to get more currency. Game does not get ANY harder, it just is a slog. Lots of potential if it did not have the idea to farm money by trying to make money from add revenue. Too bad, maybe next time devs. STAY AWAY if you want to keep your brain cells."
4,The game's biggest fan,"This game is a good game, it just takes I while to level up/upgrade to the next generation thing. No ads except when you want to double your earnings. Fun game but after a while it gets boring. Hope the developers can add an update where we can have more stuff to do on here."
1,Proudline,"This is the most add driven game I’ve played in a while. From jump the enemy camp has 500hp and yours has 2hp. Yeah 2HP! You can spawn 1 troop to your enemies 3 so there’s a no win scenario for a better part of the game. All the “upgrades” are pointless and have no real lasting effect. This is is set up so you have to watch the adds to progress on any serious way. And even then, not so much. I don’t know who is giving this such high reviews cause there isn’t much fun to be had here."
4,Ausssstin,Finally a game that doesn’t force you to watch adds after every interaction. You have the option to watch ads in exchange for rewards but none are forced. In app purchases are kept to a minimum and there are no annoying pop ups.
5,Alar98,I love that this game doesn't require you to watch ads. There is an option to watch them to double rewards and earn currency but there aren't constant ads after every play through. Thanks devs!!
5,TwStR Matt,Nice game to play in your free time. One suggestion I have is maybe a $10 purchase to skip ads forever. You don’t have to watch the ads but it will speed up your progress a lot. Having a $10 no ads purchase would be great!
1,Zack1661,This game is so buggy and janky. If you watch an ad (which you have to do if you plan on getting further than the first timeline) the game will freeze AFTER you watch the ad. Meaning you don’t get the reward for the ad AND you lose your progress you made before the ad. THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME (and not in a good way). Steer clear if you don’t want to get your time scammed away from you.
2,Busuto,"The game is fun for awhile. It eventually gets to a point where it’s impossible to progress without spending money or spending hours on 1 stage watching ad after ad. The meat/unit ratio is terrible in the higher stages and no matter what you do, you can’t generate enough food to make any units to combat the enemy’s 20+ units.   You’ll get a good few hours out of the game but don’t expect it to last before it turns pay to win."
5,Wowboy70,"This game is super fun! I’m only on mid timeline 5, so I’m pretty new, but I’ve been playing this game for 3 days nonstop! One thing I’d really like is a range stat on the individual troops in the info section if possible. There could even be cards to upgrade it!"
4,Jack Hol,Fun game but gets repetitive fast. Some mechanics are a bit frustrating like how you can age up and still get destroyed by the first enemies. Wish it was a bit more fast paced as well. What it needs the most is something like automatic base defenses or spells to make it more interesting. Overall nice little game.
3,WiseRebel518,"Enjoying the game so far. It has its issues but it doesn’t really bother me that much. The only thing that does is one specific ad that always hangs up when it prompts that the reward is given. No matter what I do, I can’t close the ad. I have to restart the game and the progress I would’ve made that round would be lost."
1,Inquisit0rmaster,"Ai has much more power and you cant win because they spawn so many characters when you can barely spawn one. Hours of playing will hardly  get you anywhere. You have to watch ads in order to get anywhere. Some ads are faulty and you have to leave the app and rejoin, which loses your coins that you were doubling or your process in a battle. The game just doesn’t feel progressive and after you waste a bunch of time its hardly rewarding."
5,Heatedchill,"The game is a lot like war of ages on newgrounds! It also has more to it than just that though, as well as having rewarding ads! I recommend it as a time spender when you have free time, because it will consume all of it"
5,Restaurant Enthusiast,"This game reminds me a lot of stick wars, minus the pay wall. A fun way to waste time when you’re bored. It keeps you engaged without spending too many mental resources, the animation is endearing, ads are optional (a huge plus), the unlocks are fun, the perks balanced. Overall, very fun."
4,Happeningcarpets,"I like this game man, it’s pretty challenging but in a way where you’ll definitely get through it eventually. Very fun and easy to play at like 30 seconds a time when you’re at work or something.  Just one thing is please make the pause button actually pause the game 😂"
5,Comment Vigilate,"It is really good, it takes time, and strategic spending to advance quicker and better. I really enjoy your game, I really do. A cool update I thought about was multiplayer. I feel like it would make it way more enjoyable in my opinion. Overall, great game."
4,Averyluvsdoggos,Okay one thing I would like to say about this game is WHY it’s so hard to beat the other side it’s like a ant going up against a giant it’s not fair like we have to upgrade and wait for everything when the npc has 500 lvl base and you have whatever level you upgraded it to its kinda impossible….
4,Gmetalcrash,"The game concept is fun, the problem is the progression become super slow at certain point and the only way to expedite it is watching ads, and even you do you still have to repeat the same action for several fights. It’s not fun anymore at that point."
2,UGtheOG,After playing few weeks i just realized same level and same class warriors not in same power. My warriors seems weaker than opponent warriors. It took me 4 hits to kill them but they killed me with 2 or 3 hits. Spawn rate also favor to opponent. Also rewards not powerful enough to continue playing even after purchase it.  I feel like game cheats and not fun to play after few weeks.
3,choimein,"Great game. No ads, makes the game immediately stand out above most other mobile games.  Everything was fine until I logged on today and lost HOURS of progress.  I watched a lot of ads to get where I was at in the event and lost ALL of the progress. A setback like that makes me not want to pick it up again. Shame"
4,Andrew n Luke,"You can get a lot of currency and watch ads later, it’s cool, and this game is grindy if you don’t like ads but like every game is, it’s how game devs make money. I like it but I really think it would benefit from a different ad system like mentioned above."
5,MuslimArabNokia,"Really fun game but it took me a whole day to  finish the first game, and I hate when u press the X button and it still gives u ads ,and i hate how fast the enemy on the first game gets like 16 club man thats not even possible and fair so fun game but please fix these problems devs"
4,hcnxlala,"Only thing saving this app is you dont force me to watch an ad the ads are grounded in something logical. Game is pretty straight forward good to kill time. Only thing that irritates my soul about this game, how they will push eachother closer to the enemy like a sacrifice..why cant the “warriors” walk around eachother or walk thru eachother"
5,Sitcom prom,"For as simple as this game is, the core game play loop is solid and the over arching concept of the combat is very enjoyable. It’s highly addictive and the best part is that it isn’t riddled with adds, you can use them to your advantage so their being here is a welcome."
5,Jackthe5star,I say this in a good and bad way good bc the game is absolutely amazing but in the add for the game it shows the person licking where they wanted to start so I would maybe change that but overall the game is greatly creative.  Thanks devs for this game
1,Juice_Box0422,"Have always loved these time of games, and this is one of the best by far but the progression for this game is too slow to where I have considered deleting this game. The only way to get a decent progression is to have to watch an add after every game in order to double coins, l would really appreciate the option to remove adds to where we can still double coins without having to go though all the adds."
5,58925301,This really fun and entertaining TOTALLY install it!!! Whenever your bored or something like that just play this game this honestly is one of the best games for me yet it’s great 😃! This is just my opinion but at least try it! I would totally recommend this.
5,Modlawls,"There was a bug for the race rewards. If it wasn’t fixed in 24 hrs with an apology I would give 1 star, but they fixed it and apologized quickly so accordingly I give 5 stars for their integrity and hard work."
3,Nunyabiz6968,The game play is ok. The thing that gets me is that sometimes when you watch a video to get something the game crashes and gets stuck in a buffer screen and you have to close the app out and restart it. That means you gotta start the whole level again and try the video again.
4,calibj12,I love this game but I do have some problems which is why I only rated it a 4 star I don’t like that the other team starts at 500 health and it is very hard to get to but as you get better and better you will soon realize that it gots easier and easier which I love thanks for reading and considering
5,Ed44444444444,Who is the best game ever you should always play this game buy it you should play immediately. I think the strategy get the dinosaur back back rider and then just only use him and stall. The first guy you should get is the Vato guy and then then you only dinosaurs.
5,GalacticUmbreon,"I read the reviews all complaining about how hard it was, it is very hard, and there are ads you can watch to make it easier if you want. However, the game is so fun that I am fine with grinding it. Overall great game!"
2,_lishaGirl_,"This game needs an idle feature.  Doing the same thing over and over to get to the next stage gets boring quickly. There are also some bugs.  When my “warriors” get surrounded by enemies they start to turn around and hit nothing.  The enemies also start to hit my base when there are still enemies in front of it.. If I’m not mistaken the point of the game is to keep your warriors in front of the base so the enemies can’t get to it, but they’re going past them? It makes it impossible to win. My upgrades are also not doing anything.  I’m on level 3 on 2 yet there is no noticeable difference..  Please make the game better, and more simple, so that we can continue to play it.."
4,Stormwing641,"I saw an ad about this game and thought “Ugh. Another fake ad” then saw the game on the App Store and decided “I’ll get it, just for fun” and it’s actually like the ads!! I was surprised! It takes a little bit to get going, but it’s worth it. And from what I’ve seen, the ads to watch are optional"
1,drinkbox04,The new update on the game made everything worse. I was able to pass the dungeons no problem. Now I have to go back several levels to even be able to pass it. What is going on? I had leveled up a lot to be able to get those awards now it’s like taking two steps back. Also why did the daily spin wheel change to 12am? It was perfectly fine at 7pm CST. It feels like I’m missing out on spins since it restarts at 12am.
1,Bad evxh exhveg,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!! Use to be fun like last week but I spent 11$ on it to make it “double speed” forever and it didn’t even do it. It only took my money. On top of that it says “watch ad for more speed” okay cool so you watch the ad then it makes you watch another and won’t give you anything til ya do… game was fun like a month ago then they updated it now it’s garbage and it stole my money, after writing this review I’m calling my bank to get my money back. It’s ridiculous"
4,MusicalGnat,"This game has been a lot of fun. I love the fact that failures bring that closer to success. That being said, starting of a level would occasionally be useful, but every time I click for the ad to obtain it the ad freezes the game."
5,deezy_nutz,"I've had this game for a while, before they spammed tiktok ads. I just wanted to say i love the new update making the strength and health multipliers more accessible and easy to see. Also no forced ads?! Thats sick fr i use the ads strategically tbh"
5,russian crackhead gunsmith,I’ve been playing for half an HOUR and I’m not even won the first battle since you ARE SUPPOSED TO LOSE ON THE FIRST BATTLE MANY TIMES oh yeah wanna know a way to win? WATCHING ADS TO LOSE LESS NEXT TIME. 5 stars would rather eat a raw spider monkey then play again.
5,one ⭐️,"This is honestly such an entertaining game! You have to be okay with loosing at first, and you have to level up to defeat your competitors. Best thing, is there’s no ads! The ads are optional if you want to get more food to start off with. Honestly a great game!"
5,Kierson Eckiwaudah,I love this game it’s fun and I just like the timeline of war they come up with but the thing is every time you upgrade you only get 1 health so early game is difficult so I was thinking maybe 10 hp every upgrade but overall this is a cool game
3,drewmacland,"Often ads don’t load. When that happens you lose everything. Won over 25k hold on one battle, clicked the ad to double it. Ad didn’t load and I lost the gold and the doubling. Ads don’t load in other areas as well, meaning those things are lost also. Still a fun game, but ad heavy and occasionally glitchy."
5,good guy good game,I really like this game because when am going somewhere I play this game and it take my mind off of it and then am there it’s also really fun I think you should get it to and have the same amount of fun as I do playing this game
4,adeloo77,The game overall is really good the progression in it is not fast and not slow so it’s good only problem is when there’s an ad and the ad end’s you can’t press on the “X” button to remove it that’s the only problem it has occurred many times
4,pstone221,"Really fun game to waste time on, but the lack of a no ad option to buy is really rough. Even it was a ticket system or limited gains for having no ads it’d be better than the growth being locked to ads."
5,AlexSisk18,Me and my wife love this game. We play it every night and it’s definitely a conversation starter too. Every time we progress to the next age we always talk about that age in time specifically. I definitely recommend downloading this game!!!!
5,griffin0968,"This isn’t even a paid review like most are, I actually love this game even when the campaign gets hard to grind playing the events are my favorite. Iv been playing games like this for a decade now and this has been my best experience."
1,Willis9409,Just did an event and I was in the top place with the person in second place being 6 ages below me. Theres only 2 hours left in the event. I closed the game to do something for literally less than 10 minutes and now I’m 10th place. How did 9 people pass me in less than 10 minutes? 9 people that were NOT on the leaderboard before? I’m never spending anymore money on this game and now it’s probably getting deleted.
5,I a'int gona tell ya,I say the difficulty (like enemy multiplier stats) shouldn't go up until like a rebirth to timeline 1 again. Also co-op would be nice and the zombies mode gets too difficult as a certain point.
2,ApocaReptex,"Comes off as a fun game but still stands no where close to similar games such as Age of War. I believe it could be great but the meticulous nature of running it down over and over to finally be able to upgrade pushes for pay to win features. The game also doesn’t have many features, is too simplistic for my preference, and doesn’t have much strategy to it."
5,Avocadofrommexico12345601,"This game is so good I can’t stop playing it. It’s fun unless you wanna level up easily. I played this on a car ride expecting to be bored at like 30 minute mark since the reviews,But this game is good I like it and there are different evoloutions and everything."
2,ObleoB,"This game would be fun if the video ads didn’t keep getting stuck where it didn’t end and allow you to go back to the game. 90% of the advertisements never end for several minutes, never give a button or x to end them and go back in game. The amount of advertising needed to play this game is awesome insane, All I doing is watching advertisements."
5,Cmoney573,"this game is one of the best mobile games ever, good for long car rides where u might not get service and it also keeps u interested, my only complaint is that it seems just a bit too slow for me"
4,Update request#1,I enjoy playing this game the only problem is that I reached max on most of the things I can upgrade. I also have a lot of resources that I can’t use since there is nothing to spend the on please update so I’m not stuck at this wall anymore.
2,Unique[]_Username//,"Ad farm. The optimal way to play, by far, is to watch an ad between each run. I’ve never watched so many ads on a mobile game.  Progress is too slow intentionally to maximize time watching ads: currency removal between evolutions, marginal passive skills that make no noticeable difference in battle, no fast forward, etc.  Two stars for the cute designs and initial addictiveness of the game."
5,Quinloki,"As watching is all voluntary, not randomly popping up and if you don’t mind a slow progression (which I find kind of meditative and relaxing) then you don’t have to watch any of them. Nice mindless game with good graphics and a chill vibe."
4,Ilovesolitairemorethanme,"I love the concept of the games progression. I feel that occasionally or in at most 2 rounds, an ad should pop up because one of the goals I need for those green coins is to watch 5 ads yet I do not have the opportunity to watch an ad for it."
5,👁️👄👁️💀👹😬,This Game is really fun and it’s time wasting but it takes forever to get past one level and yea it’s still really fun I love this game there’s basically no adds and I do this game everyday when I’m bored I would suggest this game
2,monneycraft,2 ads a day to get the fast meat isn’t enough. I log on in the morning for those 2 ads just so I can get some meat to make better progress. Even downloaded one of the games before from ads. But there needs to be more then 2. Without them progress halts to a crawl. Also if you pay 11 dollars for 1.5X speed. It shouldn’t speed up the enemies too. Just yourself.
1,cheezey427209,"The farther you get into this game the more it’s going to try to force your hand into buying in game  currency. They said hey our games simple and fun but people aren’t spending enough money so let’s make them have less fun to increase our profits! I’d rather just buy the game and enjoy a more balanced version instead of trying to be persuaded to pay to progress. It’s sad, pathetic, and greedy. Somebody just took the base idea of age of wars and milked it for profits."
5,BulLeT_165,"Yea at first it is kinda boring and “hard” but seems like you gotta try to evolve more than anything, iGot through the first stage or era in about an hour. 8/10 game. If you love age of war then this game feels similar to it. Definitely give it a try"
5,Lol doll gril,At first I thought oh this game probably will just be well stupid but it blew my min away ! I had so much fun playing this game and figuring out strategies to survive. This game was so impeccable and had a great way on how to play. Lastly I was excepting so much ads but there really any! This is just Wow 🤩
5,ivyyy123,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game!      I LOVE THAT there is NO ads unless you request an ad to get something, like more money.        This game is so fun once you’ve gotten used to it.    I downloaded this game YESTERDAY and I already LOVE it!!                        Happy holidays and have a good day!"
2,AND I OOP BECKY,"This game has so much potential to be good. However, level six is way too difficult and unbalanced. You cannot upgrade your food production enough to keep up with the amount of units sent by the enemy, as the cost is far too high. Also, it is never worth it to upgrade base health, so some other more u o que upgrades would be nice. Finally, I keep getting the same two cards for buffs."
5,Minyosksm,It’s a cool game although it would be even better if you guys do a offline and online mode where you can fight vs other players and if you win you get coins as in the battles.
1,Skittless24,"I would watch ads at the end of rounds to double the rewards, however, the ad glitched to where I could never get the reward and would have to close the app to escape the ad screen. When I would get back on the app immediately after, the progress of that run was lost. This has happened several times. I deleted the app because I don’t intend to fall for this ad farm without a reward of some kind."
1,Purple Space Bunny,"Game sold a speed boost that literally said FOREVER. They just took it away with the newest update and gave you 3x coins. Upgrades already gave that, I wanted to be able to get through levels faster. Thanks for just completely removing a feature tons of people paid for; won’t be playing your game anymore, takes too long to get through things and I don’t trust you not to nuke my purchases."
3,Jesserayleach,"At first, the age that you wanted to evolve costed coins. Which they eventually updated to.. once you beat the age that you are on, it would have you evolve not costing coins. Which was great! THEN… they took away the update… Why would you take away a quality of life update?? It doesn’t make sense."
3,western alaska,"The app it like: Ads: 95% The game: 5%  Every match is when you want to double, we will have to stare at the ads for a minute and the 1.5x is kinda slow and in my mind I thought it might be 2x speed and it is only 5 minute long and to activate the 1.5x speed we will have to wait a long time to watch an ad."
1,chik- fa-yeet,"This is probably the most unbalanced game on earth. It starts you off with 2 health while the enemies have 500 health. I understand that it is a game that takes time, but it shouldn't have to take me 5 HOURS TO COMPLETE THE FIRST LEVEL.  Also, it took me roughly) 60 ads to get to that spot. This game is not worth your time and the only reason I'm still playing is because I'm sick and have nothing to do. As soon as I'm not sick, this game is being deleted. That's how bad this game is."
5,HaHaBoiIDK,"I been playing for a couple weeks and here are my thoughts, firstly the start is way too grindy I suggest making it easier for beginners. The game does get better once you get good. Its not bad but not that fun either. The strategies are easy to learn."
5,Cool princetonxp2000,This game is AWESOME THE BEST GAME I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I ENJOY IT …But there is one slight problemmmmmmmm it’s the levels when I’m just chilling and killing easily and it changes enemy’s to a bigger and bigger level plus when I was looking at health the enemy hit 2x harder than my people and it doesn’t make sense pls fix this.
1,()()()()()()()(),"I wrote a lengthy review in extreme detail of how terrible this game was earlier this week, and it never appeared. It's not listed on my account's list of reviews either. I didn't save it anywhere and I'm not rewriting all of it, so all I'll say this time is this game is a pathetic Age of War ripoff that crams thousands of ads down your throat in order to make the game slightly less awful to experience. It's not worth the waste of time. Don't play this, find another game to play."
5,|)/\¥$,"No ads. Not pay to win. Easy to under stand. Fun to play. Always progress no matter what. And whoever says it’s a hard game and super slow progression are wrong, it’s just a skill issue on their part."
5,Form of speach,This game is the best it doesn’t force you to watch ads it is just how the ad says it is it’s the best game u have ever played doesn’t need internet you can play it anywhere I recommend it highly
5,Ironmanmark85,"It is easy to play and fun. Being someone who plays mobile games, this is one of the only good games to play on mobile. Not to many adds about the game or in the game. I also multitask screens, so I play this game. I truly ret"
4,Stale Beer,What a stupid thing to not stack…. If I evolve it resets all health and food income rate it would make a lot more sense to let it stack. But since it doesn’t do this I may as well never evolve until a year of saving money in game and destroy your stupid game with ease. Good job making this so horribly #deleted
3,Thefellawithnoname,It’s a good game just incredibly slow progression. The update created some issues too. My current guys have damage of 12 and theirs has 12.4. That’s fine but my guy has 11.4 health and theirs has 37.2. I literally can kill only one of theirs for the last 9 battles and I’m obviously upgrading everything possible.
5,calm crow,"This is so fun and it doesn’t require internet and not every second there is an ad, it gives you a choice if you want to watch an ad. 100% recommend playing this it’s so relaxing and fun."
5,youngmao,Just downloaded this a couple weeks ago I just started playing. I’m addicted. I’m so happy to have found. It is doing wonders for my mental and physical and cognitive health. Highly recommended super basic a good strategy game to start with.
1,RGRawr,"Most games have quick early progression to lure you in. This game does not. It’s just super slow from the start.  Gameplay is normal for these games. You buy food supply, to spend on units during battles, from gold earned during battles. However, you don’t get very much gold. Maybe after 2-3 battles, you can buy a small upgrade.  Mostly, battles are determined by your supply rate, units types available, and the mix you put them out in. Sounds fun and strategic right? Yeah until you realize your supply rate is insufficient and you’ll need to grind 8-10 more battles to get to a point where you can take the enemy force. And that’s just the first mission.   My third hour playing isn’t that different from my first hour."
2,Keywork33,"Even with all units, several upgrades and 3 buffs from the cards, LV 1 was still unbeatable.   While I understand ads help pay the game, as other reviewers said, LV1 has you so weak that even watching ads for boosts, coin multipliers, and even upgrades do not help. The difficulty is purposely too high to force you to keep watching an ad for extra coins.   Just don’t bother."
2,Mindful420,The game is not boring however I wish you found a better way to make the game feel rewarding to play i do not feel as though im making any progress the summoms is a cool feature however it isnt what I was hoping for how about make new units unlockable through summoning and rather than reseting players gold when they evolve just make the game harder.
1,ElectableDane,"I appreciate not having constant ads pop up and that they’re optional, but absolute slog to get anywhere. Signs were there when you start, requiring multiple failures to even get enough coins to get enough upgrades to just not instantly lose after the first few enemies. Gets repetitive even as you age up, it’s just the same grind with a new coat of paint. Also false advertising is what got me into this."
1,kobe357,This game is nothing more than a compelling add trap. Fun when you initially start but very quickly becomes a repetitive pay to win nonsense game. The game mechanics literally change based on your play style/ “leveling up” technique. It is a game designed to draw people in and then subsequently force them into paying to progress. The “events” are rigged and the embarrassingly simple gameplay is intentionally stalled after about lvl 50. Repetitive. Boring. Lazy. Shady.
1,Dondelavega,I do like this game.   However as a free player I had a much easier time but once I paid for upgrades the game started getting unreasonably hard.   So what happens is the game adjusts.  If you just a free player you will do fine.   The minute you start paying it screws you over.   And I’ve spent HUNDREDs on this game like an idiot.   My advice:  play for free.  Don’t buy a d^%# thing from this game because it will screw you over .
5,Little Toussaint,This game is amazong because the dont force adds on you and you can choose to watch them for additional stuff also i like the gameplay its very fun 10/10 game toatally recommend. No adds!
5,🌭🤣😁👍🏽,It’s a great game can’t believe it gets any hate though the start is hard you slowly get better it takes skill and it doesn’t have many ads unless you choose to watch one great game❤️
1,Thanosdid911,"I've had the game for a few months now, but 2 of the dungeons you can do as one of the features suddenly stopped refreshing the keys you need to do it daily. It apparently just happens to people according to some things i found on reddit. Also, there are 5 (i think) daily tasks that give you these green coins for upgrades, etc, those also stopped refreshing daily for me too. Not worth the download."
2,Adunn86,"This type of game where you have a base and you release units to fight units from the other base, and “evolve” through the ages… this has been done much before. Which is fine, but I find this game very slow compared to games that have many more features and don’t bother you with ads and pay schemes.  But it’s not terrible, so 2 stars."
3,Jordan Mee,"When you get a damage booster, it only works for that round. So if you spend a bunch of time and effort to get a bunch of damage boosters, they don’t add up. Between that, and I don’t like that the soldiers can’t stack on top of each other, so two shoulders from the enemy sidecould take out four on my side if they’re lined up better"
3,Nirchi,"The game is compelling, from its unit design to its upgrade mechanics, but without frequent 30-second ads, progression is at a crawling pace. DEVs, please consider another pay option that includes 2x gold after each round without ads, in addition to 1.5x speed. Many of us would pay."
1,Deathrite,The game cheats very badly. You buy units with food that takes time to make. The computer will pump out 10 max food units in a second. Then pump out 15 more 10 seconds later. I love the idea of this game but the grind to get good production high enough to do anything is insane. And at higher rates you can’t even tell the difference. No ability to upgrade units. Just three base units per age. Huge disappointment. Not worth the space on your device.
5,HAPPY15630,"I love Warriors especially when I got the next evolution! But I think you should make the computer team more equal in power to your team, other than that I think you should download this app❣️"
5,Ckya Blyat The Russian is here,"No required ads, solid gameplay, but can get boring and grindy at times. With how bad many mobile games are now a days it’s a 5 star in comparison but probably a 4 ignoring everything else out there."
2,Jim7531,"This game potential is overshadowed by its frustrating reliance on forced ads for level progression. The constant interruptions disrupt the gaming flow, creating an uneven playing field for those unwilling to endure the intrusive ads. Despite offering engaging gameplay and decent graphics, the relentless ad-driven model detracts from the overall enjoyment. A more balanced approach to monetization is crucial for this game to realize its full potential and cater to a broader audience."
4,frogqueen69,"Pretty fun game overall, but super grindy and the main way to speed up is to watch ads. Rating it 4 because it’s new and so not many features besides the main game, but not 3 stars because it kept me entertained for a few hours."
5,GBrzeska,The game is a bit simple—still fun though—and you can play the entire thing without watching a single ad if you choose to. You have to respect that in a free mobile game like this
4,Kuribō,"The screen is squished and the menu for upgrades is cut off, you can just barely click both upgrades, and can’t scroll down. Other then that good. Just annoying more then anything."
5,Delete Fox,I thought from the adds that it was gonna be one those game ads are totally different from the game but no  this actually exactly like maybe even better!
3,ophelia918,ok so its a good game but its so annoying that the ads just pop up all the time! leas fix also my little brother plays on his tablet and he let me play but ive been playing for 3hrs and ive gotten29 ads! thats soooo many maybe ad were you can upgrade faster and the other side isint so STRONG!thank you for reading this
4,Cärter,"Game is fun minus the time to wait, it gets very long.. if you want any premium features like the 1.5x speed of course it’s 10$ lifetime, the coin payout seems low, I would pay 5$ for the lifetime 1.5x speeds and would pay another 5$ for lifetime of no ADs"
5,Matshjs,"One of the few quality, mobile games that are not P2W. Yes you can watch ads to speed up progress (but I’d say that’s a fair trade off-you only have to watch ads if YOU WANT TO). A nice time waster in the car etc."
5,cat man 123456789,At the beginning it starts off really slow but after you have watched a couple ads as a boost it sends you to complete cool things so I would definitely recommend.
4,best best best boog,I like the game but is very slow I suggest for more help like tips because I did not even know that you was supposed to evolve or maybe that’s my fault but please make the pacing more fast. I will keep playing this game because it makes me happy make good updates and yup
5,Spiderbrendan,"This game is so fun, it is entertaining and hooks me on for hours. It has no unprompted ads and is a fun relaxed game to play anytime. It is so rewarding to level up, and I have spent more hours on this game than any other mobile game."
1,SkiggyButtons,"This game is as repetitive and money hungry as you could imagine. There is little to no actual gameplay, mostly just sitting around waiting for resources to gather. Once you finally level up, you do the same thing all over again. There are much better incremental clickers out there. This is not it, and their reviews must be fake with the number of 5 stars. Your time is worth more than this crap."
3,Gogogogogogogogogogog,"I’m more of a fast progressing style player and this game only lets you progress quicker by watching ads. The nice is that the ads are optional, however, it’s annoying doing the same thing over and over again just to get a .1 damage upgrade in 10 mins."
5,Blazesauce,"I don’t enjoy mobile games, but I decided to get this game when I saw my friend playing. Like I said I don’t enjoy most mobile games, but this is the best mobile game I have ever played. (I have played it nonstop for 3 weeks.)"
5,ElderLitchKing98,"I came into this game thinking it was another boring waste of time type of game. But after 1 hour of downloading it, I was hooked. Sounds like a BOT review but it’s not. This game feels rewarding after you upgrade to the farm settlers"
3,MAD FREAKING ???CREATURE,Progress is slow unless you watch ads. You should be able to progress with skill or grinding. Otherwise you would have to wait for days to grind the daily challenges for cards that of your lucky you won’t even progress overall it’s a Ight game.
4,Squirrelking1000,Can you please make the game consistent because it’s really annoying doing the same exact thing five times in a row and having a complete different outcome every single time. It makes me not like your game but otherwise it’s fantastic!
4,JJ's den,This review really stands up its name like 100 or 50 I could understand but 500 no just no every round you complete starting at 50 it goes up by 25 I have a feeling my next battles probably gonna be like 1000 or something. Please fix this.
5,TSI KING,"I love this game, but I feel when you level up your figures are not the ones leveling up but the cpu, developers please take a look into this, I noticed more demages is being taking out on my warrios than the CPU"
2,Haftard,"It’s the same level evey time. A few basic, a few ranged, followed by a big wave of basic with a big wave of the level 3 troops.  The card system dosnt work. My ranger units would hit a target twice leaving it with minimal heath and with a 25%damage buff from the cards I see no change.  The enemy ranger units will almost always engag first.  No point in building your base cuz it only takes a few hits anyways"
5,Idkidkdidkkdd,"This game is pretty fun and all but it takes way to much time just to get little progress made, and almost 90% of the time you lose because the AI floods out units. Would only suggest if you have a lot of free time"
4,my insta is im_matthewjarel,The game is pretty good ngl ads aren't forced on you which is great and you can definitely play without watching any ads but the progression is pretty slow ads greatly speed it up. So good game just wish the progression was a little faster.
5,DcDAB123,"Honestly, it’s a fun game a little slow paste. If that’s your kind of thing, go for it it’s my kind of thing, so I love it overtime you upgrade your stuff you get money as you fight the enemies come in waves. It’s pretty fun try it out."
3,Gigi the gamer,I feel like it’s almost impossible and AI has everything when we just started the level. Why is this sooooo hard?plz just make it easier I’m always losing.. I only won 4 times. But this game is very entertaining and fun but I barely win and get money when I win.
5,hitprint,"I absolutely love that this game doesn’t force ads on you.   I spend way too much time on it but that’s my fault!  Super creative items and scenarios. Keep up the fun work, team!"
1,Detritus22,The ads never let you go on. It goes to a black screen the never goes away.  Also I did not accept their agreement.  It let me go on. Let's hope that they understand I do not accept the agreement and that my info and device are off limits. It feels like they might just be dishonest and will still do what ever even though I said nope. So it's getting uninstalled.
5,Cdtzer0,This game is one of my favorite games of all time first I thought this was a stupid money grab but know I can fell the the developers actual care about the game and it feels like a fresh game highly recommended
5,guest94975,At first it it really boring but once you put 10 20 minutes in it’s really fun and please give it a chance and no I’m not bribed or an review bot I do really see potential in this game there’s no forced ad
2,mattalliii,"But it’s ruined by greed.  Then enemy teams AI knows how to have all units lock into 1 enemy,  how ever your team spreads out damage which is far less effective.  It’s like they do this on purpose to make the game harder,  so that the only way you can have an even playing field is by spending money on cards to brute force your way through.      Not a good game with the greed tactics"
2,702Golfer,I really like this game but the grind is real! They let you play for free but it’s sooooooo slow. If you want to speed up the grind you have to watch ad after ad after ad or pay money. Now they say you can play side games but they only give you two free keys per day! This game is actually really fun but very frustrating if you don’t want to spend money.
5,lol im gamer,"The ads are a little too frequent, but otherwise it’s great. Another thing is that you should keep your upgrades when aging up."
4,ASizzle21,I really love this game but I am encountering a bug where the only skill I get with evolution points is the freeze skill. No matter how many packs I open it is the only one I can get. I would give 5 stars if the bug gets fixed.
5,KingSlopp,"I beg you, make an option to pay to permanently remove Ads. You have an option to permanently have 1.5 speed. Why not do the same for Ads?"
5,among us lover the second,"I like how you have to get muns to get better gear and be able to overcome the enemy eventually! It’s a pretty nice concept. It is a lil’ repetitive, but it’s fine. It’s only skill based when you get a second guy, still fun either way tho :D"
4,Billywang1301,"30% of the time when i watch an ad I won’t get my reward even after watching the ad, this is ridiculous because I won’t even get the reward that i would’ve gotten without watching the ad"
4,bbbbbbbbmbmbmbmbm,I was surprised when I saw there was no ads In less you watched one to get food but it takes so long to progress through the first round but overall it’s a pretty good game and I recommend it for people who love battling sims.
5,da god of puppys,It’s free and super fun it’s challenging but fun no Wi-Fi needed it had me up till 3 am everything saves and worth your time it takes a long time to beat the game so it fun for a long long time
5,South Park Game,This is so fun it’s kind of challenging and it takes a little bit too long but it takes a lot but it gets fun. It’s actually very nice I recommend to play this game but I always put I’ll recommend.
3,HEROBRINE mod,"I can’t take it. I spent ALL DAY trying to get 1000 green coins. And just a few hours later I end up with 200. Because the rwards are so low. All day was spent with me trying to keep me place in the score board, but that wasn’t good enough, my sanity is slipping , AND A LONG DAYS WORK MEANS I DESERVE A BETTER REWARD!!! FIX THIS"
1,Kesen21,"Between the extremely overpriced micro transactions that are there just to make the game playable and the constant progress reset, this game is just disappointing. It could be fun but it’s obvious it was just made to get you to watch an ad here and there and throw a few dollars at it to save 10 minutes. It’s just more of the same greed most games have now. Just download Age of War and thank me later."
1,OUTLAWMARK5MAN,No information put out on an eta for the dailies refresh issue to be fixed. When asked about compensation apparently that will not be done so those that are affected by the issue are left to fall behind from no fault of their own. I initially had mixed feelings about this game due to the ad-heavy progression (yes they are not forced but they are required for any meaningful progress) but this truly cemented my position on the game.
4,Jonahplayz9062,"I like the game because of its fast paced battles, the ages, and the diversity of the game.. BUT I think that this game has a lot of improvement space like adding more features like a starting meat button where you can manage how much meat you start with and more troops. BUT I love the game"
5,asain boi( chong. ho,"I beat the first level with only mace guy, and long enough after defeat I did it, my goal, to beat the first level with the first guy. Overall great game experience would do it again"
2,GrandOpener,"There’s the core of an interesting game here.  However, if you play for more than a couple days, you’ll quickly come to realize that the majority of meaningful progression is gated behind either paying real money or watching ads. One of the daily quests is literally just “watch an ad.”  They don’t even try to dress it up."
5,heisbghaknsbdjs,"absolutely love this game, super cute, super minimalistic, and the best part is barelt any ads :D unless you want to gain an upperhand in the game very quickly then yu can watch some but there are no ads anywhere where yu can see them if yu dont want them, love love love it :D"
3,superwow54328,I would give this game 5 stars if there weren’t so many freaking ads. The game is unplayable because of the ads. I’d be happy to play the game if there were ads every third or fourth game. I’ll delete this game now. Maybe try it again if they stop being greedy.
5,Good reviewer09101,I love this game i have been playing for a while now and it’s amazing. There are barely any adds and i love that because most games have an add every second. If you want to have an amazing time download this game
5,Loading information…..,"The game overall is the best. It’s a relaxing game that you have to use strategy but ever since the race even ended for me like 2 weeks ago, I’ve never got any other event at all."
4,A Big Ogre,The game has a lot more depth than you would see at surface value and I genuinely have a lot of fun on it. But it is unreal ad heavy. I would much rather have a 5$ one time but for faster games and daily food boxes. Overall if you don’t mind some grinding the game is surprisingly fun
5,dino13253,"Could use some changes like using there ads to convince people to download it need to be TRUE but overall I liked it’s fun, exciting and fighting figuring strategies to win the enemy a cool concept I recommend to check it out."
1,Avoid Rheem,"The developers are greedy, causing users to waste more time watching ads than in actual game play.  To progress, you play a 20 second round, only to be forced to watch a 30 seconds add.  Without the ads, there's no way to progress.  Worse, you must watch an ad every 5 minutes simply to speed the game speed, otherwise game play moves in slow motion.  Don't waste your time with this mess.  DELETE!!!!"
5,Arabella 🧚🏽‍♀️✨,I really enjoy playing this game and love the style. The only thing I would change about this is the levels I think it needs more. Other than that I recommend this game fully. 👍
1,Number,"They changed the rune tree, took away things I had unlocked, auto-applied them to other things and want to charge me gems to reset my progress on them.  They also doubled the price of all gems in the store and in general just made the game a lot more grinder. I guess people were progressing too quickly.   No thanks, I was watching ads and spending money but this update was a big middle finger to early adopters."
4,Bigdave1722,"We need to have a remove the ads option, I always buy that, when that option is available on games. That is my go to thing to buy."
5,shettevy gahulooni,Like the aspect that every rerun is unique and not just back to the beginning. Really lean into that in future updates create new units and new ages that are different and may require different strategies to use them.
5,Zac115tv,this game is simple and reminds me of classic games I used to play when addicting games was at still alive.   if you want a simple base builder that isn’t just a clash of clans rip off. this is the game for you.
4,Gcosca92,"This game is fun and you dont HAVE to watch ads. However, there are benefits if you do but they work 1 out of 4 times so there is not point. Hopefully their devs read this and fix that! If that was working I’d give it a 5 star"
5,larvae99999,At first this game seems kinda meh but wait until you get a few upgrades and you start rocking and rolling. The only thing I wish they did was add more coins but hey they might be working on that. Otherwise very fun.
4,jackguygameing,"The scroll detection won’t work in upgrades or other parts of the Home Screen,Adds occur frequently after a couple attempts of failing or winning there is repetition on how often hey show up"
1,Aero@2,You charged me twice for an event thing and the only reason I even bought it again was because the darn app messed up and took what I bought off my game! The extra boosts weren’t on their so I had to buy it again and it charged me $50 in total!!!! I did not want to buy the same boosts again I should have been able to buy it once and use it for the rest of the event time! Jerks!!
5,Alliekat816,this has optional adds instead of forcing you like other mobile games and a lot of games are pure brainrot or trash this actually has effort put in this
4,GunnarDrummer,Really amazing afk playing game lol…also the rewards they give you for like 45 sec ads is amazing! I’ve already downloaded Royal Match because of this game. On every ad they give you the chance to play which is amazing!
5,Lizslmbms,"The game is very entertaining, but i believe that the reproduction should be faster. This game is also very nice bascule it doesn’t force any adds you choose to get adds! Definitely one of my favs"
2,Ziganator7777777,"This is very similar to the old Age of War flash game in concept, and it seems to have a level of strategy involved very early on.   It also seems to be much shorter of a game until you finish and realize it resets in a new world a bit harder, but that’s where the brainless monotony comes in.  All strategy is lost and eventually you cannot progress without watching a ton of ads… It’s pretty ridiculous because the game seems to have a lot going for it if it was maybe designed to be enjoyed as a strategy game instead of to be addicted to and to generate ad revenue… it’s a let down.   But it’s a modern mobile game. What can you expect?"
5,Lothinecs,"I beat the Candyland event, except for I didn’t let me get the all tasks completed even though I completed all the tasks if you guys look into that, that would be awesome"
5,this brodcast is made by a kid,This game is really really good it just takes a little bit to start progressing because the more enemies you kill the harder it is to fight them because then they start spawning harder enemies really good game!
2,Dawggy3848593,"Great little grind game if u have patience. But…  Just another decent little game where devs got too greedy. Last update cut in half purchase power.  Was looking forward to buying more stuff when I got my retirement pay on the 1st, but won’t ever make a purchase again due to simple greed. Good luck with the game, I look forward to updates, but u lost my support forever."
5,love the game AND YOUR MOM LOL,So I am new to the game and my thought is to make the first battle just cavemen and add throwers and Dinos later so new players don’t get stressed out because the first battle feels impossible
5,Thefabled1,"I’m obsessed with the game, can’t get enough, but the speed boost only being 5 minutes kills me especially when there’s nothing you can buy to skip ads"
5,Anthrax Wilson,Five stars just for being able to play the game without an ad popping up after every other level.
4,Connor crezee,"Looks like the random skill unlock feature is bugged right now. I have only ever received one skill when rolling for these, so no I have 1 spell slot with level 7 freeze, and a second empty spell slot since I never got another."
2,Eric Sak,Same formula each time. Went to timewarp 6.  AI becomes so OP by that point you need to spend money to have a chance after you have already invested hours into the game with most of that being ads that make them money anyway.  Realized that I was just wasting life at the end of the day and this game ultimately will make you spend money.  So I deleted.
5,HoaxNegative,"Plays like in the ads, progression is slow without watching ads but they are all optional it seems like none are forced. Cute little game"
5,The best game number 1!!!,It’s really good I like the graphics and I just wish there was more health at the beginning of the game that’s all but the rest of the game was amazing I will be your number 1 fan so just letting you know!
5,ᥴꫝꪖ𝘳ꪶ𝓲ꫀ,People are saying that the first battle took them months and weeks when it took me like 30 mins. It’s a really fun game and I totally recommend it for a nice off line game!
5,Matthew262,This is great!  I hope you will incorporate some type of leader board or battle other players mode in future updates.  That would keep me motivated to keep grinding.(as long as it maintains the simplicity) Good job! Don't ruin it!
5,nicky205,This is one of the best games you can play with no ads every other game that you want to try and says no ads it has ads this game has none what so ever and I loved every second of it
5,tuff howard,It keeps going back to Home Screen every time I open it around after 7 seconds this game seems really fun but it won’t let me play
5,MitchellA18,My only concern is that when you try to spawn multiple guys they get stuck on each other. They need to spawn above each other so they're not stuck
1,GalaCeir,"Really fun game, doesn’t force ads. Pay to win is increasing though. Weekly community rank is the same top level, pay to win players, so no hope for anyone else. Seriously race starts and when first hour 30 guys are already on timeline 40.  But most of all after the last update, the game will crash after if loading In, you can’t even play if at the moment"
3,DADnRN,"Game has amazing potential if the developers re-work the progression ads. If you don’t watch any ads then you will hardly progress and you’ll end up deleting it pretty quick. Sadly, this is how all almost-good games are nowadays in the App Store."
4,preisjus,"I gave it 4 stars bc I like the game and I’m not being forced to watch Ads, however, it is a slow paced game and it takes too long to level up and shorten the time it takes to gain enough currency to buy more troops."
5,hi Yusuf dgcn gg go,"Cool game, can be frustrating and repetitive at times but there's no forced adds and you don't need them to progress, been playing for about 2 months now"
2,EveryNicknameIsTaken2211,"This is the closest thing I’ve found that’s similar to age of war, which was an awesome game.   Though this one has no where near as many features, and with how slow the progression is, they’re begging for your money.   I can watch ads, sure, but the only useful ads are available no more than 3 times for the whole day."
5,Destroytheey,"Although you do have to watch a few ads until you e evolve the first time, after that, it gets super easy"
5,Oo tg,I was shocked from this game is I mean it had me playing this game until 12 and I started at seven and as soon as I wake up I play and it is just so addicting in front to beat them and it’s got me so happy
5,Legend rune grinder,"Please make it so the police can actually stand a chance against the gangsters, it’s impossible to beat with having 3 spells and you need the meteorite to get it exactly where you want it or you loose."
5,MrKing Chapman,"There’s a glitch that doesn’t always work, but sometimes. Sometimes, I’ll watch an ad and I’ll instantly close the game. I can get back on, and I’ll have the  x2   coins or whatever I wanted."
4,Manager beans,This is a great game to pass the time. It’s not an idle game. It doesn’t force you to watch ads but your experience is greater if you get the bonuses from the ads. I would gladly buy a no ads micro transaction if it were available
4,a172092,"If you can go into some sort of AFK mode, that would make the game a lot better but overall, I think this is an amazing game and thankful for the creators and I believe I’ll be continuing to play it"
3,Aceboompoom,"Love the game but the ads make it almost unplayable. Finished a game and opted in to doubling my reward but the ad was in an infinite loop, it wasn’t until the ad replayed 11 times when i decided to close the app and start it over only to find i did’t receive any of my rewards not even the initial reward."
5,S.E.Palmeiras,"This game is awesome!! Simple and fun, it doesn’t push ads down your throat, it says what you’ll get if you want to watch an ad to progress faster.  Thanks for bringing the daily missions back!"
1,Austenius,"When you make an in app purchase for a permanent game mechanic, you do so with the mindset that IT IS PERMANENT. Removing the speed boost from the game and not issuing refunds is borderline criminal. This game had potential but the incompetence of the developers is insurmountable. They can hardly put out a patch that’s not completely game breaking, and they remove paid mechanics from the game. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one."
5,Tots honist,You can choose to watch adds it’s super long so it’s perfect for a long trip and it’s free.                                                                                                              I don’t even know how they make money like it’s free no adds
1,Rebaile,"I usually love this kind of games but it is very very slow to progress, because it is very very slow to gain coins the normal way (ie playing…) that it’s totally discouraging. I do not mind grinding games, but not when it feels you’re doing it for nothing. Maybe you should consider tripling or more the initial amount of coins, or giving more than a 0.2 increase for each tap that takes ages to reach."
3,Csmason266,Where are new modes/new ways to play? Constant events are cool but it gets to a point where you either need to spend money or grind ads… probably won’t spend another dime going forward until true new content hits the game.
2,gtufik,The game is designed to compel you to watch ads repeatedly. Ads enable so much progression that the game’s worth playing without watching ads. I uninstalled after it required you to watch an ad every 5 mins if you want to increase the gameplay speed. Very frustrating. Could’ve been fun otherwise.
5,Melanie Mar fan,I love this game it’s amazing I always wanted a game like this but I’m to lazy to write all of this so the point of this review is it’s an amazing game and simple and you should try it it’s great for when your on a car trip it can help to pass time👍
5,E E E E E E E E e ],"This is the first ever review of Rotan in eight years because I really never found a game that was worth writing a review for but this game is really fun. Trust me you’ll love it. It’s a good an amazing game for long car rides or when you’re bored, trust me, you’ll love it."
1,fjdheksjd,The game is simple enough and fun but the mechanics need so much work and he conscription times change up and down and automatically slow down when the game knows you can win the hp for the computer bots change and your hp is set automatically lower then the computer so even if your strategy is correct somehow you still loose cause your troops are some how weaker then their counterparts
3,hudhdjdhdkdjdudvhdhdhdgd,Unlike other games it doesn’t spawn ads every second but you need to watch ads to make a lot of progress but also progression is way to slow even with ads overall it’s still a good game
4,Jgcjhgcjhfcjhcgnhg,"I like the game, it’s fun and simple, one thing that I don’t like is how ranged characters can camp in spawn basically and be immune to damage while picking off all my units, just to then release like 5 tier 3 units all at one to screw me over, just feels kinda cheap to me."
3,kierra22404,You literally need ads after every level (for double coins) to make any type of semi consistent progress or else you’re just playing the same level over and over trying to stack enough money to level up
5,I don't know 369,"It a good game to waste time but I don't know what I did,I don't know if it's just me but ever since I did one update it throws me out every 4 seconds I log in. But over all the game is really good"
1,Whoknewbab,This game is relatively fun until it gets so hard that it’s just not worth playing anymore. Used to delete the game and restart from the beginning but now it forces you to keep the place where you’re at even if you reload the game. So now I’m just gonna say goodbye not anymore.   I wouldn’t recommend it
1,Alg psycho cake,"I’ve been playing this game for over a year and honestly I’m fed up with the cheater accounts. I can’t win any events and it’s all because of cheaters and time loop glitch.   If you want anymore of my money, you better make this game unplayable in offline mode. Cheaters are out of control and I need you to fix this or I may be forced to open a lawsuit.   You have been made aware of your failures. Now fix them ASAP!!"
3,Gibberooster,Nothing says quality game like declining to watch an ad for double coins only to have to watch an ad anyway. Now I get to watch an ad and not get the “benefit” of watching an ad.  It’s a good casual game to play it just would be better if you weren’t interrupted every two minutes.
1,section700,"Every time I get a high score on a level, it freezes. Just sits there with the circle in the middle of the screen. I’ve left it for up to 30 mins to see if it ever goes through. It’s so frustrating to get the timing right and then lose what you’ve earned because it freezes. Doesn’t matter on wifi or not, I have the fastest wifi on Earth so don’t tell me about my connection."
3,MinhNguyen245,"the game tries so hard to force people to purchase stuff. At first the game feel kinda fun but then as I tries to progress more, nothing really sastify me and the game progressing too slow to the point I have to delete this game because it didn't feel fun anymore."
1,Tebbs31,I hate games that force you to watch ads to progress reasonably. The fact there is not a No Ads purchase option ticks me off even more. Not to mention the unreasonably high amount you have to spend to speed up the game.   Look… This game isn’t even close to being good enough to ask that much for an in game perm boost that is that crappy… Just don’t bother guys…
2,Knack99!,"You can progress relatively quickly with the addition of an ad every 2 minutes. Once you get far enough even the ads don’t help. Eventually your warriors won’t be evenly matched, the AI will have more damage/health so your cards become a game of catching up to the enemy. Was fun at first and now it’s just frustrating and unfair."
2,Averycoolperson,"Could come up with a lot more varied, interesting, unique units. Same game over and over and over again.  Airplanes/ flying vehicles that go back and forth across the screen. Fast shooting units. AOE units. Almost complete tanks with little damage. Etc etc etc. I’m not playing this over and over and over again. 🤦‍♂️ smh"
5,Best player_fr,I love this game it’s extremely fun and there are no forced ads. i do think that it would be really good if there was a sandbox mode where you can test battles( just like in the ads on tic tok)
5,JMK428,I love it so much and I want to play it so much too much it is simple you play it and love it and I hope you enjoy it so that I can see other reviews on this game
5,Maxamillon1,"This game has basically no ads unless you choose to watch an ad for a reward, and it’s very good to grind if your into that kinda game so if you just want a game to grind for a while this is the game for you"
1,Howdydoer,"Seriously, this “game” seems like it was purposely designed to see just how gullible the consumer base is. No foreplay at all. You can’t advance even the smallest amount without watching ads or purchasing upgrades. Designers show no interest at all to make this “game” interesting or challenging.  Designed to provide revenue for the producers without offering a singular tidbit of entertainment in return. No effort even made to hook you in."
5,tịnhed,"I really love the modern and gameplay, but somehow it just simple and need to watch Ads. Overall, gameplay still relaxing and I can watch ads when I’m doing works."
5,Xander Healy,"Exactly the game that was advertised, you only have to watch ads if you want to, and you can completely avoid micro transactions by just grinding."
5,Team Haze,Would be a great game if you can just pay a one time fee to skip all ads and gain the bonus rewards
2,Honez2323,"Good game. Really a olympian grind unless you watch ads. If the rewards were better I wouldn’t have deleted it after a day. After trying to play the first event and putting in several hours and not even being able to finish the first round even with watching many ads, I decided to delete the app."
1,Local.Wizard,"Game gives you the option for an ad for double profits or no thanks, and if you click no ad you get one anyways.    Ads are annoying 3-4 part ads where you watch a video and click x, play an ad game and then click 8, with store pops to download it after each x click.  Avoid this game at all costs, read their ad policy’s and tracking info.  Scary stuff."
4,Lincoln c b,So when you get the meat you get a lot in the first round but it feels like they get stronger and you can’t win and it’s not fairly. I just got timeline too and I’m getting wrecked immediately and I have fast meat product and it’s just not fair. Kinda.
5,TinightsPlans,"This game is fun and actually fun to enjoy this is the only game that has not lied about their adds, thank you for creating this game I was so bored and had nothing to do until I found this in insta"
1,Shi game#2,Sometimes events won’t show up and it’s the main way to progress once you get to timeline 6 and I’ve written the game multiple of times and they do nothing about this I recommend the game but only until you get to timeline 6 after that I recommend you find something else to play because there service or updates to this game do nothing
5,Jeffery biden,"I love how the ads are optional to have fun, this is also amazing for long car rides, gameplay starts off slow and gets faster gradually, I recommend"
2,BadassMoefoe,"This game was fun for a little while. Helps kill time. But once you get to a certain point, it just starts to repeat itself, and it gets boring really fast after that and to pass the game you actually have to watch a lot of ads. Especially if you want to get through the levels quickly."
5,Pug………………..10008989088,It is super fun there are tons of levels for you to try and beat. It gets harder and harder as you go on but you get more hooked to the game. I find this game really fun and you should totally get it!
5,Preztel 💯,This is such a fun game there are ads but only if you choose to watch them for benefits. So simple and easy to play. Once you start upgrading this game is AMAZING! I would rate this game ten stars but that is not an option 😂  IRECOMMEND!
4,WherezRonda,This game isn’t dependent on ads nor do they get in the way like other games. This can be 100% free to play. With that being said I’d pay a few bucks to skip ads and still get the rewards 😁
2,"C'mon really...,","Making coins in game is too slow, there needs to Be and offline coin generator also. You literally play a round then watch a 30-60second ad. Over and over again. Every minute you’re literally watching an ad or 2. Unless you pay, but then you’d still be watching ad after ad."
5,bigbottybruhtower,I couldn’t beat the first stage a few weeks ago. Now I can beat every level. Except the last one. I’m on modern age and beat modern battle. And I’m on the space battle and can’t defeat i
4,1 awesome 1,"I LOVE how this game doesn’t shove ads in your face even if you don’t want them to. You could actually 100% the game without ever seeing a single ad! Also, the game is challenging, as you’re placed in an unfair scenario and you have to strategize how to win."
5,Roccocito,"This game is a simulator type game that kills a lot of time. A great part of it is no ads unless you choose to watch them. While it is repetitive sometimes, it’s still a great game."
1,AprlnV,"Literally in order to many ANY progression in this game you either have to shell out money for gems to use for a card system that makes absolutely 0 sense or watch ads, other than that unless you have HOURS to burn, grinding out leveling up your characters will be the only way to play and it will take you FOREVER, just stay away from this game until they make some changes"
3,Spookasoar,"I like the art, it’s cute. But come on… you could really make the upgrades go a little faster rather than a tiny .01 second 😒 it would be so much more fun, but I’m not going to do a million battles just to have a slim chance of surviving more than 10 seconds. No one has time for that."
4,Mr.Pitilio,Really good game it follows timelines through history and has you beat teams through the ages although in the upgrade menu it doesn’t let you scroll all the way down at least for the iPad
3,Disappointed in you,"I like the game, I just wish the difficulty of the events was more reasonable. I’ve tried numerous times and can’t get very far since the enemy units tend to one hit many of my guys. I’ve gotten to timeline 10 on the main game but the events are just too difficult to be enjoyed"
2,Krohnus,It’s a fairly standard game with a lot of ads. some of the ad click throughs are broken so then you’re in an infinite ad loop.   Gameplay is standard. Unit types don’t have a lot of variance or creativity to make any real strategy. Just spawn as many as you can of the best units you have. Die. Watch an ad to get more money. Upgrade and play again.
5,water dale,This game does ads right. Doesn’t force them on you and only offers them for a benefit. Should be the model for every mobile game
2,Bob27291,"As you start the game introduces you to cards, a very important mechanic. As you progress, go further into timelines, you have very little passive boosts against your enemy. Thus making it somewhat hard to complete the battles. You must watch many ads or pay lots of money to even get good. Even then the enemies will still get harder."
1,Nerdinstincts,If you want a game that grabs you from the start and makes you want to play it - this is NOT it.   If you want to spend several hours in futility watching your tiny little cavemen not make it past 30 seconds and get trampled by cavalry on repeat for several hours until you get enough coin to do something about it…this may be the game for you.
4,Иovykov,The game is kind of annoying in the beginning because you can’t win. After upgrading well the game becomes more interesting and you have to use more strategy to win. Very well made game. Супер игра!
5,Shawnwilliamsn,Love the method of marketing which is advertisjng but instead of forcing it they make it to where if u want faster progress then u watch ads which isnt that bad tbh its still very enjoyable.
2,Rusted Coconut,"If you don’t want to spend hours getting clapped, you’re obliged to watch ads. You’ll spend more than half your time in this app watching ads. First level is terribly unbalanced as your first 20 games are spent painfully waiting to spawn your first 5 units. Every new timeline has the same opponent spawning pattern but with new skins."
4,Griffon Butler,"It’s annoying that once you play through the first timeline it feels like the same thing over and over just reskinned. Seriously has potential, thanks for the fun gameplay!"
2,Nblomgren23,It’s a fun game but leveling up is incredibly slow and there is no easy levels not even when u start out… it’s very frustrating to say the least. the enemy has a crazy advantage until you level up drastically which takes a long time. i mean if you wanna watch an ad everytime you get money then be my guest.
5,Jaccer,"Finally an app that is exactly like the ad I saw for it. It’s free, offers some upgrades if you watch ads within the app, doesn’t require any purchases. Like it!"
2,idijqnndmkawuduhw,"Basically a repetitive game where you need to either pay money, or watch countless ads, or both to make any progress.  Fun for an hour, but after that do yourself a favor and delete it as it doesn’t go anywhere, it just repeats again and again and again"
5,math the you,Ok so first of all the game has to be the best game that is not online and not only that but their is no ads that the game forces you to watch. At first the game seems really hard but it's fun its all about strategy and evolution.
5,Gguard,I got this game from one of those stupids ads for some other game. I started playing it for 4 hours. It’s a really simple looking 80’s style game. It’s easy to play and a lot of fun.
5,allthisshitstaken,"I know you have seen seen this game on tiktok and to keep it short yeah the reviews are true. Good progress curve, no ads unless you want them (and you don’t need them to progress)."
1,BusCommuter3,"Fun to play, but UX isn’t ideal. Each time I open the game I now get a popup for the current event (which is a constant loading screen, because I don’t give the application access to the internet), and another popup to log in / connect to an Apple identity. And this happens every single time I open the application. Let the user determine if they want to look at these, constant harassment isn’t a good experience."
4,TheRealGenghis,"Why isn't there an options to pay for completely removing ads? Grinding is not an issue(very grindy game btw), but ad watching is the worse. $12 bucks just to speed up the game .5x? Really?   Why are you guys money whoring?"
5,Strawbre57,At first it took a LONG time to beat the first few battles but now I’m great at it but there is more than a few ads but overall it’s really fun.
2,QuackDaddy,"No way this game is over three stars.  You have to lose 30 times in a row before you can “upgrade” enough to beat level one.  This is not a skill thing. You are simple out gunned for the first 20+ upgrades.  Ridiculous. Not exactly a way to get people into your game.  FINALLY beat the first level. Do you get to dominate and stack up some points? Nope.  On to the next level where you are forced to lose 20+ times in a row until it’s an even match up.  Deleted within one hour of downloading.  “Would not recommend.” Hahahaha! Seriously, do t waste your time."
2,Broke_Geologist,"This game has a fun premise, but good lord is the progression slow. Every increasing upgrade costs for an increase of .02 to your resource/second rate. Half the time the ad doesn’t give you your reward because the game freezes after watching it. It could be good, but right now it’s just frustrating."
5,Killian Gillen,I just 🏆 won at level one and then I started sending this review and it’s so nice but there is some issue every time I win the opponent upgrades his base and that is something
5,"M,..,,j,",This is the best game but u must have patients it takes my mind off things when I’m stressed and you must never give up just keep upgrading your meat speed
5,KingCls12,"This is a really good grindy game if you have a lot of time on your hands. Yes their are ads, but they don’t randomly pop up in you face. You can choose to use them or not for progression."
5,Curt D Lane,Unlike most games we are warriors only shows add when you want to which I think makes the game better
3,Samuel51401,When you watch an add for a speed boost or extra 100 coins the ad for the monkey king gets stuck at the end and doesn’t let me close out of it after the ad ended therefore having me to watch more ads because the app shorted out
4,Eddie Friend,The play is simple and somewhat addicting. However a bunch of times after watching adds to double my reward the game freezes and I loose what I won. I must have lost millions of orbs because of this.
1,thehandofchurchill,"so.. many … ads…. Just another fun little game that has you watching ads in equal parts to playing the game. It’s fun yes, but the entire game is just an ad engine. Beat a level.. watch an ad.. want to speed up your food production so you have a prayer of actually winning? .. watch an ad.. that buff runs out in a few minutes and guess what ??? Watch another ad to re-up.."
2,CheeksAkimbo,"Wasted 30 minutes on a very slow game. The game starts out very slow and remains very slow. Progression isn’t very good. All though they don’t bombard you with ads, progression relies on viewing ads otherwise you’re slowing inching your progress to evolve which only resets your progress and you start out slow once again."
3,Lepcron,"I’m on timeline 15, I’ve been stuck on it for two weeks now. It seems as though I’d need spend money to be able to get to the next timeline. A little ridiculous they AI can throw out 30 guys at once meanwhile I’m waiting till I hit 33 to produce one guy."
5,Oligames247,"This game is so awesome due to almost no ads, only when you want them, and the gameplay being addictive."
1,anthony the butt ckeek,The first level is legit impossible I tried it multiple times and I can’t beat it and all you have to do is place one troop but yet the bot gets meat faster than you and the legit solution I kid you not is just lose over and over again until you get enough money from losing to upgrade your stats until you can beat it or get lucky that the bot is stupid
4,Jdjsndhsndhfkjsgd,"The game is fun, it uses strategy, but the only thing that bores me the most, is at the start it's way too hard to get your people/units out. Also I don't like how you start off with 1 health, and the other team starts with 500."
3,boallenbe,"Need to watch 3-4 ads per 30 second round in-game. Upgrade menu was busted for me on iPad so I could only upgrade food production and can’t scroll to other features. Works better on phone, but just gets me to the ads quicker."
1,Case0226,"This game makes you watch an ad constantly if you want to advance without spending 5+ hours a day. It’s repetitive with no payoff. The stats that carry over are minimal, enemy players will start to match those stats to make them irrelevant. Glad I deleted it before too long. Hoping the could’ve been a modernized Age of War remake but I guess the only modernization is monetizing it."
5,Byers Hickmon jr,This game is reminiscent to age of war if you are familiar with that game. But I think it’s actually better because it allows for a going wide strategy which allows for a unique gaming experience.
2,Zay;(,Unless you’re able to dedicate your whole life to this game you can’t progress without watching an Add or paying for double coins (which doesn’t help whatsoever). Options you have to power up aren’t actually beatable and this isn’t even “halfway” through the game.
1,TheSavageDavis,Unless you plan to spend actual money on this game it’s a waste of time. It was super fun at first but it gets to a point where you have to be one evolution ahead to even make it half way on the level. The cards they give you basically do nothing. My total % for health and damage from cards seem like nothing even though it says it’s 200+% for each……
3,Epic-wolf,When you are playing the game the other team has so much of an advantage by being able to spawn 2-3 at a single time when your team is only able to spawn 1 every 8 seconds
2,Gojo0401,The latest update made this game impossible to progress in.  There is a solid paywall where the only next step to continue is to pay more even though the developer is making money off of ads that you watch also.  Frustrating as it was a fairly fun game.
5,this app is really fake,It’s an ad game and is fun to play while watching tv but it’s just grinding then adds but it’s fun to see every new character as u go through good game just need better updates
3,Milox15,Game is actually pretty decent but has serious balancing issues. Either you watch ads to progress further in the game faster or play the same level for HOURS because you need 50k to upgrade your meat produce by .02 seconds each upgrade.
5,SkyTheAdHater,"Don’t listen to the “too many ads” the truth is, all the are optional, you aren’t forced you can do ads for small reward such double the coins you get for an ad! Great game though!"
5,runner😁😁😁😁😁,"So my idea is an online mode that you can like battle you friends, another idea is clans another thing with the online part, and i guess like a factions cuz it just sounds cool"
1,Albaco81,"This game is very frustrating and it forces you to watch ads to improve your troops at a ridiculous slow pace. When you finally upgrade to the next era, you lose all your efforts and resources and have to start again from scratch. If you are an ad watching lover, this game is for you! If you like to lose over and over just to watch another ad, you’ll love this game!"
5,wholesomelorian,Definitely amazing it’s like old school age of war before you could figure out exactly how they play just past the first age and it’s absolutely worth playing
4,RealSpace04,"This game reminds me so much of a game I used to play on the computer when flash game sites were a thing. My only negative is the amount of paid content this app offers, for instance, $11 to permanent enable faster play speed"
3,OtakuOnigiri,Some ads when selected crash or lock up the the game… very frustrating. It’s a grind game so when you loose a little every few ads it gets frustrating… especially Royal Blocks or whatever it’s called
5,Hot dog :),"I love going through the waves and getting all of the new people and going through all of the ages. I just love how it’s relaxing, and I have to work for it at the same time."
4,Kyden Wilford,I like this game an rated it 4 stars since it is hard to beat a bot on the same age but it is just the beginning so i wonder if it can get better when i play for long enough 👍
4,Jakryan,"Took me a little bit to come up with a strategy, but I finally got it and I like it.  Clever little game.  There are ads and you’ll need to watch them to get stronger, but the ads are not overwhelming, and they have merit in the game."
5,Bobby 12349,It’s a very high-quality game for being free and there’s no ads unless you want to get to ask coins or gems I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good game
5,robert29crawfore,"Most games make you watch a lot of ads, but this one doesn’t! Fun to play and involves strategy. This is probably the best game I’ve found in 3 years"
4,olayer5555,This game is really fun I just hate having to watch a ad every 5 minutes to speed the game up. I think y’all should either extend the ad boost timer or just make a one time purchase to have permanent boost
5,i don't want to be scammed,"One of the things I really love about this game is how the developers don’t really collect a lot of information, and that is how I know they are doing it not for them, but for the people who play this game. GG devs!"
5,Wildcat76,"This game is perfect, it’s add free unless you want to watch them for upgrades and it’s super creative. I love this game but I hate it when the other opponents warriors like mainly archers get to camp in their home base whenever I’m attacking it."
5,TREVOR DAWLY,I started today and at the beginning it would be really nice to have 2x speed because the game feels really slow paced but other then that great game
5,Tv ugb,This game seemed really cute and it is just the little figures and how they are drawn and I think they are cute in my opinion but it’s super fun doesn’t have annnoying adds and it has really cool timelines and it’s super fun and cute
2,Qsheygft,"It’s literally half of each. Play a level and lose, so you can watch an ad to gain coins to attempt to win. If you lose again, you get to watch another ad or lose a few more times before moving to the next level. I’m done with it."
3,Kerploosh,"There is not nearly enough content in this game once you get far enough. Hopefully this changes in the future, but the devs haven't added anything new in a couple of months, save for U.I. changes and art improvements."
3,Barblayd,"I used to play this game every morning. Since the last update, the ads play on repeat and I can’t skip them or get the bonuses for watching them. It’s a fun game, but completely unplayable for me currently."
1,Shootingstar80,You are set up from the start to lose. Ok that’s fine….but the only way to get the little army leveled enough you have to watch like a hundred videos and then it moves to a new one and your back to being behind with more videos to watch. I don’t have time to play a game that I spend 90% of the time watching videos
5,????????a???,It’s so good like there’s not that many ads and I enjoy playing it a lot like my new favorite game. I’m on the first part so I can’t imagine what it’s like to get the next part.
1,Gummy bear fan02,"Bland gameplay, visuals, sound, and upgrades. Progress is slow and repetitive and the battles offer virtually nothing in terms of challenge or tactics. It’s just “do you have enough food production to overwhelm your enemy?” There is zero reason to buy base health it actually makes your progression slower by a noticeable amount. I mean honestly what’s here to like? Who was this game made for?"
5,MonteMa1234567,"They don’t force you to watch ads, but progress will take longer without them. I’ve enjoyed the game"
3,solar utopia,"Do you hate natural progression in games and rather watch ads to win? Well this is the game for you, you’ll watch so many ads before you even pass level 1 that you’ll be in cloud nine!  Everything else in the game is good tho"
4,Zandiboi,"Right now I’m on the third timeline, and it’s insane how much the AI gets compared to me. It’s basically like you have to evolve before beating a level and it’s honestly really annoying."
5,imformearth,I love how there are only optional ads to make the game easier and get more rewards!!  It is also really relaxing and I love the simple cute looking graphics.
4,Lolliamhshortsandvideos,I can’t get enough coins because the caveman is cheating because he is sending 2 Dino and then 11 cavemen and 2 ball and then 10 dino and I can’t defeat him unless I watch 10 ads which is not possible and then get 100 meat
1,Baden18830,"Most games do their best to convince you that the sole purpose of the app isn’t just watching ads. These guys didn’t bother.   The game is designed to be impossible to beat on fair ground, when the enemy has the same tech as you. You’re forced to watch ad after ad (for a measly 5 minute speed buff) to try and be competitive.  You will spend more time watching ads than playing the game.   The game is also not fun. The mechanics are bland, not even rock paper scissors bland, we’re talking 52 card WAR bland. So much of you’re success is based on who targets who, and positioning, and you’ve zero control over that.   I’d rather play solitaire, and I don’t even like solitaire."
4,Josh129830,I dont know what happen but this last update yall took out the 1.5x speed for 5 mins option!!! Why???? I will happily watch a vid for the 5 mins of 1.5x speed please bring it back I’m on timeline 30 I love this game please don’t ruin it for me!!!!
5,Gshebshsnalgins d,Play it every chance I get done beat it like 20x each time you beat it you level up get more stuff and it gets way harder
3,Javi2127,This game is good at first but once you play it for awhile you you’ll get bored because it’s the same thing over and over again and you have to grind a lot. The production is only 0.2 every time and it’s hard to move on from the maps
1,Donald West,Only thing i can give them is i didn’t see a false ad campaign for this. The ads are very much accurate. The game actually moves as slow as you see in the ads and if you are paying with time via ads or money you aren’t moving forward. Literal waste of time so i guess that’s fine if that’s what you’re looking for.
1,Taylor Rasay,"Concept is decent, but literally forced to pay money for a game that has no leaderboard or social aspect. No idle money gain, so you’re stuck grinding for money and literally set to just lose for about your first 25-50 games, all so you can add .2 to your production? This game is only to con people out of money or to make money off of the NEED to watch ads to make little progress."
4,85second add,I like this game so much but the adds are long and not that bad but I just got 85 second add of royal match and I couldn’t skip it other than that it’s a great experience that you should play
5,Potato31167,"The ads are only there if u wanna get ahead. No pop ups. Fun little game. I dig I really do, first apple review and would say after like an hour of this thing it is pretty fun"
2,TeeJayPower,"I had in app purchases turned off at the time I downloaded, I launched the game and each time it said “To continue, please allow in app purchases” or something like that as if I was attempting to buy something. Not to mention the game is very ad hungry."
1,NotTakenName99,"Loosing simulator, you CAN NOT WIN. It is impossible to win no matter how much skill or time you put in you will continue to loose over and over and over, I played around an hour straight watching ads and got to the point where I was getting food every second and yet THEY WERE STILL SPAWNING 2-3 troops per 1 I could spawn, doesn’t help you have 2 health to start and they do 10 damage."
5,BMG0730,This game I great 🥹 it's pretty slow but all you need to do is upgrade your base and evolve to the next evolution it really fun 🤣 so I recommend you to play it like actually start playing it 🤩🥳🤯😹👌
4,QueenRhyme,As other reviews stated it’s a very grindy game. After the 200th loss; I finally beat round 1. You’re going to be watching A LOT of ads for boosts. It’s the only way to surpass the ridiculous amount of grinding needing to be done. Granted; I just got past Stone Age.
5,Awoofy2012,This is a great challenging game that I believe everyone should play. This is a great game and I think if you are reading this you should play it. I do not believe in evolution but i think this game is the best!
5,Messier 44,I love this game it's up there with that old game like zombie way when you where in the airplane I played that for days back in the day I even play thru the adds lol
5,The IconStatus,It’s a wonderful game I love the strategy required and it doesn’t force you to watch ads thanks for making this game!
1,Nouyra,Sure it’s ad centric if you want to progress faster but it used to possible. They changed out the cards so you have less damage and health with the new forms. Then they removed the 1.5x time boost for 5 min which you could have had if you watched ads. Also the pricing is ridiculous. Not even worth buying the indefinite 1.5x time boost with real cash. DON’T PLAY THIS GAME.
1,Dope ways,"I purchased the 2x game speed feature and it worked great for a while. I just opened the game, and there was a notification that the devs removed the feature that I paid for with no refund. This game is a scam, they take your money, then remove the features you paid for. Contacting Apple and my band to report for fraud."
4,It’s kinda boring tbh,When I went to a different time zone I couldn’t go back to the one before and if you could add that it would be cool but everything else is nice
3,smpm22,This game seems fun for what I can tell. However it is not for matter for iPad. I have the Air 13 inches and I see images overlapping buttons that I can’t access. I just see them poking at the corners. So I’ll have to delete the game since I can’t really play it.
1,someone98282,"The game would actually be fun if the level progression wasn’t so phenomenally slow, the only way to not spend countless hours of your time leveling up is to watch ads  I get it, everyone needs to make money, but this is one of those games that next to impossible to enjoy without watching ads to level your characters up"
3,JPbruh,The game is fun to play for about 20 min at most. To even get close to the damage output of the AI you have to watch 1 million ads. Every ad does 2x your coins won on that specific round. This has potential.. greedy devs I guess. On to the next.
4,willwin88,"Kinda fun! Very Grindy, the added aren’t pressed on you every 10 sec but your gonna need ads to progress. Progressing is SLOW! But it keeps you wanting to get better in order to beat the AI. Ai has unlimited time and power so good luck!"
4,thelordgambit,Every time I watch an ad it freezes at the end so I have to restart game and lose all previous progress from the last battle. Please fix this
1,Vef5,"The concept could be fun. But you literally cannot win. The AI is always 5 steps ahead of what is possible for the player in game (unless you spend $20 I’m guessing), there’s no opportunity for strategy and after a solid hour of trying to make any progress I realize it’s completely pointless and it’s not even fun, just frustrating"
4,Byahtzee,"Great game, very fun but a little slow pace at the beginning but further you go the better it gets as getting able to buy more upgrades for characters and your base."
1,Rncidnskvdnicncjrnc,Game is extremely boring and impossibly difficult even with the ad bonuses. I imagine this game could be fun after an hour or so but losing 50x in a row doesn’t seem very appealing. I would rate this lower if I could because this is just a pathetic ad revenue farm that you can’t even play without wasting 30seconds to watch ads at the beginning and end of each stage.
5,Cheer chick 21212121,It’s fun and they’re only saying they can’t beat it because they’re not playing enough really really really really really fun
4,Arshmosis,"To start it’s a great game concept! But they say NO ADs, there is ads and the game and you MUST watch them to even think about beating 1st match! I’ve been playing for 4 days and watching every add and I just now beat battle 1!"
5,JonaswasTAKEN,I played it at first and was bored but played it for a little more and ended up loving it! You should try it because the more you play the more awesome troops you unlock!
5,BenNettey,Can we get more custom heroes? Arthur is cool but id like some mid range heroes with aoe and long range units as usable heroes. Maybe they can be unlocked every 25 or 50 timelines to get people excited about climbing up in timelines.
5,Surgarypeaches68,You only watch ads if you want extra coins. There are no annoying random ones and the game is actually fun.
5,Bekorf,"I enjoyed, as far as I have gotten to ingame, quite a lot and will most likely continue this for awhile to see where it goes from here."
5,Xavier Morfin,This game is so fun I have been playing it for hours. I cannot take my eyes off my phone after I downloaded this game. There is no bugs and it is perfect!
1,Dcapalbo,The first level literally forces you to lose over and over again because mathematically it is literally impossible to produce enough resources to defend yourself. So you end up getting absolutely massacred for the first 50 attempts until you slowly chip away with meager amounts of coins that barely upgrade your stats unless you watch the ads for boosts. Got bored real fast.
5,?????.??,"I played Age of War back on CoolMath, this game as far as i can see, has no ads and is exactly like that just simpler. And it’s difficult! It’s engaging and it slightly makes me mad at times which I LOVE!! great game!"
2,snowclimb,It take too long to actually get anywhere. Especially since it’s the same exact map basically. It should take 20 times just to get to the next evolution. While making sure you watch ads since you can’t get much $ without.
5,wassssssssuuuh,One of the best games I’ve played in a while you got to try it out it’s easy and fun and doesn’t take a lot of time fun and quick to do and enjoyable
4,ufofypxxyp,I love this game a lot it’s very fun challenging but there’s one thing that is happening there’s this bug where I can’t replenish my keys or my  Legends and my daily 100 gems also don’t work it’s just a plain grey line
5,moon man123,"I love how this game only has optional ads, maybe to just get a bit more coins, plus it’s highly addictive! I’m pretty sure I might have got my mom to play it too…"
2,Mental1c3man,If you have enough patience then you can keep progressing. Dont spend money on it though. I spent more money on this game that I should have saved for the sake of progress that I should have just kept. Honestly don’t play it unless you don’t have another option. But it’s a really good time filler.
3,"""FrAnKi3""","Really enjoyed playing this game. It’s a real time killer. Had it for 3 weeks or so, spent 0$  Pros: if you’re looking for a easy mindless game, this is it.   Cons: the first progression of every level is incredibly so, making it quite boring for that first step from “level 1 to level 2” - in quotations cuz I wouldn’t call them levels.  I had a lot of fun playing for a bit, but by the 4th time I opened the app, I was dreading how incredibly slow that first step was. Closed it on week 2, and haven’t revisited it since."
4,Good game also bad game,The start goes very slow and it takes too much too evolve I think the upgrades and evolve in should cost less but overall a pretty good game
5,Peypey0423,It don’t force you to watch ads but they are super helpful at the beginning
1,MMoscho,"This game forces you to watch 45 second ads on games you probably won’t download in order to build your level up otherwise you’re not going anywhere. I don’t recommend games that waste your life watching ads that you don’t care for. if you have a life, don’t waste your time with this game."
5,ritter88,Fun and pretty simple game that has been great to play while up with a newborn at all hours. Hoping for more content like new timelines and new events in the future.
4,BiGG_KellZz,The Game is Cool. The 2x Ads deactivate after Transport. I did it a few times because the money adds up kinda slow in the beginning but it speeds up as you through the Timeline.
1,Disgruntled zombie hunter.,Horrible game design. Starts out with you being at such a huge disadvantage that you cannot win. Forces you to watch videos to upgrade to think you have a chance only… you still don’t. They designed it to do minimal work. They don’t have to build a new level if you can’t beat level 1 right??
5,Wandering_person,I also got 569 food at one point and it was nice anyway nice game and keep updating please
1,Prestly Alexi,"If you wanna waste your time with a mindless, borderline idle game that has next to no thought whatsoever put into its design, boy have I found the game for you. Literally got soft locked by beating the 2nd age and progressing to the 3rd before I had the gold to evolve or the strength to kill even a single unit from the 3rd age. That means I have no method to get more gold so no ability to upgrade or progress. Great design👍🏼"
5,Fade7676,After getting through the grinding ITS A GREAT GAME though it’s a copy they take the concept way further then imagined it’s beyond those trashy games this is actually really fun
2,Archersdad12215,Great game but little to no room for leveling up how many soldiers you can drop and at what speed opponents are always better than you and it takes a long time to attempt to level up the speed at which you can afford them. Pay to play for sure
5,7854366436653,This is an amazing game to play. With only 1 improvement I deem necessary. It should allow cloud storage or data transfer of some sort. Or Apple ID sign in.
5,Ch!gg@,The game is entertaining for long rides and it keeps me entertained for a long time. I would not find the game if I did not have a lot of road trips.
5,$ProGamer$,No annoying forced ads just play and enjoy and if you want to excel faster watch an ad.
1,Ignii,"There used to be a purchase of 1.5x game speed but dev got greedy and took it away from new players (so you have to watch more ads) one month ago. People join before that still have it. For new players, you will play a much slower game, and there is weekly race where you are doomed coz everyone else can race 1.5x faster."
1,Jason slanina,"When I hit the link on this game, I saw nothing about a price. when I looked at the download button and the rest of the screen before pushing the download button, I saw nothing about a price. One asked me to confirm purchase it did not list a price.  But then my account was hit with either a placeholder or a one dollar charge. I’m not sure which."
2,Drexler Thinks,The game is okay except how annoying it is to progress in the game. I understand what they are trying to do but majority of the time you will be watching ads to boost how much you earn a level which can be draining. The cpu spawns so many troops in one sitting it can make the game exhausting and frustrating. It’s okay at most
4,I’m stupid,Ok what I hate about this game is that when I spawn a unit the opponents base spawns the same one except faster. Like it gives them a clear advantage and please remove that it makes me angry. Wait which base is mine???? The 500 or the 6 health?
5,Peter College student,"It’s very few and far between that a game is exactly as advertised. If you liked the ad, then you will like this game."
5,galaxyfighter287,I like the game. Definitely a 9/10 for me. I’m playing it and now my 6 year old son is also playing it haha. But it’s worth the download.
4,Amulight,"I love this game and all but why is lvl one so hard? 500 health seriously? Pls lower it. Why do I get so little health? Why are they able to spawn enemies faster? C’mon if your gonna make the game hard, make it fair."
5,Arch3r2014,First you don’t need wifi to play. Second there are smooth animations and the best thing about this game is that there are no ads whatsoever i have to admit that I love this game!
4,Connor Marcoux,"The game is slow at first, but once you get to the 3rd stage, you start progressing faster and to the point that you can’t stop playing. Highly recommend!"
5,El Cuhhh.,Thought it was just another one of thoses dumb ad games but I tired it as a joke and now I can’t get off😂. Its a fun and addictive game and definitely kept me entertained.
2,Dirtygibz,This game is fun!  But come on. You start with a base of 0 health 1 hit and your base is destroyed. Meanwhile the starting enemy had a base of 500?  And the upgrades on production units is so terribly scaled.  Have to play 3 rounds to get enough gold to increase it then it increases by .13 seconds?  Meanwhile the enemy can way out produce units!  Make it a little easier. This is crazy.  Plus the enemy units
1,ZakGuyer,"Nothing I like better than starting a new game and immediately losing my first 20 matches because the opponent is intentionally overpowered. This game is lose lose lose in order to try to scrape together enough coins to be able to be competitive, then progress to another level to begin losing again. If I wanted to lose this much, I’d go to Vegas.  Deleted."
5,Whshdhsh,"The perfect game for killing some time. It’s simple and straightforward, and it doesn’t bombard you with ads every 10 seconds"
1,Krshlln300,I have been playing for a while and am no longer receiving daily quests or any other daily activities like the keys for the zombie outbreak… these are important as they are the main path to getting the necessary currency for getting updates.  Unless fixed the game is effectively pointless to play. As mo real progression can be effectively made.
5,Good game2185556,I don’t see nothing wrong with it besides you should be able to upgrade your units
1,er*k,"From the start of the game, you’re aware The game was designed to get as many ads from you without rewarding you with any ounce of effort from the developer side. For the amount of work you attempt to invest into the game, you will receive very little positive experience. I’m also convinced all these five star reviews are like super fake."
1,MMoore141968,"You can progress so far with out opening your wallet.  The events are impossible with out purchasing the event packs.  Stay away from this game.  All they care about is you watching ads and paying to play.  Oh, let’s not start on the whole having to click the close ad X 3 times before the ad closes."
4,Maberry_01,The game is fun to pass the time i do however not like that you have to watch an add every time to boost your currency. Just an idea maybe have a 2x currency multiplier like you have for the speed up game time.
5,Better than virtual reality,It’s a very fun game when you battle and you get to upgrade your units you can progress your units from caveman to farm men and another great bonus It has no ads.
2,Mick4086,"Have fun playing this without watching ads. Every food production upgrade is only worth .02 while youre spending hundreds if not thousands of coins, so what’s the point in grinding if you’re going to have to watch an ad just to be able to afford the food in a timely manner"
2,Jaymes!!,Been playing this game for quite sometime  EVERY update makes the game play worse and more difficult. You even took away the button that speeds it up! No amount of free wheel spin will make up for the “improvements” that have made the game play BORING!!
3,KHHR*,"I really liked this game before. I purchased the speed upgrades, but a recent update took them away. I got refunded with green tokens but I would rather have the speed back. Now it feels excruciatingly slow"
2,jonesvapelounge,For the pass two events it keeps crashing back to the game’s Home Screen. It’s even more insufferable is you need to watch ads to get places. So you watch the get the bonus almost beat the round just to have it crash to home screen and lose it.
4,Fatty2nd,"Very fun game with a simple gameplay loop, only thing that would make it better is if you could pay to get a permanent speed boost rather than watching an ad every 5 min."
5,Davelegoo,This game is really good and the ad service is even breyer there is no ads but until u want to watch it for double the coins or the shop
5,Spiderjax3214,So there are no ads unless you ask for them. It’s a really fun game if you read this review please make the meat generator a little faster and that’s all I have to say.
5,fullsendcarl,I have been searching for a game like this for a while one where you don’t get bombarded with ads it reminds me a lot of games from my early teen year
5,Carter patterson,I love the game and I would play it everyday but we get the coins to slowly like we need 1000 coins for each hour we are offline
5,why!?!why why,There are no ads unless you want to get extra stuff. This game is so fun and entertaining. You should 1000% get it. Five stars
5,justincase777,Fun game to play and pass time makes you feel like your building your way up so your not just flying through the game
3,please just see this.,If they added key features to the game to make so not repetitive it would honestly be a fantastic game but the problem is that they aren’t bringing the game to its max potential but when they do it’ll be a blast.
5,Bob Foss73670,"The graphical bugs have been fixed I can now use the game as intended, have re-rated it to five stars."
5,qwertyuiopasghhoxhdjdnd,So I was just looking for some dumb app to buy and I saw this so I tried it and got addicted easily there are ads but there are almost none so it’s great.
5,𝓕𝓾𝓵𝓵𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮𝓴𝓲𝓷𝓷𝔂,It won’t let me scroll down on my upgrades for some reason
5,Rome the second,I really love this game because no internet and that.  Pro tip don’t play for a little bit and it will auto complete your card levels
2,jstnngyn,"They managed to combine Age of War, gacha, and annoying ads into one app! Amazing! Even when you do want to watch ads for a reward sometimes the ad wont even load and you'll have to restart the app, lose the ad reward, AND lose the regular coins you earned from that dungeon"
2,Poo guy from gorila tag,This game is kinda fun but ads it’s the problem ads in others say this game needs no wifi but you need wifi and as soon a click no more gems button it brings me to an ad for no reason and it interrupted my game time and bugs too the same for ads
3,KmooRising,There’s minimal strategy and variation in tactics. It’s mostly built to push ads. Otherwise it would take you 4x longer to advance.   Only your characters change but the rest is the same thing over and over.
2,pnp2000,"The ads in the app doesn’t work, most of the time it’s just black screen for a while and after that you get nothing. And ads for food in the game is ridiculous, when you finish watching ads (if it works) your base will be destroyed, so it’s just useless."
5,AsapRojas,"The fact this game doesn’t have adds , only if you want to get (extra coins ) is a huge plus for me ."
5,jmo236s,Make more games like this. I support this game and bought some gems. Enjoyable game to waste time while waiting or sitting my car. Make More cool simple games like this!
5,gdiaiejvpananc,The ads take to long when watching them shorter ads would be much more enjoyable
3,dkhebsbs,Fun game but having to watch ads to progress at a decent rate is ridiculous plus half of the time the ads freeze and you don’t even get the reward you were after.
4,Kabitobill,"Effort this game was slow and I wasn’t sure about it but as it picked up as you go along, I’m really starting to like it. I’ll give a update on how finally feeling."
2,Mr 13836,When I play it the food production is so slow u can hardly place 3 people and they spawn like 20 guys it’s stupid I get u have to upgrade it blah blah blah but when I upgrade it only puts 0.2 speed at least make it 4 or 5 the game is alright but make the food production better good part is no ads which is good.
1,Johnathan feezy,"The game overall is a fun time waster, lots of content and progression. Ad model was decent, not an ad spam.  But the developer removed the ability to speed up the game, and removed the purchase that people had made. Switching it to 2x gold instead. This is not what people paid for, the game is incredibly slow now and not fun."
5,TheBealler,"For once it is like it says and you only have to watch ads to boost not to continue!, liking this one!,"
5,Bear tachine,I like this game. And it is really fun for car rides or offline it’s the best offline game ever. I would recommend playing this game.
1,kill me cuz life is the worst,The progression rate takes forever and makes no sense as to why the AI has the upper hand when it comes to going to “battle” with it. If you make a game based off progression why can’t you start off where it’s fair and then improve instead of just forcing beginners to have to wait and watch ads just so they can win.
3,Benuleethegreat,This game is super fun but it’s very hard to get enough meat to get your army and I had to mostly rely on ads for lots of meat and in the end I used an ad for meat and got 7 Dino’s to finally beat level 1. And also you start with 2 hp while the enemy gets 500 hp
5,Veronyka’s review,"I give this a five star because it’s interesting I like that you can evolve time, I really like this game, you can play it with no WiFi too"
5,Roblox…sounds good,"At first, it was so hard but then I came up with the strategy to just spam the meat thing and then I got money super fast and I really enjoy it"
4,JaeJae🤍🤍🤍,It’s not click bait or anything. Barely had any adds unless you actually choose to watch one. Over all a great way to pass time👍🏽
3,Zyvvrict,"At least within the first level, there is no way to pay to skip ads.  Interesting premise but too grindy without ads, and no way to pay to skip."
3,87942389463278946872314678,"I personally don’t like this game, for one reason. You can’t scroll in this game but there is more to unlock. So you can barely see the button they want you to press to level up."
5,AlWicker,Slow start but once you get into it it evolves very quickly. Need more heroes and events!!
5,Daddygh,It is frustrating when you constantly get your base destroyed but when you make progress and destroy the enemies base it feels 1000% better. Ovr good game
5,jmikks,It is a very fun game you start off as a caveman you go through a bunch of regions it is a very challenging game but very entertaining game I honestly love it 10 out of 10
5,TheRobloxDev,"When i downloaded the game i wasn't expecting much, but the game is great. It is very polished and has a great art style and the game play is smooth. Overall a good pick."
3,fiaher4425,"The enemy is always better in till I have a higher tier or i upgrade my production up to like 5 add more ways to get gems and add a way to upgrade the guys like fire rate, damage, range, and cost and they can spawn WAY to much in a min while I can’t in even 5"
5,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzbzzzzzzzzzzzz,I like this game cause its simple. Its does not have ads unless you pick to watch them. And i get so happy when the speed picks up and I mop the floor woth the enemy
4,Misterytallman,You choose to watch ads but the solitaire cash ad whenever it comes out the game stays dark and I have to close and reopen the app and nothing add up.
3,Sklly84,I like playing but it seems every other time i watch an add to double awards then screen goes black and i cant get past so have to close game and re open and loose everything i just earned.
4,good ducks,It’s a very fun game too play while watching a boring movie or just for fun. It’s not too detailed it is interesting and makes me wanna play it more. Yet it could have more depth but still very fun besides that.🖤
5,Vloresit,Very fun game that doesn't force ads! I would've deleted this a long time ago if there were ads.
3,Dsmonkie,"Was enjoying the game, im on timeline 3 (stage.. 13) figured ill cough up the ridiculous $11 ($1 value) for 1.5 speed right? Instantly now get offers for x2 speed, still forced to watch ads. How are you gonna charge $11 and still force ads!!?"
3,Gigaus,"Great idea, just a bit too slow. It’s just another ad game sadly, so much lost potential. Our community enjoy it for a bit, but then it’s just repetitive since it’s a bit too slow."
2,yeetdfbhtdgjidhff,"i like that all of the ads aren’t required, although it feels like i still spend half my time on the game watching ads. i’m still stuck on battle six because the ai has such a large upper hand. it feels like it has infinite food, and it doesn’t stop spamming the spaceship."
5,Gamer casey16,Ok I like it because other games the 1 level is ez but no its challenging it took a 10 or 15 of losing so try it out for yourself
3,I’m choosing as no nickname,Really good game when you get in it by the starting point it’s really hard but it’s great for passing time. No this is not a bot review I like this it just needs some balancing on the start
5,👍🏻😻🤩👍🏻😻🤩,"Absolutely love this game! Best mobile game today, thank you so much for the no forced ads! However.. when ranged units start camping the enemy base they are unable to attack the enemy ranged inside the base."
1,Undertaker17107,"You have to watch ads to play the game, and a LOT of them. Basically the game starts with you being physically unable to win or even get close even if you watch pretty much constant ads for an hour. Not even a “grind fest” since there’s no reward at any point, it’s just watching ads and watching ads"
5,I am a kid and I’m poor,"I love this game! This is a great roadtrip game, and doesn’t need wi-fi! Very addictive, i’ve just got this game a hour ago and i’m in the spartan age! Don’t be afraid to download if you love types of these games."
5,🤨🐪,Prefect game to play when your bored and pretty fun! Also it’s great to show your friends and easy to play! So I’d give it 5 stars
1,UteFam,Most games wait a few rounds to spring the spend money or watch ads trap on you. Not this one. Battle 1 you cannot get through unless you spend a bunch of money or watch a plethora of ads to build up. Battle 1! Overt money trap and they don’t even hide it. I guess maybe they should earn a star for that.
5,i suggest this,Whenever I have my phone I love to get into we are warriors and forget about everything else.
5,$.'zbshzhshfj,Please make it atleast 10 quests a day bc 5 takes 10 mins to do. Make more missions maybe speed boost or something too
5,T_sull25,No ads only when you click on the thing you want with ads. Easy game slow paced. If you are board play this W game.
5,The ninja 269,This game always amuses me and I don't get bored their are timelines so you can play over and over again great game you will regret not getting the game
1,Bentley A,"It’s a simple and fun premise but you’re basically forced to buy the unlocks.  After playing the game for a few days, the devs decided to just reverse a bunch of and lock the rest even further out of reach. Already made progress? They don’t care. You can have it back when you get it later. Total garbage."
1,mistb0rn,To start there’s so many bugs. Their bug fixes need bug fixes. Also be prepared to watch a ton of ads. Recently they’ve removed a “forever” paid purchase and was censoring forums by locking comments (recently unlocked). I would not recommend spending any money with this ad simulation of a game.
3,I don’t really know tbh,"i love this game but there’s one small issue. half the time i go to watch an ad (it’s always one of those playable ads) when the ad ends you can’t click on anything, it’s just stuck. so then i have to close and reopen the app just for it to sometimes happen again. no other app does this. fix your app please. this just started recently. i’ve been playing for months."
5,Bknuggs,This game is really fun in car rides and when your bored I’ve been playing nonstop for seven days it’s so fun so I really reckon you try it
4,Coviper,Instead of using the card system for buffs it should be used for character to use
1,Noob16382,Good game but you need to spend so much time to advance to the game (which is tedious) but to progress faster the give you options too look at adds to 2x your money which is also tedious. I just see it as a loose loose situation. Maybe for others they like it but this takes up too much of my time
4,GameBoy_boy,I played this game and it was so fun. The progression takes a while though. Other than that it is a really fun game an I would recommend downloading it.
5,Woodsy1827,This game is relaxing to play not much skill involved and you dont have to watch ads one of the best games I have ever seen
1,crunchy zebra,"Pretty basic, extremely slow and grindy but the worst part is to really progress you have to watch ads but those same ads will sometimes crash your game leaving you with no gold as if that match you just sat through didn’t happen. I value my time too much to waste it on a crash prone game like this."
4,d4rk000,so this game is really fun and it’s a game where you really need to take time to get good at it but the start is really hard to pass and get through and it’s a bit confusing when you start but once you start playing it gets more fun as you go on and this game is really fun and it’s exciting to see what map and characters come next. would recommend if you have a lot of time.
1,abcdefhownnev,"One of the slowest and most annoying games I’ve played. I have no idea what mid -late game will be like so I can’t comment on that. What I can comment on is the absolute trash pile this game is, clash of clans walls seem to be nothing compared the the amount of grind you need to level up in this. Steer clear unless you want to watch plenty of ads or pay plenty of money"
1,Jacksonthedestroyer,"I made it to timeline 3. The progression takes too long. The game only gets fun once a player gets meat production up to 2s. The skill effects are too short and they don’t recharge during battle. The cards have different faces, but they all do the same thing, health or damage. I’d enjoy going back to timelines after I beat them.  Meat production needs to be adjusted significantly."
4,Gears nut,I had rated this game one star because it kept crashing. They fixed the bug and crash  Now just need more ages to progress through
4,merstery,It won’t let you scroll down in the upgrade screen where you can upgrade your health.
2,thatboijoekiii,"Is what the game needs to be called, the progression is too slow and it puts you in a position where watching ads is faster and more efficient than playing the game. Once you figure out the system, the game just repeats itself"
5,SilantLoner805,"It’s the only game that actually works. It doesn’t force you to watch adds, it’s fun and what you see is what you get"
5,Dragon egg69420,This game is amazing it’s hard but it kinda has a pay to win but I have not been playing this game for a while and I’m on timeline 2 the British empire
4,agent_dud,Its not bad ill say that but there could be a faster way to beat the levels at the start other than 1.5x speed you know?
5,Ralphyeats your cheese,"I love how this game can be challenging yet fun. It does a good job of adding ads as an option, instead of you having to watch them. I’m addicted rn"
2,I have just started this game,"The game is OK it’s a fun game where you pick caveman against caveman and more from what I’ve seen in the evolution, but there is a lot of ads mostly for Robux games which are complete scams by the way, but I think it’s a good game so I am giving it two stars because it’s decent but not that great"
5,ʜᴇʏᴀᴠᴀɢɪʀʟ,It’s a good game but the characters need to be faster but I have it a five star because the ads are real and I’m in a good mood today
5,Mobaomba,I’m on timeline 56 and the game is strangely addictive once you get past timeline 10 it goes pretty fast -a new dungeon to unlock the blue potions faster   -new skills -new cards and a new rarity of card would be cool - some new and better contests/online mini games(they’re kinda time consuming and not worth it) -new runes a cool one would be a chance to attack faster
2,Ghost_ship_supreme,They pad the game by making each “age” excruciatingly slow to obtain and trickling money you need to upgrade income. Not like the classic castle battle games. It has potential… but there’s just no content past the second age it feels like… if there is I don’t feel like grinding to see it.
2,Isaiah606,"In the beginning, it is really hard I couldn’t get passed the first level and it just was being unfair by spawning the strongest warrior multiple time. But the rest of the time it was pretty fun and I liked it. That’s it just make the start easier!"
4,ctyjsttsjhjthhjfsfgsns,At the start you can watch adds to win but when evolve to the farm you can see that it is not as hard
1,Bonquavier,"I made an apple id account for this game (so the data could save) and it didn’t. What happened was that I tried to use a shortcut on the game, and the game failed and wouldn’t open. Then, when I removed the shortcut, the whole app removed. When I redownloaded it, all of my data was lost. I also spent 15 dollars on this game.."
3,vungmunyhor,"Forced to watch to progress and get that 2x coins, but literally every half an hour I get that stupid ad that freezes my game forcing me to restart it and lose my progress on the previous round."
5,sjejsjjssd,I think this game is really fun because of how simple it is but I just one question Please make the legends easier please it’s too hard and I’m timeline 16
4,ga has sh,I love the game but the progression is just too slow I’ve been playing for two days and still haven’t been able to beat the first cave
2,dhyyeg,Frustrating every event and always the first ad you watch to get double rewards—Freezing up and wastes your time. Devs have no communication with game breaking bugs and no compensation for their bugged game after 2 events. Radio silence and false promises. Frustrating and annoying.
2,Hernan1056,"The game is incredibly lopsided as the computer continuously progresses beyond your ability.  Too many ads, which you have to watch in other to stay competitive against the computer. The rewards are not worth the wait."
3,Chumpgoddam,"I was having fun with this game but realized that all this game is, is just watching ads and ads and ads. Like thousands of ads. The person who made this game must be literally swimming in ad revenue. Probably millions of dollars tbh lol. So I stopped playing cuz I don’t wanna support that"
2,xXZander808Xx,"Events come around weekly and I played 3 of them.  Of the 3 events, 2 of them require you to buy one of their “deals” to help you progress further into the event.   Without them, progression is extremely steep. Enemies come at you in groups (and often) and you’re unable to respond to those attacks because food production is slow.   It would be manageable if our cards’ stat boosts carry over. Other than that, events are basically cash grabs; you won’t be able to get far without buying their deals."
5,zzaqd666,Easy to learn but there is definitely some strategy as far as what upgrades to allocate your resources to
5,sic.davi,These games can get a little repetitive or they can become stupidly overwhelming or both! This game so far is fun to play and is neither overwhelming or repetitive.
2,Annoyed w this,"Unless you’re paying to play, don’t waste your time. The first level is outrageously difficult and you HAVE to watch about an hour of ads for a slight chance to beat it. Not fun. Don’t recommend.  The graphics are simple but cute."
1,djjdjdjfhc,The game is exact game play over and over it just takes longer to beat every time until you hit a point we’re u have to pay to beat a part just to repeat the process it’s a ad / money scam game tbh you will be doing the exact same game play at lvl 1 as you do lvl 100
5,Ali TgTv,"This game is so challenging that’s the thing that make is better and hard, you gotta thing of what troop you will attack with and saves coins to get better and BETTER troops. AMAZING!!!"
5,Jessy611,Absolute complete joy!!!!! I love the strategy and execution it takes to get through to each level.
1,Builder535353,Just a game designed for you to watch all apps all the time if you wanna progress at all you have to watch ads so irritating deleted the game after my first time travel you pretty much start from scratch I don’t know who gave this game all these high review stars it’s terrible. Ratings may be fake
5,nickisona,"Super fun, can’t stop playing it. This is gonna be the only game I play for the rest of my car ride. Currently on the farm stage! Definitely a grind, but extremely fun! 🤩"
5,you are a savage,This game is sooooo fun a addictive but it takes a lot of skill and thinking You need to download this  It’s also kinda hard
5,Zhsjsnsjd,Right when I got this game I was addicted and I played it so much my screen time was around 13 hours a day!!! But it’s so fun download this game!!!
3,Littlelindseycup,"This game has potential and it’s a good game but it’s way too slow. Everytime I go to purchase more time of meat or idk what it’s called but it seems like it’s going the same speed everytime. Great game, too slow."
4,TheKing7479,The game is fun it just requires boring times of not unlocking anything and doing the same thing over and over again
3,I luv capybaraaaaz,"So I understand the concept and all, you are like leading an army, traveling into different points in time. But hear me out, you have to watch adds to literally only win a single round! How absurd is that!? Anyways, it’s kind of a mediocre.  BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
1,LTR95,"The gameplay loop is horrendously slow. You start at an immediate loss and you are given enough coins to upgrade one thing, which results in your next 3-4 losses. Each time you lose you are offered increased money to watch an ad.  The pace of this game would need to be altered dramatically to make this game worth playing."
5,Dan the mannnnnnnnnnnn,Since age of war I’ve been looking for another really fun game like this. This is exactly what I’ve been looking for. Super fulfilling and tons of fun!
5,Columbus type,Super cool idea to have the whole house thing on a giant enemies you unlock Stone Age to form right in your house with your own weapon to fight the enemies in the game with the sword and then use it for a fight
5,Ibsjhdu*j,A lot of features and more re playable than war of age because you can finish aow in one play through
5,TubularMedusa31,This is a good game to play when in the car or something like that it’s enjoyable it’s not complicated like other games that are like this
4,Seplecter,The gameplay of this game is really nice but I would suggest making it easier for players to get upgrades and progress more into the game
5,SmallFly20,It’s really entertaining and you don’t need to watch many ads. It can keep you busy for a long time.
5,lsag2020,"So far, there are no forced ads. You can watch ads to increase your earnings. Fun game. Slow at first, but you will get the hang of it."
5,………..:):$82&/‘,Love the game though i wish that we could evolve through the ages that we have been through
5,byggyxterdtxtyrfcftcvguyg,But when you play this game as an begginer its hard to play beacuse they will ome shot all your guards but as you move on you get stronger
2,SpeedSpider333,You can watch ads to get double the rewards witch is great but the ad for one merging game that had a duck for the icon always buffers to the point of closing the app so you loose all of your rewards please work on what ads you allow
4,Create nickname1998,Needs some achievements or something else to work towards. It can get really repetitive and I’d love something else to have to get
3,Hi flame lord,Bro decent game takes my brain off of stuff cool but why doesn’t the pause in game actually pause the game it just ask do you wanna quit but the little guys are still moving in the back of it all
1,Yalone Dee Willis 3rd,"Not only is this game slow, but it is DESIGNED so that you just watch ads over and over and over again and you can’t really progress without doing it. It was fun for a while but as you get further on it’s literally impossible to beat without ads."
3,sayermontalvo1,"I enjoy it enough  I wish I could guide my guys a certain direction or formations. I usually playing it in between jobs or tasks in my business. It’s short , so don’t really have to worry about a game taking to long."
5,E’lnbbsuabnkfub,It’s a fun game that you won’t be able to beat in just 30 minutes.
5,JaydeyBug,This game is very entertaining! It never shoves adds in your face AND you can play it without WiFi!! Would 100% recommend!!
5,Why all is taken,"Your game is one of the best games I ever played and it’s so competitive,I hope you make more games like this and have a nice day:)"
4,It’s jovoi,Really fun and entertaining gets a little repetitive but then you beat the level and get a fresh new level just wish there was one more stat to upgrade.
5,NO NO NO HEY HEY No,This game has no ads at all really fun and is a no WiFi game I really do recommend playing this it is worth your time!!
1,Addiction2bass,They make it so you cannt win without playing a super bunch of times losing or your forced to watch all they ads for bonuses which is so unfair! Who wants to play a game for hours and hours just to beat first level! Nope deleting! Y’all don’t even ease into it…. Level base 2 when opponent is 500 full evolution….. Smdh y’all too much nope!
5,Peniways 2.0,"I have 1k blue potions and all my skills are in the max level, I need another thing to use it, or to exchange to the green coins or to red potions"
3,Dan01k,"It’s not fair that the other team has 500 on their cave or something like that and were having it like at 2,16,29 and they 500 so like what’s the point of playing when ur always losing-_- you should fix it"
5,mrmusqito on tiktok,Thus game is really fun it’s a chill game and there’s really isn’t anything bad about the game one thing I do not like is the amount of enemies  there are every round
2,Oprah Winfrey's Cat,This game would be fun if the enemy didn’t instantly upgrade to an unbeatable level the second you beat them. You spend so much time and coins upgrading only for them to upgrade way past you right after you finally win once.
2,CSharer😁,Way too unbalanced when it comes to damage for your characters. Also when it comes too trying to counter the enemy numbers. Not saying it should be to where you walk through every stage but your units do less damage than the AI.
5,SportstersRule75,"The graphics are amazing and the little people areLike stick for years, and I love drawing them in a battle this makes my heart content"
1,Caleb92903,This game is the epitome of a cash grab. The progression is unbelievably slow and the only way to make it bearable is to watch ads to to get coins faster. There are also objectives that tell you to watch ads to complete the objective. The game could be good if they didn’t basically force you to watch ads to progress in the game.
1,WeAllFallOneDay,Play to play garbage. I played for around 1 hour and was still getting beat by the first base. You gain so little gold you only can upgrade once a battle and it’s painfully slow but of course there’s a ad at the end of every battle too double the gold you can get. Just another cash grab phone game.
1,Player Review.,"It’s a very simple idea for a game. Evolution but as soon as I downloaded it the game kept crashing after opening. Now I can’t play it and I only got like 10 mins on it. So now I’m hooked but can’t play. Tried deleting then redownloading but nope, tried restarting my phone power off power on nope. Idk what to do :("
2,Ghytfhit,"It’s ok. It’s definitely a money/ad watch sink. You progress insanely slow and the levels are clearly designed to bar your progress until you spend enough time (days) grinding, watch ads every level, or spend your money. The animations are meh at best."
5,Yumgtynfghv,If you’re looking for a game that can get your mind off of things then this is the perfect game for you.
1,Swellam,"Its just impossible to win the first few rounds. You have to play at least 10-15 rounds of loses, watch ads to double your coins so you can upgrade your food then it resets (send you to another timeline or whatever) and you need to do all that again"
5,DaJakemin,This game is amazing and ads are your choice it is a very fun game and it is offline so I can play it with no internet
5,TheOriginalBoots,And I love it
2,djm3839,"Extremely slow progression without ads. Fun, mindless concept but the only way to get enough resources to progress at a satisfying pace is to watch an ad on every single multiplier option they give. Lame. Hope it improves."
1,NorthWestMade,Has potential to be fun but progression is too slow. You need to watch 12 ads a day or use real money if you want to progress at a normal rate in this game.  Also ads will sometimes not work so you will watch it and get no reward or the ads will last 30-60 seconds.
3,Tubbz233,"First few levels are fun, after that it's just a grinding ad machine to progress. Very repetitive and lacking enough variety to hold your interest for more than an hour or two"
4,"Sullivan S,","I think this game is great, I just think it would be cool to make it so you can increase the health of your warriors, if that is a thing, I just haven’t unlocked/ seen it yet."
5,Overcrowded kid,I’m addicted!! This game is so much fun I love it!! It’s kinda hard to get meat for the soldiers. But overall the game is really fun! 10/10 would recommend
5,Nguyen cardin,I can watch a ad for like 30 food and get like a few farmers and kill the enemy
5,Polkadotkiller,I was playing this game and it’s not like the others it actually puts up a challenge
3,Syaheicereeze,Add permanent 2X game speed no ad and permanent 2X battle reward no ads in the store. And add a custom war where we can mix and match warriors from different eras and timelines and challenge the previous levels as well as a survival battle mode.
4,Game enjoyer💲💸,I love playing this game but the levels are to hard that you have to watch an add for more meat or evolve your units to pass the level please make the game easier
4,Oytrain,"This is a great game, but I think it would make a great game, by also having it get more downloads, simply by adding it to other App Stores, like Google Play."
5,Ninaflooper,This game is wonderful it’s kinda hard but not to hard it’s so fun you can like buy better people and stufff and just yeah it’s amazing
5,(epic)Jax,Game ad on tiktok i kept getting it and eventually i was curious enough to get it. Not an over exaggeration to say one of the best mobile game out there
3,NilObject,"This game is ok, but there’s no way to pay to disable ads. The game for the most part didn’t force ads but today the only way to progress my dailies would be to watch ads. Uninstalled."
2,mehguy69420,hello. i was enjoying the game i was first place in the race event starting right on new years 2024 or around then. i was playing the game on my trip and after landing i was continuing playing the event i was at the 6th stage of timeline 8 and for some reason the event was saying it was over. it ended and instead of my reward the event started again with a new timer for two hours. i was put into 40th place and my reward was removed. i enjoy this game and would like to continue playing please fix this.
3,altman,The enemies are two many in number it’s super annoying having two fighters on your side and all of a sudden the enemy summons 9 at once. And especially when it’s any unit with a ranged attack my side just gets wiped out. It’s so irritating.
5,KidFrostt,"See a lot of people complaining but tbh it’s a good game it’s not hard at all (skill issue) but I don’t mind watching ads for more coins to upgrade ,nice game"
1,Can’t get in friends server,It just so bad and every time you watch a ad 6/10 times there is no x so you can’t even get out of the ad and when you leave and rejoin it makes it where you never watch the ad and it reset you battle and I play this dumb game for a while and it all most impossible to beat the 2nd level
5,Average gamer guy gohn,"It’s simple for my dumb brain, cute little graphics, fun strategies, no ads unless you choose to select the buttons that say ad. Love the creator"
5,Arizona mum,"There aren’t 700 things to learn. Just slow, satisfying progress. Also the graphics are cute."
1,Warrior20242024,"in this game it's like everything is the other way around, all those upgrades that you buy for real money seem to improve your enemies and not your army. even if you see that the soldiers are the same, both yours and the enemy's, the enemies are still stronger. this is an elementary pumping of money from players"
3,angry scam app,"I like the game, there are just so many adds that it becomes boring. I would pay not to have adds if that was an option."
1,Disgruntled-User69,"The game is designed to knock you down then pick you up up by having you watch Ads for rewards you actually need, and then that doesn’t even work cause when you get the item you desperately need the game will throw you into another scenario you can’t possibly win"
1,Afoz6669,Absolute garbage. Looked good initially but filled with ads and you literally need to just waste a couple hours of your time losing levels at the beginning of each era to gain coins to upgrade stuff to even make it even playable. What a waste of what could have been such an easy simple game.
5,Emperorsnewclothesarefake,What if you could upgrade your characters with better weapons & armor. I know thats alot of script to type…
1,Hugsh46526,"Why am I being matched up with timeskip runes players when I only have the first rune tree unlocked? There is a zero percent chance for me to even reach 10th place against those players. I was only one timeline 3 when some dude was already on 17 only 30 minutes into the event, uninstalling this trash gg."
5,FOXYMYFAV,"I literally have the max trooper (the horseback) and I almost won my first battle and It was at 17, before the AI sent like. 4000 troops at me and I lost  In conclusion, please fix this bug."
5,:)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!z,The game can be frustrating but when you see that VICTORY it is just a surge of happiness and excitement this game is probably the second best game out of my like 50 games I just LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
2,Matroplex Matt,"The ads in this game are worse than any other game I e played.  And there is no option to play as free, so good luck being frustrated. The game takes a long time to progress too, especially if you don’t watch the ad boosts. Not worth it tbh."
1,Xx_OOF_xX,"Cheaters are miles ahead of people in the race mode, and there’s no way to catch up and claim the same rewards. I’ve seen pics/videos from people who have spent hundreds of $$$ on the game, yet they still cannot reach the same score as the rampant exploiters. Check the reddit to see more proof"
1,Celk18,Minute long ads ruined the game. 30 seconds should be the max length for watching an ad. Having to sit throw an entire minute long ad made this game unplayable since watching ads is the only way to really progress. I’m not trying to spend more time watching ads than even playing.
3,Bepizila,"Would be 10x better if there was a paid option to get rid of all ads, for example the legend slime game has said option where it acts as an ad skip and eliminating all ads."
1,TruthfulThumb,"The events need 10 achivents but the last one is get all ten so you can’t get it, I paid for the Jonas event pass twice now and got cheated from the garbage programming of 9/10 instead of the 9/9 that the developers wanted, fool me twice and I’m done with youre ad to pay to play GME"
5,MEDOGGO8,I mean there’s almost no ads it real relaxing it may look like a clone but no I play this for like 20 a day good definitely should play
5,bghghgffffffghggjggg,I play during car rides and it doesn’t use internet buy so you can try it out
5,Imagointakil,There is no easy way to make this game go faster. Which is great! It takes time and patience and I love it!
5,Bad but better,Just download this game this is the 2nd best no wifi and ad game I’ve seen before minecraft and it has no problems with it
5,gr it ghjdj,"Interesting game that surprisingly has no forced adds, but uses them to give extra rewards"
5,Trixie598,This game is just awesome really easy to pass time I’ve been playing all morning keep up the good work!’
1,OzSwanky,The game starts you off losing none stop unless you wanna watch ads or put money into it. Not a good way to get players to stay after playing for the first time.   At least the old school original started you of fairly instead of setting you up to fail right off the rip.
1,AnthonyS001,Gameplay would be decent if it wasn’t just focused on forcing you to watch ads to make any meaningful progress. Getting tired of games making ads part of the core gameplay rather than optional. Because there is no ‘option’ when it’s integral to your game to progress.
2,PatmanO,"Game started out great. Battles, double coins for watching ads. Reward system reasonably fair. Now more than half the time when I watch an ad to double reward, when the ad ends, the app locks up. No reward - not even the base level coins I earned. I’m done."
3,jadubandmal,"I couldn’t believe that this game never threw ads at me. Although entertaining, eventually its the same grind at every level with just different skins - which grew too tiresome to keep going."
3,TK721721721,"New update does not recharge keys, and when you win the rotating badges it does not add them to your stack of badges. Need to add more content. Make the races issue some type of reward for each timeline you pass."
4,D3AZY,This game takes the legendary computer game Age of war and makes the process way longer and rewards you for watching ads. They know they’re doing.
5,cirkel_k,Around timeline 23 it gets hard difficulty x43
5,Thoughtyoushouldknow#,Just want to let you all know you game has been ripped off by “time battle war”
4,1236269953156;)&,Completed both Deep Sea and Chess Events w/ 9/10 tasks completed. The task to get the badge for 10th tasks says to complete all other tasks which I completed or is there some hidden task to get the badge?
5,MC’S response,This game is so fun I’ve played this game for like 2hrs I love it graphics are amazing not to realistic and not to poor just how I like it love it I wanna get to the Godzilla part 🙂🙂
5,Roar of the lion 56,One of the best games I’ve ever played im addicted to it its my go to game so I think everyone should try it
1,ILOVESWW2HISTORY,"So the game is fun and all but one thing that pisses me off the most is when the other side has like 40+ guys you barely have 3 out, its just unfair. Like the game definitely needs some sort of rework to balance it instead of just 100 guys rushing out when you can barely muster up 4 guys at most."
1,Mouse200707,"In app purchases are way too expensive for what they offer and you can’t do much without them. Also, even if you pay you will still need to watch ads to keep the game advancing at an interesting pace. Developer is ruining their own fame because of how greedy they are."
3,games with your mom,"Only complaint, it takes so long to get to the next level would be nicer than speed up the food"
5,get yhhsjekjah,Very fun and addicting very entertaining without this game I will be bored out my mind I would play more fortnight if this game didn’t exist Ty for making very fun.
4,Holy macornoi,I rate 4 stars because it cures boredom and gives u a choice to watch an ad or not for a reward instead of just frequently giving you them
1,Jmtempss,"Sure, you don’t need the ads to play, but it makes it much more bearable. I wouldn’t mind that aspect if the game wasn’t the exact same thing over and over again. The units have the same damage model every “evolution” so there’s absolutely no strategy involved. Got boring after a day."
5,That’s is all,It’s exactly what it look like the game is so much fun I did not expect it to be like this but it is so fun once you get the hang of it.
5,Fjghjkghyfgc,I’m very pleased to see this game is exactly what it claims it is and does it’s simple concept very well! A game like this is hard to find these days.
2,Broseph828393,"Game concept is decent, but they’ve purposely slowed down gameplay to me it feel sooo slow. Then they acknowledge this by adding the option to speed time up by watching an ad! It’s not a buff to your units, just speeds everything up to a normal pace."
5,Rundw02,This game is very good I’m on timeline 2 and I have things to say  When I first downloaded this game I expected the average ad apocalypse every 5 seconds But nooooo it’s not like that you chose to watch ads that are beneficial to you  Sure the first and last battles are grindy but after you get past those you level up pretty fast  So yeah great game
5,Matthew gaming1526,"I love this game so far it’s a 5 star in my opinion  It’s so fun when you win your first game and I’ve had this game ever since Nov,6,23"
4,hfjchbhj,We love the game it’s just that the progression is extremely slow and difficult
4,rexyboygamer,"Game doesn’t force any ads on you, but it makes it easier to advance. I am about 2 hours in and still on level 1."
1,captainT xxt,I’ve only been playing less than 30 minutes. I watched one ad and it was a deceptive fake Mr beast ad. Then my second ad I watched glitched the game so bad it made my phone have to be closed and restarted. When I reopened I didn’t have the rewards from either so I’m not willing to do that again
4,kdjdjeiws x,The game is really good maybe like a 2x speed button but I can’t seem to make it past battle 6 because it’s like they have an unlimited amount of ammunition
2,logical genie,That was a major seeking point for me. They flash this review that says the opposite because they know the ads are so frustrating. Then they go and make you sit through ads after the levels end.
5,Funstyles,"I like it, it’s nice for long car trips. The game is a bit hard also it doesn’t Lie in the ads"
5,Emmy17035,At first you don’t know what’s happening but as you get used to it your a pro at the game that’s all from me.
3,Leon Arklight,"I would give this game 5 stars as it’s hard to mess this concept up. It’s reminiscent to games I played growing up, however 11 dollars for permanent 1.5x is ridiculous and the audacity to even list that price is baffling."
1,osrswoky,"Absolutely terrible game. It doesn’t matter how many upgrades you do, the game will always spawn an inconsistent amount of enemies to combat what you spawn in hopes you will watch ads. There’s a daily challenge to watch 5 ads to get tokens, so if that tells you anything, this game is just a pay to win. Deleted!"
5,SuperHank6474,"No ads unless you want more coins, very fun gameplay, just exactly how the ad shows."
5,Ink Ninja YT,"It looks a bit weird/a clone at first, but in reality it is an amazing strategy game with many possibilities and overall an amazing game to pass time."
1,fjanr cn,"Game is fun to farm, but evolution ruins it entirely. When you get enough currency to evolve it resets all of your entire progress, so all the time you had spent improving your resource production and base health just gets thrown away. Such a dumb concept, not worth playing if I don’t get to maintain the benefits of what I worked so hard to obtain"
1,Bigmeaty465838,They have to have bots writing reviews. No way this gets 4.5 stars. This game is just ad after ad. It’s the same waves over and over and you have to watch 1000 ads to even get close to evolving. Don’t waste your time. This game was made to receive ad revenue and that’s it.
5,KingJLeGreat,You may see that this just looks like your old boring regular ad well your wrong this game is amazing 5 stars
5,😒😒😡😡😡😒,I’ve been looking around lately and need a good game to play once I saw this game I knew this would be fun and I’m loving it 🥰 keep up the good work!!!
3,Scuba1997,"The units aren’t intuitive enough to know who shows up first. Ads mostly, but not always give your promised bonus. Should give option of going for highest health, lowest health, weakest, or most dangerous enemy."
4,gffuinvvgy474?&,But man it takes awhile to beat the first level. I don’t know if it was me being bad but it took me a bit to complete. Long game and takes awhile.
3,Reviewing Chicken,The removed the ads where you can speed up the game. So it’s not as fun to play since it takes forever for a match
5,Saul_38769!!,It’s hard at first but later on you get way better in my opinion it’s good
5,El start,I love this game already and it’s easy to overcome the first levels and level up your units!
5,Jackixor,shows adds every match but you can just decline its a very fun game
5,Dallidog,So most games when u see ads for a game it’s nothing like it but this game doesn’t lie. Super addicting
2,Irritated Now2,Fun game but constantly glitches when after watching a video in increase your points. It’s frustrating cause you need to restart the game and you don’t get credit for the level you just beat!
4,More gameplay and lots of adds,Also can you make the ai have the same count down as we do that will make the game more balanced.i love the cute art
1,shutupidontwantnickname,"Completely ads driven game . If you don’t spend real money or watch pop up ads , you can’t progress. Download to try it it out and I can’t go pass 1 level after losing 20 or more tries straight no win .   We play game to enjoy . Don’t become a farming animal for this game developers"
5,Tabby422,"The whole thing is great, and I haven’t even finished it yet it’s one of the most addicting fun games I’ve ever played"
4,Ryan4769,It  Think the game is awesome I just wish you did t lose all your money after each upgrade
5,most names were taken,No forced ads
1,i not super man,I have to watch a lot of advertisements. otherwise you will get bored with the result very quickly. just don't waste your time. Progress will not be saved for the next development. advertising for this game is blocked by la tik tok. I think this game was made on the knee. just don't waste your time.
5,JackRussM,"This game Is fun when you’re bored because it relaxing, and every battle you get something new"
5,A. T. Brown,Great game when you just want to chill and do something a bit different for a minute.
5,j a c k s o n s i m m o n s,First of  I love trial and error games like this. Another reason no Wi-Fi big plus for me. Great game would recommend to new players
5,Agent O.D.,It’s really a good game so you like upgrade your meat generator also you can buy different types of troops and evolve
5,Foodisgooder,This game is really fun and good for car rides at first it takes a while but it’s really fun
2,ChubbiestApple,"This game is fun for about 1-2 hours then you hit a massive paywall and I mean massive. You need to spend money to unlock cards to improve troops, otherwise you will lose until you wait for your free ads to watch every day refresh."
5,jdkskdnddkssjsjsndndjdkdkdk,I love this game so much and it doesn’t have ads but if you want to double your coins you can this is so much fun.
5,Alizé Vasquez,It is just so fun I can not stop playing it because I am bored so I just like to play it all the time
5,Vaper8,This is a fun game that doesn’t force you to watch ads but you can for double gold
5,Eddie03827,Loved the fact that they don’t force ads on you like every other game.
2,GriffinD123,"Could be a fun little game if it wasn’t so slow and grindy. Videos show you having guns, but that’s end-game content. I’ll still play it if I don’t have internet connection, a book, or someone to talk to. Not hard just kinda dumb."
1,Avirex Ace,Don’t believe those reviewers who say you don’t have to watch ads - you do! When I WANT to watch an ad for double money there is a 70/30 chance the game will freeze and then I have to restart it and get 0 from my last battle!  Avoid this game! I would give it 0 stars if I could!!!
5,Best game ever on the wro,It is fun but hard and it does not make you watch adds
3,hdhqjsbesjjxw,“Are you stuck? Try playing zombie rush”   Gets stuck on zombie rush. Now what? 😂
5,Rip a dip,If you get past the first level the rest is a breeze once you get to the farm age  Please STOP showing me royal match pllease
2,ToothlessPlayzz,"When playing the game, there are multiple UI issues. In the upgrade menu, you cannot upgrade the base health. And during battle, the Watch Ad button covers the player’s base health. The enemy’s base health is sometimes covered by the task UI."
5,sammm iiii ammmm,I’ve been playing for the past few years
1,LemnHz,"Turned off my WiFi and service so I didn’t have to sit through the 900 ads bc WOW is this an ad machine if I’ve ever seen one. Kill 2 set enemies, level up production by .2 percent at a time, ad rinse and repeat. Progression is designed to keep you watching ads. Terrible game, literally an ad revenue machine dressed up as age of war."
2,MrSoker15,"You’ll not get far without watching ads to progress, even the daily quests to get skills and spells require “watch 5 ads”. Game is fun but progress isn’t possible you’ll be stuck in 60 minutes"
5,Eaton Knass,Great game with a playful art style and I haven’t gotten an ad yet and I’ve been playing for an hour.
3,JohnZaf,"As much as I enjoy the game, and there is no requirement for Ads, 60% I watch an Ad for its perk, I simply can’t exit it and have to restart the game. No reward, no benefit, just nothing. It’s so frustrating."
1,Akapplez,"Look for real reviews. Every step of the way this game aggressively tries to make you watch ads and without the ads, the gameplay is painfully slow pace. If you aren't ready to watch ads half the time then this game is not for you."
2,The Winter Fox,"The game itself is fun, but the events they put in are so frustratingly difficult that the only way to get anything out of them is to spam watch ads or sink money into leveling up abilities. It was enough to convince me to uninstall it and spend my time elsewhere."
2,Why is this so hard apple,You just keep doing the same thing over and over and get nowhere. Eventually sure you will level up enough but until then you do the same thing for way to long.
3,doctor dank420,"so the game is basically age of war, or battle cats, which i knew when i downloaded it. but while those games have some upgrades for your units, this one is so reliant on upgrading with coins outside of the actual level that it’s totally implausible that you’d beat the first few levels without first grinding coins by losing them several times. as a result, what strategy there is within the levels feels superficial."
1,supercllsucks,The game pretty much is you watching ads until you have enough coins to beat the level. Then when you beat the level all your coins reset and you can watch more ads again on the next level!
5,Me is gabe,This is a very fun game at my house I’m always so frustrated but when I play this game it helps me calm down.
1,takethisfawkingnickname,"I don’t know what it is with this app but at least 75% of the time after or during an ad to boost your hard work, the game suddenly crashes and erases all of said hard work. This game has crashed at LEAST ten times in the matter of half an hour."
1,Cinnaman69!,"Progression is possible without advertisements, however it takes a drastically larger amount of time to progress without them. So slow in fact that it is not fun to play without the advertisements giving you some type of boost."
2,Lucien Blackfyre,This game could be fun but it’s just an ad factory with a game built around it. First few stages you’ll spend more time watching ads than playing. Then you’ll still watch ads but with a little more game play in the mix
1,alexthepers0n,honestly for the first hour it’s really fun but after that it’s all basically the same gameplay and it becomes very stale very fast. it’s even worse though because as you progress the AI opponents power expands exponentially and it takes too long to progress.
2,Korrupt Gon,Game was ok until I figured out the level progression never changes especially on the event stages it takes forever to level while the Ai can overwhelm you before you can make any progress
3,Skies5800,I think the game could definitely be better if the meat spawn was a bit faster and it’s cost to upgrade it other then that it’s not bad
1,Lettucebomb,The progression is very slow. You’re mostly sitting through boring ads waiting for a x2 bonus per failure or victory and then the next wave will wipe you out. There are other games that are way more fun and rewarding that this one.  It’s only good if you like to sit around watching endless ads.
4,Zanedeu,Fun I played hours without being forced to watch ads and you could play the entire game without watching ads it’s fun
5,Thewanderingsensei,Great game. Reminds me of similar games but fun and you work hard for getting up there.
5,"Nugget,",I like the coins because you can unlock more Agis and increase the speed and health of your base. That’s what I like.
5,hammerheadsharks!,This game is really good and I think a lot of people would also like it
4,dino poo poo,person and it’s a simple game it just gets a little repetitive
1,Weatherman Jake,"Slow to no progress without watching ads over and over or purchasing in app purchases. You actually spend more time watching ads than playing the game. I know that’s the point, but if you don’t want to spend $ don’t bother downloading."
1,Cmonste21,"The whole point of the beginning of a game is to get people to like it, but all this one does is make you want to uninstall.  Only way to have some little fun is to watch a ton of adds.  Don’t get how people who make games with this way to make money get good reviews other than botting"
5,monster 1239687,I just started and the more you play it the more you enjoy it
1,Dee69!!!!,You can’t beat the first level even after tons of ads and playing it repeatedly. Far too little resources earned in the game and it takes forever to power up don’t play it’s obviously geared towards making you either spend money or watch a hundred adds.
4,Kxcya,This a good game overall and fun. I would like to see more updates such as being able to across previous civilizations.
5,ppppppppoduffyfhhdudjxh,"This is so fun and hilarious because the little people, but you should make the so not to smart so a 4.5/5 good"
5,CTFlint,"It’s so cool, and you can strategize, and release hordes of your units (warning: satisfying) and reach other timelines. Very fun!"
5,Bchotizgkxhkxhckhchkchdkxgk,This game is so fun cause it barely has ads only when you want double coins also i won snd destroyed a base it was so fun
3,Life jam,"It’s a pretty good game. It’s not really good but it’s alright. But I think they should make the game easier, it’s kinda hard. Idk if that’s just me or no. Also there’s no music in the game, there’s just hitting noises and that’s it, but it is a kinda solid game."
4,tempxxxxxxxxxx,Can we get an option to remove ads for like 2 dollars
4,More Matches!,"This is a great game, and I really dig the leveling system, but early game progression takes far to long, many ppl on TikTok say the same thing. Fun but progression takes eons! Overall great game"
5,aaaaaaaa12303644,so I got tired of the adds so I downloaded and I am not disappointed it’s fun and cute it’s calming to it passes time I really recommend
4,ClammyFoot1738,Everything is fine in my opinion the only thing that bothers me is the food i respect the grind but I want it faster I want to grind faster
4,IsRooster26ok,"Very fun game, as well as easy to understand. My only issue is how slow progression can be, but my suggestion is just try new strategies."
5,Callie Spatkman,Make sure to get this game
4,Big man56,Listen I like how the game progresses but at the first stage it’s way to hard so let us add armor to the warriors for a practice and when beat them you go to the first game  From not saying
1,H00l1g4n420,Can’t say if the game is any good or not because it completely closes itself out every time I tried to click “battle”   Tried at least 5 times then restarted my phone and tried 3 more times and gave up already uninstalled
1,new card is trash,all though this game is my fav right now ill have to say the bundle for the event $24 isnt good what so ever it feels the same as before buying the bundle and the 50% and 100% barely did a difference and the restore purchase button is no where to be found but u claimed to have added one smh i want a refund honestly if im not getting what i paid for 100% more or even the tuna itself being the same speed the only good thing was 800 potions and that was soon wasted on horrible abilites that do no good for the event
5,WOWYOU1,You will spend hours playing this game its addicting and doesnt force ads on you!
5,yve0818,The thing that i mostly love about this game is that its free to play and you don't need wifi to play the game so it’s perfect!
2,Loljjfhg,"Played it for a few days, progression is slow, and only seems to get slower as you go. It need more playability, see updates coming out but nothing gets added. Ive seen ads for enemies that aren’t even in the game."
3,abryant2330,Love the concept however the movement and progression is at a snails pace. Makes this game much less enjoyable even after watching ads for additional speed and coin multipliers.
2,Cytcytycuyctu,"Wouldn’t recommend the game. Listen to all the bad reviews, the ones saying it’s grindy are stupid. Sure I like to grind games out but that’s cos the grind itself is fun and the reward is worth it. There’s pretty much no reward for what you think you are grinding for."
3,* I was in a meeting,"Takes too long to complete a level but after that, it’s pretty good developers, please make it a little bit shorter and a little bit not harder"
5,GOATED OG,There’s no Ads unless you choose to watch them
5,Just like the adds,Just like the adds I love the game rlly works the mind to come up with statistics to win the game and just overall fun game
2,Skism007,"Insanely, insanely repetitive. Ads are optional, but good luck getting anywhere without watching nearly every single one. And when you finally get strong enough to win a battle, you get to start all over again from near nothing. Yay."
5,xodasox,"I wish the coins would build up faster, but still best"
1,No one gonna read this 😞,"The game would be great and very fun IF it didn’t take so long to get a 0.02 upgrade so that after 50 years you can beat battle 1. I am grateful that there are no forced ads but a lot more time is wasted trying to get +1 health as an upgrade. Also, the AI you have to beat has such a huge advantage."
2,DapiBlue,"It’s a game built to force you to watch their ads. You can definitely play without watching ads, but it takes up too much time. It’s a silly marketing scheme for them to generate revenue and I’m not for it."
1,Hufenator,"When watching an ad to get 2x coins, the app freezes so I’ve just wasted all that time and have to do the mission over again. It’s the Solitaire Cash ad. The ads are random so I won’t know if the app is going to glitch until after I’ve chosen to double my coins"
5,HotDommy,I was supposed to go to bed early but then I downloaded this while laying down. Now I’m rushing to get to work. Lol
5,Mommahen5,This just an amazing game to calm my mind and to just strategize and it is not pay to win and NO ADS unless you choose so
1,jkwoqokdiejjwjnd,"The beginning is a really slow grind to encourage you to watch ads to speed it up. The ads freeze the game after you watch them, making you lose your regular reward on top of the bonus you should get from the ad."
1,RaymondC1627,"I don’t understand how they designed this game, i how even know how to describe how bad this game is. You download this game and you just sit there watching your little warrior getting killed, over and over.  Yeah try this game, and I bet you will deleted it in 5 mins like me."
4,milliepoo 🌸💕💅🏻🏐🍑,It’s very slow and also how when you first start playing you go against level 500 and that’s a but intense but ok? Anyhow I love it so so much! 💕💕💕💕💕🌸🌸🌸🌸😏😏💅🏻💅🏻🏐🏐🏐
5,🤪😅😜😜😚😜😂😙😙😙,Amazing
5,Highlandcow2013,When I saw the add I was like I need it so I took a screenshot of the name and got it I play it and listen to music and sing and it’s so fun
4,Hap1977,The game is so hard in the beginning you have to buy something OR play for a while
4,gamer9001,"Great game, i really like it. I do think that making it faster would make it really fun. Maybe also making the progression faster"
3,Fjdykckncjk,The game has a good base but is overall lacking in content. Another gripe is not automatically going to the next era after beating the previous one. It’s a stupid mechanic to “buy” the next era in the first place.
2,person1286,"The game, well fun in concept, is completely unbalanced, at least in the beginning, and nigh impossible to progress without watching ads(I mean, one of the quests is literally “watch 5 ads”)."
3,suchibot100,It’s fun but it’s laggy and freeze’s on me a lot and when I get a lot of coins and click double it freezes and I have to close it but when I get back I don’t get my coins I get nothing :(
1,hjghaghea;gj,"This game only exists to generate ad revenue. The grind is ridiculous! The battles are a loop of losing, then watching an ad to lose slightly less, to upgrade slightly, to lose, to watch an ad to lose slightly less, to upgrade slightly…rinse and repeat. Hours later and no real progress.   DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME."
2,henry_5678,The progression is not very balanced as there isn’t much strategy to deploying different units just ensuring you have enough units to deploy and it’s easier to watch ads for 2x money and go to the next evolution than learning ways to win
5,Budderssssss1234321,"No adds, I appreciate that homie"
5,LaCroixFanboy,"Clean graphics, no ads unless you want to get coins and whatnot. Overall, one of the best on the app store"
1,dead african yoyos,"It’s fun time waster, but the sheer amount of ads you are watching to progress at a decent rate makes this game quite miserable looking back on my week of playing it.  Going to delete, but will stay on my radar if they move away from the ad progression model."
5,Anonymous to to to to to,I did not know what this was about until I got to space age I was so happy it’s the really best game I’ve ever played
3,6:7:!:,"I like the game but I don’t like how they put you in a position where you have to watch ads, and the little amount of things you can buy at the store"
1,al™,"This game has the appearance of a strategy game, yet it lacks substantial strategic elements. The gameplay is uninteresting, repetitive, requiring no mental effort or skills; instead, it demands time and continuous ad-watching. It feels more like a ""time-consuming, uninteresting tool to help the creator earn advertising revenue"" rather than a genuine game."
3,WarrenPQ,You hit certain points where it becomes overly ridiculous to win and then flop to too easy to win. Makes it frustrating and boring
5,Connoreviewed,One of those 1/100 mobile games that actually turn out to be good
2,Cypher_Loop_Mullet14,Don’t use your money for the points they do not roll over when evolving! Developers need to do better what is the point on having micro transactions if we can’t keep our points!!!!!
1,Fredyhemoo,"Paid for a PERMANENT 2x game speed feature because default was too slow.  Devs removed the feature and replaced with something I did not want and would not have bought.  Total bait and switch, do not recommend giving them any $$$"
5,Silas829,Base starts of bad then you get coins to make it better and then the people who try to get your base get stronger
2,Andy Domt,Interesting game with some neat features and animations. But it can be repetitive. However it forces the player to watch Ads just to get “coins” or whatever the currency is for the current event.
5,基基大可爱,This game is good I love it but why off to a bad start when losing waves on a streak like ATLEAST make it easier? Still I’m loving it.
5,legend of slime is cool,okay so when i was new and when i was loosing i hated it but now im happy and i love this game sooooo much and the levels get harder and harder so best game
5,Emani Bootz,I thought it was gonna be wack cause it was an ad but then I downloaded it and now my friend hates me. I’m addicted.
3,ColdFury1,"It’s fun at the start, but towards the end it gets really boring. I use to enjoy the racing event, but now the match making is really bad."
5,daryosghf,This game is very good just if they could make it so we could go out and change or region or evolve
1,Wheelerf5,"If you’re interested in this game after seeing one of their ads, forget about it. The footage from the ad is not part of the game at all. It’s completely false advertising. The game itself is extremely boring, and consists of pressing a button and watching ads."
1,Arid1111,The progression is INCREDIBLY slow. You have to play non stop for 2 days before you can even beat the first battle. It’s rigged against you every step of the way. The enemy can summon groups upon groups of enemies at once while you can only summon one guy every 20/30 seconds. This game is trash.
5,Sarah😘😇,"I absolutely love how the characters look, they are absolutely adorable! This is also a fun game, and I downloaded it yesterday!"
1,Reviewguy709,Let me start by saying I enjoy this game. But I spent 2 minutes watching an ad that never ended for an extra 27 meat. The ad glitched and did not let me exit it I had to close out the game. Losing my 2 minutes and the 27 meat I watched the ad for. Will return when ad is gone. Some type of castle taker game
5,Ellison:),The graphics are really cute I love I would recommend for 7 and up the only gore is some brown spots on the floor that resemble remainings but it is great
1,R0bo44,"Played for 30 minutes, didn’t even make it past the first level. Either watch ads to level up quickly or play the same level on repeat over and over and over and over again."
2,CreedOfficial,I love the type of game u guys have in mind but unfortunately I absolutely hate what u got if that makes sense. Its so slow paced and it rewards the player so little. Not only that theres no diversity or anything that makes the game enjoyable…
5,Woweverynameistaken55,"So far, it’s been a fun, simple game. It can’t be difficult at times but it’s still a good game."
2,Connore573,"The beginning of the game is a bit easy, I suppose to lure you in. After a few hours though it become a real grind. It’s has a lot of mechanics to pressure into watch ads."
3,Girthy Gibs,If your gonna force ads at least add a option to buy no ads. So annoying to have ads pop up in your face.
5,zènvfgn,This game is very fun I recommend and if ur having trouble with the cavemen levels just spawn as many Dino riders as possible that’s how u win ;)
3,sarafina625,I’m not happy that they got rid of the speed boosts ! :( this game is way too slow without it :( I’m still addicted to this game but idk how much longer till I’m sick of it
1,Jermiahsss,"The progression is way too slow to be able to do anything it needs an update to where the first level isn’t, their cave is 500 and. You have to work your way up it’s absolutely ridiculous please do something about this"
4,Mr.MASTER PLAYER!,"Ok game, and you’re not forced to watch ads but if you want to get through fast the game you do just have to watch ads"
5,Serenity_ate,"It’s a great game I could play this all day. It’s fine, Miss challenging. You learn how to like do strategies to defeat, the other people."
4,TorcheeSmorchee,This is an excellent time consuming game   The rewards system is a little slow but overall great past timing game
1,Malsamkreda,This was one of my favorite games until they got rid of the option to buy blue potions for skills with gems. It makes the game boring and impossible. My husband didn’t update the game and is still able to buy them
5,grim reaqer,I’m still really fun but a little to hard
1,SeriouslyItsTaken,"Cheaters are using Ai to keep playing the game 24/7 and abusing the event. I cannot get near 1st place due to “Madara” playing for 16 hours straight. Ridiculous that this game doesnt have a feature, after 1 hour you should need to prove you are the one playing. No human can play this game for 16 hours straight"
5,Miller strunk,This is a good game you should make more updates and more for each age like more troops
1,Nickname111111223,Game was fun in the begging but then became aggravating.  The computer put you in no win situations and the only thing left to do was watch their stupid ads over and over again and still couldn’t earn enough money to win an un winnable situation.   Not fun when the deck is stacked against you.
5,Jason Stotts 256,"It is nice and simple except when to  Level up To a different time it cost like 3,000 coins"
1,42weeeeeeeeee0,At the end of Timeline 2 you need to grind so much. It takes millions of coins to upgrade meat production by .2 unless you watch every AD its going to tale at the minimum 2x as long. Also why is the speed up multiplier only 1.5x thats so little. Why randomly 1.5x when everything else is 2x thats a bit dumb.
3,92759@7484)164,It has good stuff and all but why does the enime get all the good cooldowns Dino’s and more when all we have are cavemen and you can’t put it hammburger style (it’s when you make the side shorter)
5,Don’t really like Roblox,It’s a five
1,UniqueReviewerName,Game is designed to get you to farm ads or spend a ton of time to progress rather than use skills. You just get stuck farming the same level over and over and losing with no hope of winning or watching ads or spending money. Not a real game.
1,Grobatraz,Don’t get this game. The game doesn’t give you enough gold in game or the currency to get cards anywhere near enough. I paid the 15 bucks for triple gold and that only got me a couple of lvls before I was having to play a round 3 or 4 times to upgrade a tiny food boost.
5,easdfres cf,"Easily the best game ever, it is slow at the beginning but it is SOO FUN! I love everything from the sprites to gameplay to physics and systems, 100% good"
1,wrykas,"Game is too repetitive. The only thing that changes is the enemy spawn rate. Ads for first part of game are 10sec long, then once you pass the first level they go to 30sec+. Dont buy anything from this game until you’ve beat the first few simple worlds."
2,silent striker161,"I began to like the the game to a point…. Once you reach battle 5 goodluck, you can’t win against the battle five enemies without traveling to the next time line AND EVEN THEN you can’t travel unless you win battle 5!"
5,AsaNick hoh,Second level is great
5,aaailpq,I’ve had this game a couple of months and I’ve been hooked
1,Renonick55,Was having a lot of fun with this game until the last update that scaled up the enemies and now they’re 1000x my units. Getting a bunch of cards didn’t help. Feels weird that they added the blue potion but didn’t retroactively give the ones that were missed.
4,Aaroniscool1,The adds are too long but everything else is good
5,dhjskscidd,It doesn’t make you watch any adds and it’s exactly how it looks
2,Allison Risher,Title explains the reason behind the rating. I love this game but i am unable to scroll down to upgrade the building and the weapons. Its very unfortunate. Maybe an upgrade in the future would help/address this issue??
4,Anonymous person 🫥433332,I’m not a patient person so don’t mind my review that it’s a bit slow.
3,Pleb2000,Getting +food% production just makes the cost of your units scale up as well. Who cares if you are getting more food if the troops also cost more… what’s the point?
5,13adger,I never write reviews. This game is a fun waste of time.  I love it. I say give it a try even though it’s not super exciting. It’s fun.
3,random nickname3,"If you have the time to progress throughout the ages, the game can get fun. However, the early game is VERY slow and just isn’t fun, and even the ads barely help the progression."
5,Tiffany135j,This game is very entertaining and fun to play  there are no ads unless you want extra money for the game
5,Emett C,"Even though not very high graphics, still very fun and give it five star raining cause it’s very fun"
3,boomtimer,Some adds do not work and crash the game (White Out Survival) and you end up losing what you just fought for. If they vetted the ads better I would give a higher score
1,JustinIsDisappointed,You play battle 1 over and over and nothing changes. The walk extremely slow and you win. I don’t understand the point and it would take me forever to get 2000 coins to go to the next level. No ads but this is terrible
5,N0ooooooby,If I could give it a 100 star review I would the game is so fun and hard at the start I had to evolve to beat the cave men
4,cheenie0077,"Great simple fun game, it’s just got a slow start. I’m with everyone else and wish it had a 2X speed button"
2,marty dj837,"First off, your app opponent is able to spawn not depending on their number of food just like you. They spawn in large groups and completely destroy your soldiers easily. And upgrading your food production speed doesn’t seem to help at all"
5,InvestorJoey,This game is a great game in my opinion because there isn’t adds that u can’t stop and it’s optional
2,Marie Strang,"This game feels unfinished. Progression is slow and boring because of that. Every level is the same. It’s just the same three units in each age that are increasingly expensive, and buying the food upgrade a bunch of times."
2,Some person who is not,It’s good but it starts you off in a impossible level I haven’t beaten the first one yet why can’t it start easy and teach you how to play and when you get a new time line it resets the food it’s like all that work was for nothing
5,✅✅✅✅✅✅🥸,"This game is amazing 🤩 if your looking for a game that challenges you then this is it,I personally play this game every single day I love it 😍"
5,M00N13GrayLovesPurple,"I love this game but I wish moving on in the game was easier, yet I still do love it. Lots of ads, but it’s worth it."
1,ThisWarriorsSUCK,Can’t even beat levels with IQ. Dev really isn’t it. Should fire himself. All you do it watch and wait for your money to go up. To “outsmart battles” you watch adds to double your money. It’s just time and watching. Whoever the devs is your pathetic and I hope you see this.
4,Super super hard game,For me unless you spend money on the game or watch a ton of ads you can not win
5,sfghuhfthhkbfde,I just got the app and I just got the farm age I have only had it four 1 hour
3,gdhnk,Progress is extremely slow the ai is very difficult to beat and it almost always has the upper hand
1,JAYCO_0,The new update must be a way of getting us to watch more ads I’ve upgraded my food timing to 45 mill it went from 117 for watching ads to 57 currently making the level I’m on impossible to complete unless I watch a ton of ads I like the new visuals tho lol
5,Jukeman1310,It’s a great game with a clear objective easy to understand nice evolvement but hard as the oppenet is always on the upper Hanes but overall is a great game
2,Lonegun2188,It could be a lot more fun if you could progress without the ads.  Trying to move forward with or without ads is time consuming.
5,xhfjdjd,I tried to stop playing this game but it is so much fun going through ages.
1,jeremyrjc,"There is no skill involved and simply serves to push you to watch ads. You don’t earn anything in the background, there is no incentive to play other than seeing the different characters. It’s more ad stuffed “games” that aren’t really games at all. Shame."
3,Celesteous,"Its slower paced growth and less amusing to watch. Great way to pass free time if you’re bored, but if you want something fun to play for hours on end, this isn’t it."
3,{<JJ 7>},"It’s sad that this game forces ads upon you. It’s actually a dope game, but I can’t tell if I play the game or spend more time watching ads. If you don’t wanna watch ads to progress in a game don’t bother."
5,Great for people like me,Fun its is very fun very very fun especially when your just doing nothing and want fun In that case this is the best and it is very fun
3,Moe stanler,The game is fun to progress through but is extremely ad driven.  It bogs the experience down a lot and makes it tedious.  A decent time waster of a game.
4,READ THIS ITS FOR PARENTS,The game overall is pretty good there are some ads but I would play it not gonna lie play it for sure
1,Moose100434,"The gameplay is basic, but its a mobil game so thats not bad by itself. What is absolutely unforgivable, is when you ‘evolve’ ALL your prior progress is reset. Meaning, all the ads you choose to suffer through to boost your loot is wasted time. There is no ‘grinding’ to get ahead. Its a bad design and makes the game unfun."
5,u gxvh,"Great game for when you’re bored, only add are the ones you decide to watch"
4,will i am254454,It’s fun but I wish you always had the ad option to help speed up the game.
5,dogcat😻😸,"Love the art style, no pay to win, no forced ads, works without Wi-Fi, overall just nice :)"
5,WolfAtTheGate,A small game to kill a time by without spending thousands of dollars on your base.
5,MrBeast heheh,It’s better than I expected I would recommend it.
5,msmmsmsmsmsms,Had trouble on lvl make it easy next time
4,Ztcrkhfd2*68#5,The only thing is the adds everything else is fun though
1,Zero Fox,"This game is an ad trap. It's been designed to where you have no other choice but, to watch an ad every minute or so if you want to have even the slightest chance of being able to actually play it and get into the game. It's not a game you would wanna keep playing"
5,AAKABO,"Super addicting game. I have no complaints, but I would GLADLY pay a monthly fee for a no ad version. Please"
1,FloidTouch,"If you don't watch ads there's practically no way to progress. Between diminishing returns and extreme grind, there's just no point in playing this unless you're some kind of freak that actually enjoys watching ads constantly."
5,edjaybell,I can’t play but i’ll rate this 5 stars bc it looks like a good game
1,Zembar,Been playing for a bit. Was quite fun and enjoyable. Loved that it offered ads for bonuses but never forced them.   Now it pops up an ad after battle complete before I can even choose to watch for 2x’s money or not.   Shame.
1,ZenigenIphone,"Game is littered with ads, and no option to pay to remove them. Plenty of paying options for earnable currency that goes away on the next level though."
1,ghost party,"You will need to watch 73 ads just to pass the 2nd level. If not, then it’ll take you 146 games of the same button press 2 to 7 times>die>repeat. Game has so much potential, yet ruined with slow progression and constant ads to “fix” the issue."
1,Po Tadder,"After the first few rounds you get minimal ads, after that it forces ads in your face or pushes you towards buying something with real money. 7/10 with the minimal ads. Unplayable after they start pushing spending money."
1,Yoshis1324,No matter how much money you spend on upgrades and multipliers for troops. The math literally won’t let you 2 shot ground troops with arrows.  I’ve spent nearly 15 dollars and made sure to get this X multipliers and it doesn’t add up to make you spend more time watching ads
2,Hobbes92,You know a game is bad when its biggest draw-in is “for $11 you can play the game a *little* bit faster.”  The events are excruciating. I appreciate the variety in timelines. The game caps how much in game currency you can gain each day
1,Stewart92y,I really enjoy this game but the ads need to be fixed. Every time I go to watch an ad I have to physically turn the volume down on my phone otherwise the volume will play. I keep my phone on silent mode and it still plays.
5,Amba_d_best,Super fun I'm obsessed 😍! But I don't like that since the start we have to fight a level 500
5,5startttey,"The game has a great element of simplicity, and I enjoy that. But do yourself a favor and get an adblocker."
3,sudinorm,great at first. addicted for days. then it became way repetitive and slow. ads are completely voluntary which is nice.
5,🙃fix the game,This game is perfect for long car rides and when you are bored
4,Ggkughfyfin HD if in TV,This game is really fun and it doesn’t shove ads in your face every 6 seconds. I really like the character designs too.
5,Swag like Ohio1234,The first level is hard make it easy plz
4,smbeech,"This was a fun game, but now anything that requires an ad to obtain benefits won’t load the ads"
2,TheRed9,"The gameplay is ok, but each time you “evolve” it’s like everything resets. You can put time into generating a lot of resources, but then it goes back to painfully slow the next Age."
4,Jamo2024,This game is pretty addicting although a little boring and repetitive there are no adds you need to watch so that’s why I love it
2,angry99999999,Game is fun for the most part!  Too hard to advance without paying.  And too many ads to watch to get boosts.  Also I keep being shown I can summon cards but have no idea how it's not explained!
5,Lefoque80,"Guys the game is really awesome, however with this new update is reallyyyyyyy sloooowwwwww We need more speed!!! Please"
2,Quillams,I was competing in a race tournament. The most recent one that’s been released. It’s actually still going on at this very moment. I was watching an ad and I was on timeline three age 5 my game crashed and I went back to age 1 timeline 2
1,KerrodWill,"Wanted a fun idle/incremental game to play. This was super slow and kind of forces you to watch ads or buy currency to skip the slow game loop. I kind of put up with it until the daily mission was “watch 5 ads” like what? You should be embarrassed dude, that’s just bad faith right there."
5,Kai_12358,I absolutely love it and you don’t have adds unless you buy more coins! It’s really fun
3,ini_ubong,Options to attack and defend would help players call back their trips to regroup or simply buy time. This will help a lot of strategy players to use more tactics.
1,Whoopstock,There is no way to progress or enjoy this game even if you spend more time watching built in ads for help. It’s made to force you to watch ads but you gain no advantage for spending your time on ads that pay them money.
1,altra chad,The over all style and consent is really cool. but the only thing that needs fixing is the levels are really repetitive. if all the levels had different patterns and waves that would make this game a five star. But over all me and my dad had a really fun time playing this game
4,chester county cowgirl,The added dungeons and things to collect keep me interested more than I expected
5,steven24224,I would pay to remove ads
1,Chewy2024,The only way you can progress is by watching an ungodly amount of ads. I had it for about an hour and barely last 3 minutes if that before you get beaten. The gameplay isn’t interesting enough for it be worth all the ads.
5,AwesomeBob2,Ads are only for extras and when you choose
2,Garriahsa,1) touch anywhere during a reward ad and you’ll lose the battle’s rewards and the 2x rewards; 2) sometimes your progress is simply lost 3) so many ads…
1,Myrkwolf,"Spent a bunch of time playing this app the first day I downloaded it, then while I was watching an ad it forced me to watch it crashed and now the app won’t even stay open. Waste of time"
4,I'm a kid:),I couldn't pass the first level until 4 hours and I spent my hardest but the game is good I love it it's addicting
1,Jacobi_21153,Worst game I’ve ever played games are supposed to gradually get harder not beat you over the head the first time you open the app then to fall into the ad trap I watched an ad to get more power and the game locked my screen while it was still playing so lost AND DIDNT RECEIVE THE POWER
1,jojielmono,"I loved this game, it was fun, challenging, but possible, and didn’t require purchases. The most recent updates have broken the game and made the speed boost I purchase into a coin multiplier which is absolutely worthless at this stage. I want a refund for the speed boost…"
5,Mailboxlicker,"It’s very well balanced, can’t really find anything wrong about this game"
5,7&:!:7:&rujsudhdhd,It’s rly fun and I believe that it’s the perfect thing to play when you’re traveling
4,Neothegreat08,Its what you would expect from a game like this i love the fact ads aren’t forced though
5,linkkid09,From gameplay to RPG miss this is just good. It’s just good. There’s no other way to explain it except good.
2,Juggler22,Upgrades need to be cheaper or more powerful. This game literally is the slowest I’ve ever seen.  Upgrades that take a week to earn… or actually you only have 1 of 4 needed to make a upgrade.
1,Lj1164,Filled with ads and the AI has every advantage against you. You would have to watch ads or play for hours to beat the first level. It’s one of the worst games I have ever played. Just another garbage mobile ad game that the creators did not put any thought into
5,kati milled,It’s so fun for me and I love that you can upgrade I just think it’s so so so fun and you should get it
4,Logan Dalton,I like playing this game when I have nothing to do but don’t want to play any other games
2,ndidns ckf,"Fun dumb game, something to keep busy with but it seems like 1 in 3 ads freeze the game and I can’t get the reward I was trying to get and have to close the app, whether it was double money or the 1.5x speed."
2,bruhhhhhhh12315,"Ok, hear me out on this one. In the first battle it does so much and you have to fail x amount of times and that x is at least going to be more then 30 times, to get past level 1."
1,Thechibiplaya,The game goes from fun at first to extreme slow and unenjoyable very fast. It basically makes you watch a ton of ads unless you want to spend a crazy about of time grinding. Absolutely terrible model. Also extremely repetitive.
1,SWFL Game,"The ads will crash the game, especially the solitaire cash ad. Watch a video to double a winnings during a battle, or spin the wheel, or to get tokens from the store. The benefit is lost and not even the winnings will show up."
5,Origami12345PAPER,"No forced adds only choosing when you want them, also great game for a plane!!!"
5,Mink water,I love it there are no ads it’s not to hard to beat but not too easy
3,Royalties 2827,I have to wait at least two days so I can go to the next age and make it easier to please
3,the 7x,"I guess after a while you can do pretty good but it still is HORRIBLE,you can’t scroll through your power ups and it costs ALLOT of money to get stuff"
1,Meeeee()(()()((((()(,Actually could be a fun game but there’s almost no progression unless you watch ads or spend alot of money. You can’t even pay to get rid of the ads you just have to watch them. Trash would never recommend
5,gujjnhjjmmmmmmmmmjjhghffgvdrff,The game is so good if people say that it’s bad let them because I know that you are the best game in this world 🌍
3,Bbguy gyugbuygu h,It takes you like half the mach o yeah when you first battle you place is has 2 health were the enemy has 500 no joke
1,MeekoRockz,This game is insane you can even get an upper hand u always loses when u first start out there men are allowed to come out super fast and it’s is so slow u don’t earn very much coins to the point it makes the game not even fun to play because ur enemy overpowers you
2,rlandon8787,"Rate of progression is crippling to the fun of this game. Everything is ad based which is fine if it made an actual difference in game speed.  Make the rounds worth more money, or lower the cost of upgrades. Or cut the amount given to the PC enemy."
2,xxryooxx,First level is nearly impossible to pass unless you have tons of booster. The mob come out like crazy while you can barely muster up 2 troops to counter while they’re spawning 6 high end unit at once. Super imbalance
4,Destroyer2411,I like this game I just don’t like how slow the progression is. Yay for there not being ads after every level!
2,lemmejust,"Extremely slow, basically forcing you to watch adds to do anything, then literally forcing you to watch adds, u made 0 progress with more than 2 hours of play time lol"
4,shhebjd,Cool Free game that I really enjoyed playing and you might not mind it as long as you don’t mind watching ads
5,DDarkNiss,Never in my life did i think this game would be for me. Thank goodness i was wrong!
5,Mr.L not a teacher,The game is boring but fun at the same time I just beat the first level and I think it is fun
1,kweequak,"Game looks cool, but prepare to lose over and over again unless you’re willing to watch ads or give them money. You’ll keep losing after watching the ads, you’ll just lose a little bit less."
2,Jwhisen,"Very, very slow game designed to make you watch ads to get items to help you progress. Basically just the same thing over and over."
4,llllllllllllllllpplplplpl..,Just started playing and I am already fighting stuff that is way above my units and this is the first level
5,XVILLL,It’s a good time waster when I’m waiting for a project or an email to be turned in
4,gmoneyswag.com,Do you only get 1 video per day to boost your food count now? Used to be 2.
5,kayechw,Nice strategy!
5,Afromankill2000,Great game love playing on my commute to work glad Im not forced to watch ads.
5,Gymoney0629,So much fun to get of stress and ads not to bad really fun hope you get a lot of coins
1,haggardyo,"If you ever use the add feature which you pretty much need to for progression, expect to watch up to five minutes of the same add over and over before you can get back to the game"
1,SpencerGR,"Devs recently removed the option to 1.5x and 2x game speeds and tried to compensate those who bought it with something unequal. The game is simply not enjoyable for people who spent the money and got used to the higher speeds. Increase the speeds across the board, please"
5,Sawyer vaughn,Add planes or ship maps like on Cold War you could add bomber planes but overall it’s a sun game.
5,TROY43G,At first a could not know what to do and wasted 3 hours but then I tried a new tratade and got a victory
5,hello est,This game makes my dog very excited and he jumped out my car window and got hit by a 18-wheeler
1,Soggy Biscuits 001,"It’s not really a skill based game, it’s a grind game. The AI has every advantage of you always and even after playing an hour, you still won’t get one win in. You barely get any food and there is no good multipliers. Not worth the download."
1,Yosaiii,Developer got way to greedy with all the ads and forcing us to watch ads in order to do anything. Towards any kind of progression in the game fun little concept but basically a pay to win using ads. Ruined it completely.
4,bri diggity,Starts a bit slow but resource management makes the game interesting pretty quickly imo
5,cool person i think.....,The game is updated a lot which is good for good growing games and it is fun to go to new places and dungeons
2,stiffcliff,"You will see more ads than you will play the game. There's no option to buy an ad-free experience, so I don't recommend downloading this game."
1,Kouraji,After saving enough to pull 10 cards… was super disappointed because I got +35% bonus dmg to all units ….. and it didn’t work!! My unit still 1v1 the same unit kind and still die…. What give ? Are these cards bonus apply somewhere else? Or just bugged?
5,Slotsolayer,Best game ever when I saw the ads I really wanted it and when downloaded it it go super addictive
1,Xinix Xaxx,"All I saw was grind grind grind. I couldn’t win a match because the enemy had a base with 500 health and I had two. To get mine up, I needed coins. To get coins I had to win matches or at least lose well. After losing about 20 matches, I had almost half the coins I needed. Not worth the time and effort."
4,defdyer,If you choose not to spend and to grind it is long but fun and worth it
1,jackboi67,"You need to use a billion ads just get the first enemy down low. How do people like this? I get it’s trying make me angry so I play more, but it makes me want to uninstall the game instead. For the love god, don’t get this game I would give 0 stars if I even had the chance to."
4,Funnystarye2093,So the game is good in general but I just wish it was more like the adds. Other than that great game!
2,glitchy and fruatrated,The Solitaire Cash Ad glitches every time is comes up and freezes the game constantly. The glitchy adds are incredibly frustrating.
5,Rell10Kay,This is a very very fun game I just wish you guys have no ads and skills reloads that will make this game really awesome!!!!
1,DonnieD37,"You purchase a feature to make the gameplay more enjoyable, only for them to get rid of it and replace it with some coins. Them removing the speed feature makes the gameplay very boring. They just ripped off a bunch of people."
1,Nzyioki,After paying $20 for features they decided to remove the features and change them to something else that is not even remotely comparable.
5,6547 kdog,I love that doesn’t force you to watch bad adds is so fun
1,GangstaPacMan,The grind for any progress is long and tedious and that’s saying a lot for a RuneScape player. It tries to hard for you to click an ad or buying things in the game. Sad part is it could be a lot of fun but greed definitely got in the way.
5,Dino3356,It's a great game and I recommend great game I've been playing for a month great 100%recomend
5,And the guy,This game is very good and not what I expected but the grinding is ok but how do you even beat them? But it’s really fun!
3,Ethanthephonenerd,"I personally started a little while ago, but when you buy a troop the opposing side spawns 5x as many. Making it very hard to beat."
5,What people think,It is fun and interesting and very interesting it’s also a great way to pass time
5,Arictorres62,It’s a very simple game but with the ability to keep improving.
4,Rose aka,it’s a really good game to play when you’re really bored and you have nothing else to do 4 stars
2,Moondogg51,"Boring game, way unbalanced,, I’m calling one warrior and they have 12 out lol like okay, grind and grind to level up food production by .01 lol really? All that to work up and have it all reset when you “age” up.. what’s the point? To grind some more? Next…"
4,TricksterSquad,Too many ads.
1,jayrad889,Was a very fun game initially with lots of strategy. The more you play the harder it becomes and it feels like it’s trying to force you to spend money to buy more cards and upgrades which I refuse to do.
1,Scottiie216,I’ve been playing this game for months and now you want to charge for the 1.5x which makes everything so much more difficult but also adds money in your pocket. Yeah no thanks I’ll just delete it.
1,Nuke603,Most recent update removed my in app purchase and converted it to in-game currency. Not what I spent my money on in the first place. Thanks for nothing.  “Hey we sold you a car but we don’t sell those now so here’s a skateboard instead”
3,RyGuy100001,"Newest update is breaking the game, specifically the daily rewards. No timeline on a fix yet. When working, the game can be enjoyable."
2,RicFlair2045,"The game is fun at all. I don’t mind grinding, but I think it’s stupid that every time you evolve, you have to restart upgrading your base Health and meet speed is how fast your meat generates which is used to put down units"
1,Fred3439,Progress is incredibly slow you have to lose repeatedly in order to earn enough coins to buy  upgrades to stand a chance. Wants you to watch ads to earn double coins etc just isn’t fun sadly.
1,bob_______,"Please don't have a large arrow pointing to something that I cannot buy for days. Also, despite all of the reviews saying how great this game is with ads, one of the Daily Quests is to watch 5 ads. No, I don't want to watch 5 ads."
3,Verrun05,"Game play and advancement is slow slow, but you get plenty of ads to ease that. It’s a time killer but you get bored fast."
5,NoStimyCheck4Me,I love the show progression time. And not ads in this game is literally a godsend.
1,Can't open the game 咝,If they just let you play the game instead of wasting everyone’s time it’d still be trash because this has no soul.  Go play Age of War and other old flash games.
5,Masen97,Fun to play after you get past the first couple ages
1,PythonZzz32,Race event doesn’t fairly match me so I can’t win the race. On the first night there’s somebody on timeline 10 already and I could barely make it past 5! Happened to me twice! I like it and grind so much but I just can’t win the race !
5,Alexander12345435,Try this game is so fun it a good game in the first I didn’t like it but know I love this game is so fun to play
3,Batboy9510,We need to have the way to use to upgrade the health and damage of the units with coins and no I not saying about the card Ps fixed the cards
3,HiMudaFagssss,Why do I get same rewards as  the 30 seconds ad when watching 50 seconds ad? Triple the reward(s) if that’s the case.
5,sksjhddk,This game is so addicting. It’s really fun and super unique 10/10 would recommend
5,Jwiz7,"I like it cause the adds aren’t mandatory, and it’s easy playing :)"
4,ender0717,"This game is so addicting! I end up playing for hours grinding, and lose track of time."
2,Slim_212,"It’s a fun game but, it looked like it was made in a rush. Everything was off centered or not in the right place. The annoying part is that you basically loose every time if you’ve just started."
5,aydin ha,Finally a mobile game that isn’t filled with ads I love playing this game
4,shatteredontt,Battle 6 is so hard I almost beat it with the daily meat ads but if I want to beat it I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER DAY please make it easier.
5,Lishadale,It is exactly what add shows it to be good game if you’ve got some time to waist
3,Star Wars on top💯,"The game is very fun and addictive, but to progress in the game u have to watch adds or u have to play for 1 hour for 2 upgrades that do barely anything."
5,sheepy lover cuty,"It’s very fun, it’s just a concern that it’s a bit hard to get your meat eating up."
5,lukekk5,"Kinda difficult in the beginning, but otherwise it’s very fun!"
3,GOODd BUT BADd,The game is great and all but the progression rate is very slow I have played for and hour now and the food production rate is on at 0.70 and I’m getting angry. So please fix the food production rate.
4,Gh212ooo,"I love this game it really nice .art work simple and nice ,but I wish the is multiplayer with others to make it more competitive"
2,xRapidLegendz,"Forces you to watch ads sometimes and if you don’t then you don’t get your normal reward for doing a battle. Does it every other battle, it is not a bug"
3,fishnuts24,"For over a week now, keys don’t replenish, neither do daily challenges. Game is fun otherwise. Would give 4 or 5 stars if it wasn’t bugged right now."
2,^Serious_,Rune dungeons no longer refresh for me. They used to daily but it’s been more then a week and they no longer refresh. Sad really was fun while it lasted. Won’t be spending anymore money.
3,Nrollins3193,I don’t understand why these creators make ads that looks super fun and then the game itself is nothing like it..?
5,fluhfluh,More you play the better it gets!
3,Mr. K zzzzz,I won 4th place last night and still haven’t received my prize ??? What’s up how do you want to proceed
1,_hunterblair_,Literally all Ads. Not sure how it has 4.6 stars because it is trash. Can not progress without watching ads every 20 seconds. Literally spent more time watching ads than I did actually playing.
5,fjdhxh if sjgfjdyb ghdji,It is just how it looks on the adds 10 out of 10
5,Shagg49er,Fun and simple to learn! It's similar to Age of War but more polished. Though missing out on turrets and such.  Download and enjoy!
5,EZGEE2135,If you think I’m a boy I’m not this game is very addictive and fun I will play this game everyday it’s so fun watching and hurting the others good game
4,wizardman 42,"Genuinely amazing, what would seem even more amazing would be if there was something like a sandbox mode or whatever."
5,Hamburger335788865333,This is one of the only mobile games that I could play forever
4,Hello880889,Great but I just can’t get past battle 6 no matter how wat because they spawn too fast and can’t keep up
2,Nazhardt,Devs definitely didn’t think of ppl who don’t evolve before defeating the enemy. I did and the enemy evolved 1 tapping my men getting barely any coin for my evolve. No reset option too… been upgrading my production and kinda saw this coming
4,z5382545ssfwhrd,50 clicks to get past other adds to play this fun game. So delete and out
1,JamesJanuary,I just started playing and the enemy’s have all the characters and their base has 500 health and you have to wait 10 seconds just to get 5 that get destroyed by the overpowered archer cavemen guys overall it’s hard to play don’t recommend
5,nknails,Graphics? Great! Gameplay! Great! Challenging? Absolutely  Fun? I can’t stop playing it!
5,Jojo_is_him_yeah,I’ve been playing for 2 hours and I’m still not bored😎😎
1,Bartmaan,"Many users paid for 1.5x (and more paid additionally for 2x speed), which was already a bad sign. Then the developers REMOVED the speed increases from the game completely. I paid for something that no longer exists. Lame"
5,Ioiiosidjdm,Ok so I really have almost like nothing to say about this game cuz it is SO FUN so I will save you readers some time! Love ur game!
4,Luxareu,The game is great I just got done with caveman people it took about 1 hour and I know that the game will just get better.
2,Xtinct91,It’s painstakingly slow and driven by ads. Really the only  way to progress is watching the ads. Even then the upgraded are costly for very little in exchange. Good concept poor execution.
5,kemimoto🏎️🏎️,To where as the main review wasnt true in my opinion.  alli have to say is that its a great game and get better kid!
5,School-app-reviewer,"This is a game for like any age, and shows the weapons, and uniforms from back then, to the future!"
3,CamBam12274,Fun and addictive game but probably the slowest start to any video game I’ve ever played. It took 13 min just to finally hit the enemy building. Over all fun just really slow.
1,EagleEye433,"The gameplay is simple, but entertaining. However, the progress is super slow. I get that you want to make money with the games but why not implement different strategies rather than just needing to spam ads? It’s a shame."
5,The one664866,It’s a little hard but as you get more upgrades it’s easies
4,Zombimorg,So the game is not a five star because of how slow the start is but it gets fun throughout all the stuff
5,Guy:):):),This game is extremely addictive
5,"meoenmd,dorkr","Practically no ads, (unless you choose to watch an ad)"
4,z enchanting y fish's,It’s a pretty solid game and it is pretty fun to play. Would definitely recommend for a fun road trip game.
1,ChiefKief23,Downloaded and played for a few hours total. Almost no “skill” value at all. Basically just waiting for the opportunity to significantly boost abilities by watching ads which then trivialize the whole game. Recommend passing on this one.
2,alexSsss67739,"game was fun before you realize you have to replay the same level 20+ times just to get to the next spot, where you do the same thing"
3,the guy who hates imetric,This is a game that you play for 10 minutes and never open again
2,MaxDWolf,"Game and advancement are far too slow to keep this game interesting, particularly at the start. The number of ads you have to watch to make any progress is ridiculous."
5,svguglygod,The best game to play with no ads u less u want to get that help games amazing
5,yichhffhc,Its just like the ads! (The only one that looks like the ads)
5,Ver cewl,"Glad it’s offline, and not that many ads."
3,eandoetweaker,It would be 5 stars but I low key wish we could use are cards during the event after reaching timeline 4
5,Hello’shd,I gave this 5 stars because l just really like simple games and this is a really simple but good game.
1,Murf101,Progression is WAAAAAYYYY TO SLOW and you literally have to watch ads every 30 seconds if you even want to experience two levels of what this game has to offer
5,wOmptrAt,This game doesnt not shove ads in your face all the time really fun enjoyable 10/10 game
5,Jrok82,"For as simple as this game is, I enjoy it quite a bit!"
5,Person reviewing this game yo,I like that it is simple and it’s cool that the enemy is stronger than you at the start good game :D
5,Zac19951816,I love these style games. Ads are annoying but still fun
1,Ejp..,I don’t mind a 30 second ad every now and then for a free game especially if it’s good but the ads on this one are getting longer and longer. It’s up to two minutes of unskippable ads.
2,JeffSchwarz,Just an ad watching simulator  I could see it being really fun if they didn’t make it painful slow to play unless you watch ads.
5,Swahiliing american,I curled my toes while playing this game
1,Micah Riley,"This is an ad based game. 30 seconds of gameplay, 30 seconds of adds. Absolutely trash. Your upgrades do not transfer to the next time period causing you to spend more time on adds. This trash should be illegal."
5,JIZZUMZ,"Game is the same as shown in ads.  Decent, fun, interesting, simple,"
4,2am cheese,"This is great but you can’t get rid of ads by paying. Please give us this ability, devs"
5,Fordtrckman,Onily the game is so good because the adds get you so overpowered so you can beat the game in farm age
5,muffinhdhshhdhd,Like a game I played before but better and smarter
1,Kiwi928,I know mobile games need ads to make money so that’s not the problem. The problem is that when an ad appears and I have to close the game and reopen it and restart and lose progress that’s a problem.
1,connor goodlin,It is physically impossible to beat the computer on even the first levels without watching adds while it doesn’t force you to watch them you will not win without them
2,Wingman242448427,It was fun for a few days but it got terribly monotonous after a few timelines. The gameplay loop is just so repetitive without enough new content to keep it interesting as you progress further
2,Zertiof,Designed to make you watch as many ads as possible to progress as fast as possible
5,Smurphy8997,Really fun and addictive. I do wish there was a way to purchase no ads but it’s a great game.
2,cgmn23,The game itself is very entertaining and you don’t have to play or watch ads. However it is nothing like the game that I tried to download
5,ya boy anth,This game is actually really good let’s you chose adds to watch and is fun
5,Thank u I luv this app,My dad started playing this game and I downloaded it and I’m obsessed love it keep it up❤️😊😍🤩
1,Jack9274826,I always start in the game with like 50 hp and the bot has over 10K and they have all three of the attackers and I have 1 how am I supposed to beat that I quit this game and I will delete it fix ur game if you want more people play this!
2,Patty-vice,Once you get past timeline 5 it’s pretty much impossible to beat the levels in this lifetime without watching ads. It’s fun at the start though.
1,Bobtbuilder_13,I played the game for awhile now and when it updated it completely bricked me out even spending all the free points on card didn’t get me close to being able to play the game
3,screw cnnn,Thanks for making this game. I’ve downloaded it twice. I appreciate you guys not making me watch ads
5,Jaxi122,The game was fun so where the ads I had a lot of fun playing this
5,Wassuphuh9,I never right positive reports but this time I did just make new units cheaper
5,bobby 123456771,Fun. No ads after every attempt is nice
5,TinySharkFin,Good for long car rides I suggest not too many ads I suggest you get it 👍👍
1,Juju beer,The speed at which to gain food is absurd. Even doubling up through ads you’d have to play a 20 second game over and over for hours to make any progress
4,Iamsocoolbecauseithinkiam,"The ads have X on them, but when I tap them, it won’t exit"
2,HoratioWiddlesworth,Game is fun but a number of the ads never develop an option to close them forcing a game restart without rewards.
5,Nath the cool guy real,I like the game and it fun and no Internet to play it a and game and it cool game it fun it can get repetitive some times but it a good .
5,gipkkkkkk,It’s fun and entertaining and it’s cool to see the ages of the earth and the units bring it to another level
3,PirateLife95,"It’s a little hard getting up in the levels, but it’s worth it when you get the high power guys."
2,coppereye,Upgrades are tiny and incremental and take multiple (slow) runs to obtain. Save your time and do something else.
5,Teveyan,Jk but its still good
4,Ahhhhhhhhhggeag,You have to grind for a little bit but once you get the hang of it it’s really fun
5,Elixir wolf,I hope this game gets lot of updates !!
3,Aknies,The game itself is good but if you got more coins per fight to evolve it would be five stars in my opinion
3,zachary agnew,The game is pretty unfair with how little you start with and how much time you have to put in its way to much money to just get 1 meat a second
5,kxdlvsffjnnlv,Best game ever there is still a couple other levels that I can’t beat
2,Jca-13,"You’ll either waste time grinding or waste time watching ads. There isn’t a “no ads” one-time payment you can make. If it weren’t for the constant incremental grind, this game would be way more fun."
1,Swartzy1118,"This game is the worst pay to win I have ever seen. Play this one level in which you lose 10,000 times so you can upgrade your food production by 0.02. Was excited for this and extremely let down."
5,Alec's nards,When your this is the write game to play
2,Never ever ever555,Well it is easy to understand but it is so hard to beat even the first I spent over an hour trying to beat the first level
1,lilslaus,The game requires too much grinding and watching adds. The enemies base has too much health and requires to much time to destroy. Last but not least the video was absolutely click bait do not download this game for your own sake
4,clifard,It took 15 years to beat the first level
3,Ava ❤️💕🍩,I was playing a few days ago i had a hero i had 3 of the dungeons and i had skills. I just got on and now I have cards and no hero and one dungeon.
1,RaizNHell,Developer just removed a “game speed” feature that made the game enjoyable. Now it is super slow and monotonous. Wouldn’t recommend until they bring it back.
4,Sus worm,I wish we could go back to Lowell things like the farm or age back to the Stone Age
1,Idekbutthisgamecheecs,Every time I watch a ad it doesnt let me click anything and I have to restart the game and get absolutely no reward it’s not just my phone also tried on a friends same problem
5,Odie2008,This game is so cool! It’s very fun and very easy to play. I love grinding coins and watching the little people fight!
4,Thanks184,"I love the game, but I hate the fact that I can’t go back civilizations"
3,Angelo____________OG,The game just takes waaaaay to long to progress and they really try to get you to watch ads to gain power
1,football18687,"As a few have already stated, AI always have the upper hand and progression is at a snails pace. Devs clearly don’t care about the reviews but hopefully a few will see this and avoid as at least half these reviews are fake."
1,apshaeffer,"PLAGUED WITH ADS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROGRESS WITHOUT THEM.  R.I.P. Flash games, downloaded this because it's Age of War.   The offline progression in this game is maddening, requiring you to sink hours getting through each ""timeline"" unless you prefer to do it in 30 minutes with 30 minutes of ads. You'll be two days deep before you find out theres other features than just the single player ""story"".   If you're going to steal the idea at least make it enjoyable for the audience."
1,wVeinz,"First of all, it doesn’t make sense why the enemy has 500health and u have “2”. It doesn’t make sense why the enemy can stack up units and spawn like 30m at time while u have like non. You guys NEED to make the progression faster, and I mean WAYYY faster. BUT for now, it’s a one star."
4,San Francisco forty niners,I love timeline 2 and 1 they have a bunch of skins (+1) a little laggy though (-1) put everything else is amazing (+4)
5,how I like Numberblocks,This is great for long trips thank you for making SUCH a good game!
4,Zaiden16,This game is so fun but the enemies are on another level They send 5 Dino on 1st battle but since I saved for farm age I took them out
1,Hazelnut4life.,You can’t even beat the FIRST LEVEL with watching adds. This game is only possible if you watch adds. It take hours just to get to the second level without watching adds. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. the owners only want money.
5,Carter_5007,I love it its hart to get used to but if you give it a chance it is a great and fun game to play
5,Shoktroops,"This game is so much fun. The advertisement I saw, is exactly what the gameplay is. I love it."
1,alrppi,"The ads often don’t give you an option to close them at the end, forcing you to quit game and lose progress. Insane amount of ads if you wish to advance."
1,KCCWORKS,"The game is fine, about every other ad is broken, and won’t close, requiring you to exit the game and lose your reward and sometimes a little bit of progress."
5,My review part two,I love the animation they look so cute. My favorite is the dinosaurs and overall just a really fun game
5,Beccareb,It’s really fun and it’s not that complicated or fast paced. The ads for food are also quite useful.
3,jcohen623,"The game is really fun, but takes way to long to upgrade units, when the other team has unlimited units and health"
1,kronlk,You progress way to slow gotta play the same stuff over and over and watch ads everytime I’ve played at least 30 games and still haven’t moved off the first stage
5,g&ytryjyutytytfyjtfyjtfyjfy,"I started this game and it is really fun and good, I has ads but only for rewards so it’s good."
3,Yourmomma79,Definitely a decent game but you can’t play it without watching an ad every round
3,Bebdbdje,I haven’t even been able to play the game since it crashes every time I open it. I have an iPhone 14.
3,molotov453,Kinda feels like they want you to only watch ads to try and progress at all
1,A peer reviewed,I have been playing for 4 days and I can’t pass level one this game is too difficult lower the difficulty and I can’t even get 100 dmg to the first level with all the characters
3,will198219821982,There is an add  called solitary cash that plays nonstop and you can’t get your reward. The add just repeats itself everytime I try to close it
1,Cjmdclaw,"I’m not sure what happened, but after the update, the game is super slow and not enjoyable. I’ve spent money on the game and now it doesn’t even play well. Why did y'all slow the game down? It’s horrible."
1,Cheec1360,I have been playing for over two months. Out of nowhere I’m basically locked out of all the dungeons. I haven’t gotten any keys as I used to daily and I have not seen any events in over a week.
1,Chodemus Maximus,The basis of the game is just to replay each map over and over again until you’ve sunk enough time into it to win. No strategy required
5,Heavymetalman22,Not much is required for this one. Easy
3,Ok 🐨,Takes forever for someone to come out of the cave I start with two and the other team has five hundred
5,vaderaustie,Sent from my iPhone
5,SGH2.0,It’s really good once u get a hang of it. Would recommend to anyone
3,Gmoneycashrecstudios,Good game but you have to get through a 30 second Ad basically every 2-3 minutes to advance at a decent pace.
1,gheinle,"This game is a clear cash grab, with terrible graphics, they literally re use the same sprites for multiple levels. this game is just an ad farm and you should not waste time on this trash. The developers should feel ashamed for producing such garbage."
1,Ben Barkin,Game is already based on watching ADs and putting money into it. I spent $30+ on the event and after winning I did not get my badge reward and all my money went to waste. I contacted support and they basically told me to go kick rocks. I have all the emails as proof.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME
5,HajjiNewar,"I don’t leave reviews because it’s such a nuisance, but this game got me hooked lol. It’s so simple, yet so fun."
3,Pharah Mari,Leveling up is boring since you have to repeat the same thing over and over again. It's not fair.
3,dajdiemdvafwudixmxva,This game could be a lot of fun but it has been perfectly balanced to make it a total grind unless you buy their tokens
3,game is pretty good1,"This game is fun however it requires too much grinding, it would also be fun if sandbox mode is added when you beat farmer age"
4,Dusty eye,No forced ads without purchasing it but game gets very grindy very fast and is not for people looking for instant gratification
1,Johnny-P1823,"The game is unbalanced, boring, and requires you to watch countless ads unless you’re fine with just not having fun with the game. It’s terrible and I’m convinced all the 5 star reviews were either paid for or bots."
2,Junior8311,The progression is SO slow and is annoying facing wave 1 for 5 days just to not beat it. So unless you can use all the time in the world don’t get it it’s a waste of storage
4,Battle and merge,It is challenging but some how the ads are getting too much but this is still a good game
1,durrrrrrer,While you don’t need to watch adds and have the option of them is nice it took me almost a hour to get past the first wave and THEN IT JUST GETS EVEN HARDER skill tree will take ages to get your troops up to standard as well
5,Leoklin,I just started to play would add more worlds
5,Easley jr,This game is sooooo good it teaches u how to think smart and fast
5,Rickety Bill,Been having a blast playing!
5,cigcig ur,It’s absolutely amazing as long as you ignore the ads
4,Vrgod9000,The game is overall good it just requires a lot of grinding and there are adds everywhere.
2,Wtvcgu,"I want to go back in time, but I can’t figure out how to do it because I want to go back into where they had the military tanks"
1,Ben08012,"After you have seen all ages there’s nothing new just grind and grind and every timeline is repetitive with multiplier difficulty like x3 x4 so on and so forth. Ad grabbing boring game, trust me there are so many games out there but this is a total waste of time."
4,amc1140,Super repetitive but somehow so addicting. I had to quit at Timeline 9 because the difficulty multiplier was too extreme.
1,Gangstaman101,You will spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Normal game progression is so unbearably slow you have to watch ads to get anywhere. The point of the game is just to watch ads. That’s it. That’s the game.
5,helalileye,This game is so simple but so fun has so much potential for success and is really addictive 👌🏻
3,charlezhangisme,"Finally finished battle 1 only to find similar battles and compared with the enemy, you come back to the beginning"
5,Maximilian16479,It is always so fun and keeps me occupied on long road trips.
1,TWREXS 🦖🦖🦖🦖,Bro literally this thing takes up more storage then genshin impact like dang it wouldn’t even download Pluss this is just a crappy version of the battle cats Pluss the battle cats doesn’t force you to watch ads every 2 seconds
2,SCIWITHJAYS,Instantly when you join the AI just has 500 cave health with you only having 1 this game is burning hot garbage because you either have the longest grind spree or you pay 2 win DONT GET THIS GAME
1,LittleBoyBlu14,Do you love watching ads more than riveting gameplay? Do you love losing over and over again? Do you love wasting your time so a cheap app developer can make a quick cent off of you? Well then this is the game for you!
4,Silver101z,Fun game but please add a no ad option for like 5$ or something. Would be so much more enjoyable
4,henry 7 years old,Make the levels easier. They are super hard.
5,zenomerc👀,You will need patience for this game
2,ffvhgggnncf,You spawn in where you can’t really even beat the first battle and need to make it more equal your base started at 2 health and the other one 500 health
2,Alphaman368,Way too many ads. You can only “enjoy” this game by watching 30 ads each time you play.
1,SirJimboJangles ,"Fun so far, but the incessant “are you enjoying the game?” prompts for a review are SO annoying. Please give the option to stop asking, or use the iOS built-in feature (which can be user disabled)."
3,Trudon the don,And I bought the battle reset thing & it still starts me over when I evolve
3,\.=./,Let me pay you $10 for permanent ad skip. Fun but ads on ads on ads on ads.
5,OG King11,This is the best game I ever played in the world and it has been my absolute favorite game ever a
3,Stupidnicknameheree,No forced apps Only good really After reaching world 4 you run into the paywalls or grind for days on end.  Food rate at 3 a second and still counts as 1… wth
5,turtleTAC_2,This game is so fun and addicting and has almost no ads
1,Joe8998,The overall concept of the game okay however it places you in a position where it wants you to watch ads or make purchases.
3,Anonymous507.,It’s hard in the beginning but after a minute you’ll be good
4,small learner,Great game overall but we need a we game purchase for no adds
1,The Most Dishonest Critic,"dev will try everything they can to waste your time  as much as possible in the beginning with the ridiculous amount's of enemies for the first stage, it will probably take you 50 tries to get to stage 2 imo."
5,Tickle my pick,I love the game but I don’t like how it resets my food when I age up👨‍🦳
1,Aaaadfghhddfjjhfds,Yet another interesting game ruined by an overabundance of ads. Ads while you play. Ads between rounds. Ads before rounds. Add that will crash or freeze the game that will not be tracked when you relaunch. I hate this world. I tire of the ads.
2,AX8VR,"Age of war ripoff, but no abilities, no turrets, and has ads and cards. Also the ai cheats, and spawns the same thing each time. Progess can be sped up with ads, but then “literally” there are more ads then gameplay."
5,ækjhv,Good game level ups slow but overall it is a good game
4,99jack997,They claim there are no adds but there is and the first level of the game is so hard
4,popstar game,It’s nice game good roll play but VERY repetitive and you have to watch many adds to advance but good game 😀
5,Drip99o,It has so many different ages and it’s so much fun
5,the black panda yay,Ok I just needed to get .7 food collection speed and 17 health
1,Darnad,The game itself is fun however the multiplier videos do not work. I spend several minutes on the videos only to go back and not be awarded the multiplier I watched the ads for. Fix this please.
1,Chraestopher,"As stated, upgrades aren’t worth it, progression is super slow, daily challenges request you to watch up to 5 ads in a row. I’d rather spend $1-$2 to disable ads forever and actually play this game."
3,beef hammock,I have to watch an ad in order to unlock the 1.5x speed button….every game…seriously?
1,Jordan gomez1637,When I try to join and press “battle” it literally kicks me out to the homepage. I’ve been trying to play for the past hour but it keeps kicking me out !! Does anyone know how to help me or am I doing something wrong ?!
1,Nickname12345.,I just updated the game and now it crashes after 3 seconds of opening it i tryed to close the app same thing restarted my phone same thing this happend as soon as i did the last update
3,zackkclifton,Great game reminds me of age of war on the computer but this game need to be faster troop wise troops move way to slow so it makes early game drag out
5,SupermanXD,Best game ever because I’m really into history and I’ve learned a lot
2,CynNotSin,"Love this game but once I finally got to timeline three, the app keeps crashing after loading event results. Please fix this."
1,iceberg1347,I uninstalled a while back game was fun but I had done everything you could do tried to sign back in boom account gone and it also is not restoring my purchases 0-10
2,Pbgamer96,"The game is so slow now and 10,000 gems was not enough, the game runs so slow at 1x speed please make 2X speed the normal or at least 1.5x speed"
5,Nickflame68,Their base has 500 health and the ai is hard to beat
5,Looseinfur,Best game omg so good so skibidi so sigma good when boring good in class good for anywhere I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it thank you for this amazing game it’s sooooo goooodTHANK YOUUUUUUUUU!
5,Ezra Box,It was very fun until the vinegar taste started lingering in the back of my mouth.
1,Do.An.Ev.,"Without watching tons of ads in this game, you won't get far. I won't give it more than one star in the rating"
5,ghostbustr@icloud,Too many ads but still good
5,Lovetooread,Some reason it is not letting me login but by the videos I can tell it’s a very good game
5,🖐✋🖖👉🦷,It’s a fun game. The graphics might be a little low but I don’t really care. The game is TOP NOTCH!!!
4,Jokingpyro8147,Need some balance to health increase it needs to give more per upgrade but good game besides that
5,The real small boi,I just like and please keep making games like this or sequels
1,Niles54,"The frequency of “watch ad to get X” is way too high. The rewards for watching are way too high to not watch. Apart from that, no option to pay to remove ads is also a downside for me."
5,eA gAMES8263529,"It’s a simple game, a bit grindy but still fun to play"
4,Honk18.5,Consistent in style and progression also needs to think about strats a little
1,JohnE217,"Harry Potter ad turns the screen completely black at the end and all I can do is close it, losing my points and not getting double from the ad either."
5,MuuYuu95,"Fun, easy to learn, and engaging progression system. Ads are optional and never feel forced."
1,Pidgui,This title should say it all but it’s very slow in an attempt to make you watch as many adds as they can. I wanted to see how it played cause it looked like a half decent game but I’d skip it.
5,Gtafan199999999999,This game is amazing 10/10 this game dose force you to watch ads
5,did you go to yours,"No words. Just, wow."
4,Online review..,Games fun and all but it would be even more popular/ competitive if there was online pvp
5,N. Herits,"Very fun game, it’s a little slow but it is still very enjoyable"
2,Missaeliwus,"Game is to hard to get money and upgrade, at somepoint it get upset you playing this game and not getting better at all is to slow"
3,Yarakameme,Please put on merchant remove ads option
3,willk657,The game is just too slow considering how little money can be earned on top of the ads offered for advancement
5,yougandan,You get what you pay for.
1,Thors device,"Yes, you can play with out adds but to get anywhere in the game you need to watch adds. After battle three I was done with it. 60 adds just to come close to beating battle three"
4,Mezemo,"Adds aren’t too bad or too long, but they’re there. . It’s super fun and great to pass the time."
5,Neven Paul,Always need ads to win. fun but ad to win
1,Ultraman82,"You’re watching ads right out the gates.  Can’t even get through the 1st stage successfully unless you’ve played it a long while, or decide to watch ads.   Not a fun way to kill time."
4,grunge frog,Its pretty fun but progression is pretty slow in the beginning
2,omg_its_obama-,You should have the “watch ad task” as the last task instead of the first task every time. I’ll put 5 stars if you change that
4,p0tterish,"Enjoy the game, but cannot purchase coin/special packs."
2,mavthedev.js,I just ended up quitting after beating it because I couldn’t even beat it without watching an ad to gain more food
5,🥠✅ROBLOX,It’s not the best but it’s good for me because it’s really easy and fun
1,The Great Gupta,It is an impossibly slow start necessitating using 30 second ads to get a tiny amount of money to slowly update your stats. A huge waste of time and money grab on an already copy and paste game.
5,Ryder Nixon,Best game ever I am addicted to and will never stop till I get all max
5,dbdysuejebshak,Good to play when bored or need something to do
5,hdbdjkdbdhskkdkf,"I love games like this, and this is a perfect game. It is fun, with very, very few adds. A must play!"
2,Robloxbeastero,All the cards are either HP boosts or damage boosts and you could’ve made the CEO card give meat production but you didn’t. The gameplay is the same with nothing new.
1,fuller.brian,"Way too much grinding. Just not worth it, yes, you can watch an obnoxious 30 second add, but must even repeat that over and over again. Great concept, fun little game, but way too much grinding to be any fun."
1,joey123joey,You lose round one. Then lose again. Watch a bunch of ads and you might make it to round 3. Still losing. Just a “game” to make you watch a million ads.
1,Bubba Brans,I just updated it and the app wont work. Every time I close out of the leaderboards menu the app crashes. Can’t even play the game this ridiculously annoying
1,Cookiemonster193748482,"Very repetitive, the opening battle takes at least 20 plays to beat. Recommend you pass on this game and find something else"
2,a_parody,I liked this game until I realized that I wasn't actually getting the rewards for about half the ads I watched.
5,chase jack eli,Absolutely awesome this game is challenging yet way more fun than it is challenging. 5 stars 👍
2,SelSmith84,The game was fun until watching the ads kept freezing and you repeated your actions over and over. I will be more than likely deleting this game.
5,Friendly Neighborhood hoinkle,"It’s an artistic masterpiece, I sold all 5 of my big toes for this and it was worth it"
1,Hskcyrnsidnsjdmdudbal,"I’m dumbfounded as to why this has 4.5/5. All you do is continue to lose the same level over and over, buying an upgrade that increases food production by a tenth of a percent. The fact this is regarded as a good game is evidence of the brainrot in todays youth / society."
1,pintohguinness,"Good luck advancing!  It cost so much to advance your warriors and your home base!  You don’t earn enough coin every round to advance anything!  Gave it a shot for a week, and am so frustrated!  Good thought process on a game…poor execution!"
4,Shizuakiul,Awesome game!
1,tanner.rieck,The game becomes very boring soon after timeline 15. The game is a GRIND. There are much better games to put forth time and energy that don’t require watching ads every couple of minutes.
1,jcpmics,"Watching ads is the only way to progress. Other than that you will be forced to mindlessly tap the same buttons for hours with no sense of excitement or fun. Genuinely horrible experience, just a slow boring grind for nothing"
2,Free money!!!,"This game is just designed to get you to click as many ads as possible. Game play is intentionally Grindy, which is fine but it not rewarding. GGs next"
5,Timothy7942098,this game was so good. It was so fun and I haven’t even got through the Roman Empire civilization yet.
3,Lime1324,I had to play 1 level 14 times and had to watch adds to bet that level. It was the first level in the game!
5,owwwwwen,Best game I have ever got I recommend playing long periods of times
3,Jkuffs,I’m at level 39 and have yet to see any board like the one displayed in advertising
5,trrggfdtyhhgghhj,No adds to bee seen outside of doubling rewards. Good fun if you have free time!
1,Squishsdad,I purchased the speed up upgrade.  Then they took away the upgrade have me a few gems and 2 or3 days later offered for me to buy the upgrade I want my upgrade
2,to many bugssssss......,"This game is fun but whenever I try to watch a add for 2x coins 75% of the time the add freeze and I have to close out the app, and I get no coins, not even the 1x coins, Linda scammy."
4,Spot-review,This game is really I just don’t like that the meat takes so slow
5,Hamms hds,The game is indeed incredible.
1,SethRT96,"This game is so incredibly boring and slow I couldn’t make it more then 20 minutes. There’s not one single thing I could say good about it.   Any good review is a paid review, don’t believe them."
2,shdhhwgwveudjsb,I didn’t even know you can upgrade your base health until i saw a little tiny bar. Please make it so I can see the whole upgrade GUI.
5,I love this game🤘,Great game very slow so it keeps you  busy
5,isuckonkids,I like this game so much because of the characters and game
1,use a for the,The game is great and all but it’s too unbalanced at the start you are given 2 hp while the enemy has 500 making the game not fair so you have to grind and grind and ads are like most of the game and the enemy can spawn 20+ soldiers which makes the game grindy
3,ahdnanadj,Watching ads speeds up progress but gets really time consuming
5,Orfydxggxvhfch,The way to go if you are board
4,Nickelsmart69,Great game just please make a way to save the game to the iCloud or Game Center please
2,Watch Ads or die (& still die),It’s either you watch the Ads or you spend real money. Started out real fun & interesting BUT You will not progress far just by grinding. Oh & you need money to get good perks for your warriors.
5,Jazwhendo,"It’s a pretty cool game, doesn’t require internet. And ads are optional"
5,arobin99,"I suggest though that you add more stuff like siege units and not make evolving that repetitive, I mean sure units get more range and speed and you can compare it to previous eras but pls add stuff like catapults (does more damage to base) and battering rams (melee units in it can do catapult multiplier) you added spearmen (anti calvary), now make it have a multiplier for calvary! Overall it’s a really good game for killing time and can be treated as a simple war tycoon game with cute graphics and no inappropriate stuff like zombie survival. Edit pls read!!!!: you don’t actually need to watch ads to progress. You can just do it for the big hauls for 2x and 1.5 speed for even more grinding. Stop saying you need to watch ads to progress noobs and besides it’s not forced so shut up to kill time. Also it’s not a reskinned restart, get to renasanse era and also the “wave” pattern are different so the haters gonna hate, don’t listen because the devs don’t get a lot of revenue as a cost for making the game experience better with no forced ads and gems purchases, which are far from nessasary. To progress fast, upgrade the food production first to a decent amount until it get expensive, then do the same thing with the base health. Then stop upgrading and spend the money for evolving. Done. No ads needed. Whoever said that timelines are a reskinned restart, shut up and play a little more and see what I mean. Also the card boosters DOES do something, especially for unit health because you can barely win a 1v1 shooting. Also I have 40% more unit damage and trust me, it does do something all right."
1,half=breed,"Watching ads after every under a minute long battle to double your rewards which is necessary to advance? Yeah, don’t bother with this game. No idea how it’s well rated."
5,Idk121912,It’s pretty fun no ads I recommend if your bored 5 stars
4,Sir Bobbins McSped,"It super fun and addicting but it’s to easy, other than that, super fun"
5,Adamemaley,Ads are annoying but fun little game
2,Friendly_neighborhood_gamer_,This game can b good but lemme tell u something… ive been playing for over 2 hours and watched every add. After all that i cant even do 150 dmg to the cave. For that reason im out. Game is a waste of time.
5,184638383883,This is actually like the adds a simple but fun game 🤩
1,jacoblind,Played for 10 rounds. And it was enough for me to see this was a cash grab and ad revenue game. There was no change in speed and it was a massive time waste and not in a enjoyable time waste game. A I want to waste time writing a bad review game.
5,XenoEternalSage,I only got the 599 pack. Solid game worth it for creators
4,SpeedyVette,Missions aren’t available so I can’t earn any gems
4,BBBBbBbBnBbBbBb,There’s too many adds but it is good if you ignore the adds
4,Could have improvements,This is a pretty good game that is kinda like a base defense game with many upgrades and units but it has lots of better add offerings
4,My great revie,Fun game I do really recommend if you have free time or are bored
2,Crossey roadd,The first level is so hard to beat please make it easier also the amount and length of the ads is way to much but it’s fun I guess
1,Temu is a waste,Most boring game ever it showed in the ad a game where you use strategy no. It’s a game where you wait a whole 2 minutes for 1 easy round it’s the most slowest progress and little no effort game I’ve seen ever
3,galaxy war-ice empire,They need to at least have a limit on ads per day like 5 ads per day
5,Nafisagllitter,Best game to play on long car rides or if no Wi-Fi 5/5
4,hdbsveshvdhdbdv,"The game is fun but the progression takes very long, upgrades cost a lot of money"
5,Chrjs24,Fun game but can we get rid of ads ?
3,Dotgodkvf,"I love fighting and this game actually makes people learn to fight, and I already got through the first stage. me and my brother already got to the farm age. I love this game so much."
1,2Diablo1,Who creates a game that makes you die like 10 tomes before even been able to actually enjoy it.  I only played it less than 3 minutes cuz it was the stupidest game I’ve ever played!
2,A average man,"I’ve played this game for a while and  it does seem fun but, you get a lot of food just from watching ads."
4,Druw44,"The game is amazing, but can you perhaps lower the opponent’s hp?"
3,Ohyeah0420,Great game it’s super easy and fun to play but like at the very least the troops tht use ranged attacks should be able to hit the enemies attacking from inside the enemy base..
1,Meow meow meow town,"Boring, it takes like 15 rounds to make it 10 seconds in with out watching and that’s about the pace of this. Super boring and slow cash grab"
1,Can’t you guys fix the game,When I first started playing this game I was amazed at how your game was but then when I was at the army stage it just reset I don’t know how it reset but it just did after it reset I didn’t like this game anymore so please fix yo game
5,Bobo Jacoby,"This game is so fun and addicting, I can’t stop playing it!"
5,errfdzxcvv444 name taken,I didn’t know what to expect but it was a pleasant supper
3,dbidiskssm,"The skies too long to get the game going, upgrading is painfully slow"
1,jsbfngkeldfmf,"i liked the game a lot, but quickly uninstalled it because i realized you progress extremely slowly unless you watch all the ads."
5,Ollieboy6221,The game 🎮 only has ads for rewards I'm loving it
3,tam99875,"The game would be fun if it wasn’t so slow!!! I feel like ripping my hair out! And I am 53!!! 😳😳😳  This game is good, but put into ultra slow motion."
1,Danbuddy,Game is fun. Really enjoying it. Don’t even mind the ads. I hate that many many times watch an ad and the game freezes. No reward for watching. Don’t waste the time playing.
1,Callas93,The ads you force on people in other games are waaaay to long. I would casually play your game to kill time on the occasion but the ads you’ve forced me to sit through make me despise you. Terrible.
5,🫸🏻🫷🏿🫃🏽🫃🏽🫃🏽,"This game is hella fun, a little hard but still so much fun"
1,Milenko23,What happened! Keys don’t replenish and you can watch ads for 2 additional? And daily quests gone? Hopefully it’s a bug because if not that’s a bad update. Hurts new players greatly
1,murdock hammond,Bad copy of “Age of War” I’ve tried…. just go play the original   There are better real time strategy games out there… that don’t have abysmally slow progression with little entertainment value.
4,mls621,The only bad thing about this game is that your base starts with 2 health and their health starts with 500 health (still a really good game.)
1,Mr. Mozby,There are way too many offers to watch ads I’d pay for the option but I’ll just delete it instead
1,PoeticMelody,This game was made to make you watch ads. The gameplay is so slow that unless you watch every ad that pops up you won’t progress. This isn’t fun to play.
5,jcurfman422,This game is great!I think u should add a part of currency called “gold”!
2,wi guy,Incredibly slow without paying or Watching a never ending stream of ads. Pass on this one. Yuk
1,Quinnerino,"Watching ads is the only way to even keep up, progressing is so so hard and we need balance changes this minute, I’ll change to 5 stars if the game becomes more fair…"
5,Christian3525,Great time passer if you ever need something to do in spare time this is the game for that
4,Dram_iz_b0zz,This game is great for passing time but it does take some learning to pass through the timelines
1,Cartman1119,"Hundreds of coins for one upgrade, and you’ll be lucky if you make half of it from one round.  Unless of course you want watch some ads.  **** this ad farm."
5,Muktar3,Bring back memories from age of wars!!
5,jks0601,"This game, to my surprise, is a good way to pass the time."
5,Remington537,Just like the old Age of War and it’s very nice game to pass the time
5,I love my gf💕,Really simp and fun game especially with everything
3,Hellknight18250,Not over loaded with ads however difficulty gaining money to upgrade at first scaled heavily on the ai side of it
1,Gamer0728,Why is it so hard?! You have to keep replaying one level to earn just a little bit of coins and everything is so expensive to upgrade. Its not even fair
4,Nuh uh28492984,Game very fun. Amount of ad is completely fine. Content in ad bad for kid.
4,I can't get a nikename,I like the game it’s fun but there’s too many ads that’s all
3,MarvOnRecord,"progress is pretty slow even when you're constantly watching ads, and there isn't much skill/strategy to be had. seems like a well made game if the progression pace can be improved"
1,:) yayyy,This pushes you to watch ads in order to make any real progress.  The beginning of the game is so incredibly slow and upgrading does little to nothing.
1,WsLs_chivo,Got way too many ads and when you watch an add it doesn’t even give me the reward it just black screens and won’t do anything else.
4,artcjiittfjippnhftygvijhdetgfh,The game is very hard and you need to Mach time to finish
2,Zoon12,Starts out fun but it’s so hard to make real progress that it just becomes tedious. Deleting.
1,Bigzay1995,Horrible cuts off randomly in the middle of matches. Apps slow your phone. No customer support. Please save yourself 0/10
2,Screw this!!!!!,In order to upgrade overall you need cards and the daily tasks are supposed to give you card points as well as zombie rush.   The first day I had my daily tasks. It’s been a week. They never refreshed.   I have zombie rush as of 3 days ago- it never refreshed since.   Besides that- it’s a fun game. I just wish the tasks would refresh!
1,u j. fo. fks. fo,"The ads here are 30 seconds long and longer than the gameplay and when I downloaded this, I thought it was fun but I quitted at Stage 2 Timeline 1 cuz it was too boring"
1,Miller4481,This is a typical pay to win game or watch 100s of videos. I liked the game at first but 3 days later I am ready to delete it. I would love to give it 0 stars but that is not possible.
1,Matthew20000000000,Progression is super slow because you don’t get much money and the first battle is insanely hard unless you spend real life money to get in game money
5,Ken12457777,10 out of 10  perfect I’m crying right now
5,Pedro L..,Fun to play and remember he smart with the meat and work hard
3,hhehhc,The game is “decent” but the upgrades don’t seems to work so far be warned
4,poultrykitten,It is a fun game I enjoy playing but watching ads are sort of needed
1,rob21222,"The only game I have seen block progression unless you watch ads. Not just speed up progression, outright blocks it, as watching ads is a mandatory step along the starter path."
1,Ajs2123,They make it almost impossible to progress without watching ads and the actual progression is almost none existent. I don’t recommend it to anyone.
1,Pinkcricket06,So I saw the game ad and I installed the game and it wasn’t as fun in the ads and the bot in the first level is to hard to beat and every thing is about spending money you need to fix your game lessmore UG
2,OGPanda0718,Game isn’t too bad expect for the fact that it’s way too slow. Ads are the only way to really progress in this game .
5,buddy 4 eva,So there’s barely any adds and the game is just fun to play so yeah  BTW this was written by a kid
4,Janes Luther 14th XIV,This game is incredibly fun but its kinda a grindy game but i still play it alot. Would recommend
5,Eastelephant910,It’s very fun and you get to evolve and evolve over again u til the Morten age I think and stronger units
2,Tr@shg@me,Getting upgrades to production in the last level of the event is useless every time I do I seem to get less money from kills games rigged trash
1,CeceMoore36,I have an IPhone and I had no other apps running. About 2 seconds after I opened the app it would shut down and automatically close.
4,goofygiiber,This game is fun but it can take a long to progress further other than that it’s a fun bordom curing game
1,Bigwill7787,"If you enjoy watching ads, this is for you. You cannot progress unless you watch ads nonstop. And this game is a cheap rip off of Ages of War, which is 100x better than this trash!!"
5,This_game_is_assandbad,Games fun and no ads like all the stupid games
1,glabosoloco,I kept getting robbed of all my coins because the game would freeze and I’d have to close the app and start over. Pretty frustrating
1,Amadeus Meowzart,A game written that is to produce ad revenues for the developer. The only way to even have a chance is to watch ads. Played for a few minutes and never won a round. Deleted.
1,Isaac H. Ramirez,"Timeline 5 level 1 will take you about 100 matches before going on and its just so garbage not even fun, the game just becomes an ad simulator"
2,mch82727,"Don’t make purchases in this app, they’ll double charge you multiple times!!!"
1,wordification,"If you like watching ads and pretending you’re playing a strategy game while you grind for hours for no apparent reason, this is the game for you."
1,SoulNinjitsu,300 potions for one hero?!?! Can only have 9 heros total?!?! Can only have up to a 45% chance on completing a extreme mission?!?! Let’s not talk about how hard it is to get 300 potions without paying or grinding for months to just for the struggle.
1,cam69itslit,Did the developers even play their game?   Game soft locks you so hard at the 2nd timeline that you require a ton of resources to barely progress. I can’t believe there are 15 timelines behind this junk.
5,hashkdd,So many possibilities
5,S.S.Pee,Really fun and challenging game it took me a day to complete the first battle and I evolved
5,M3m€,It kind of reminds me of age of war but better
2,hovercast94,I can’t stand how my opponent gets multiple high leveled characters when I don’t have the meat to make them this game is so unfair!
3,trendiewraps,I thought it was a bad game like all other mobile games but this one is very good
2,Gtyyyy2749,"If you like ads, this is a great app. You get to see ads all day long. And in between the ads, you get to play a little!"
1,SutterCannaButtet,To even have a chance at playing or winning you have to spend almost as much time watching ads as you do play the game it seems fun but unplayable
1,Iron Juni0r,It seems good but every time I try to load into the game it crashes either when I’m loading or when I press the button saying battle
2,Treehouse43!,Just rinse and repeat. It’s the same thing over and over again.
1,I paid for the full app,If it takes more than 2 hours to start to get fun…. Talk about a grind. No way to progress without watching ads or paying real money
4,DiversityDan,"So far, I’ve had zero complaints. 4/5 stars."
2,Weathah,"If you enjoy 15 seconds of gameplay and 1-2 minutes of commercials, this game is for you."
1,itsmrgizmo,"After the update, removing the speed. Made the game crappy. And the constant glitch after watching ads. Don’t believe those 5 stars."
5,Cdcfthtcfcftbc,Me and my cousin love it it will be hard at first but it will become easy trust me 🙂
5,WilliamMartin03,Man scroll Instagram Man see We are warriors ad Man download game Man play Man happy

1,Mr. Toxin,"- 20% playing the game - 80% watch the advertisings / ads until you fall sleep and next day when you woke up, your cellphone battery already empty."
5,Coolkidxp4,One of the best games I have ever played
2,NicevilleLizard,"All this game is for is to watch ads,  I mean 30 second ads, I get it they need to make $$ but really it’s nothing but a scam when it’s this bad…"
3,i love youtube 2,They start out with 500 hp this game isn’t fair and one of the quest is watch 5 ads no one wants to do that money simulator for the devs
5,Beanbean_vr,"This game is out of this world, it is simple but very entertaining"
5,catclawunicarn,It is amazing I can never stop playing it is so fun
5,Ryan 1213,Wow. Blown away. Invigorating stuff. Farm age here I come!
1,ujsvdjdvdjdbns,I couldn’t even play the game every time I opened it it would just close when I did get to play it it was only for two seconds and it was very laggy
1,Nwhshejxhbdhdmsbsb,The game won’t work on my phone or iPad. I downloaded it and deleted it and then re download it and restarted my phone and it still didn’t work it kept on kicking me out.
5,BrittRL!,The best game it makes me happy when I'm mad and fun!
5,Tirirkdkfkfkfk,No forced ads 10/10
3,Among us playa,"So, uh… gameplay’s pretty nice, but your ads (I mean when I’m playing another game, the ads I get for you are unexitable)"
5,Riggs K.,"I find this game very fun and cool, this game makes me feel happy, good job developers"
5,Rows47,This game is really fun and exciting you will have a great time in this game
2,bduxjenejfjenejfhf,Spending hours or days to get good cards that can’t be used in the one place you want them to work in events just saying whoop whoop
5,gandjdnfjfmdmfmf,I’m too lazy just read the title…
5,Cutco Sales Rep,It is indeed addicting and I can’t get my hands off of it!  100% Love it
1,jaxasorous6,1 star because it just takes so much time. And a example is. It took me so many upgrades just to beat battle 1. And that made it take so long just to beat it
5,MSNBC's evening,Play it
1,Lee93RB,"It leveled up the enemy base before i evolved, causing the enemy to be too powerful for even my strongest guns regardless of tactic. Broke the game completely and there’s no way to go back."
2,CHANGE THIS GAME PLEASE,Every time you get a new generation of people not just your characters reset but your generating speed and up for your cave
5,Someone1234543,This game is great. It’s very fun. The first level was very hard but I beat it
5,Hindhigh,I literally curled my toes while playing this
5,Awesome dude.,Not many ads so that’s a fat W an it’s enjoyable to play.
5,isden7777,"Coming to this game, I was expecting something like age of wars or battle cats. While I was mostly correct, this game does something suprising—it allows unit clumping. While age of wars makes your units fight one at a time (excluding ranged units) and battle cats has cool downs for each unit you spawn, this game lets units gang up on eachother and has no cool downs. This means that saving your resources is more rewarding and strategies can be built around forming squads for maximum dps. WAW exemplifies this with ranged units and certain one use per battle abilities. The battles in this game are vicious and tense because of this. The typical tank character you get last in each age is your only safe guard against risking a total squad wipe most of the time. The progression can be grindy and the variety of units can be lacking, but the lack of forced ads is a nice touch and the game knows how to grab your attention with some new mechanic right when it stats to feel a little dull. Chances are, most of the people that say this game requires ad watching probably don’t understand this unit clumping mechanic and had beat their head against the Stone Age assuming they had no way to win except by getting enough food gen (a process sped up by watching ads). Under this logic I still don’t see why this matters since every other mobile game requires watching ads anyways.   Final note: world war age was a beautiful showcase of unit variety and more of that would be very appreciated. That is all."
1,Drum an,"Way too many ads, requires you to watch ads to get rewards, and you can’t progress a single age in a day if you don’t watch ads to progress"
2,xfsrsf,"The game is a fun little time waster. I’d pay a few bucks for it to get rid of the ads. As it is, the ads are endless and incessant."
2,SBIIRO,The progress is toooo slow even if u watch ads to speed it up
1,Greentea311,This game is actually so bad all you do is grind until you get to the next era and then you beat the last era and repeat.  It’s so boring it’s almost impossible to not quit after you get to Sparta.
2,MrKiko44,Would love this game if the purchase 1.5 times speed button worked tired of watching ads for a 5min buff
1,Gamer_Boǐ,I opened the game for the first time and was shown that I had 1/250 of the enemy’s health and food production! I also noticed that it is so hard to upgrade I played for 20 min and couldn’t even beat the first battle
1,Realpersonrealreviews,The games literally sets you up for fail the moment you start playing and u have to grind forever just to stand a chance
4,Eltuh,It’s really a great game but it takes WAY too long to upgrade stuff
4,Joe42346474,Good for getting through down time
4,Ohbudbudbud,"I’ve had a lot of fun with this game I’m on timeline 120 or so, would like to see new eras or hero’s."
1,DaEMF11,At least half of the time I watch an ad to get a boost it just spins indefinitely and I get nothing and waste my time. Happens WAY too often
4,BeyondPro,So hard on iPad
1,Kc_lowry,I did like to play this game about once a day or so but they got rid of the game speed increase so it is so slow i get bored before the fighting even starts.
1,emberburns,I quit after the first battle. It took 10 tries to get past. The game kept asking to watch ads to get the necessary resources to win. This game is horrible.
4,12fahsb,"This game is so fun, I’d pay for it if I didn’t have to watch ads in it."
1,Connor Wansink,Little gameplay and progression is incredibly slow without watching multiple ads a level
5,REIYEN STALLINGS,This games is very skibidi sigma and the only complaint I have is it made me lose my edge streak.
3,dh777777777777777,Simple mind numbing pleasure. But the pause button doesn’t work.
5,Survivor361,"This game is cool, giving it five stars"
5,Uygguh,I love the idea and I am always playing the game🤪
2,SouthEnd62B8,To much health for the first level you can’t even beat it it’s to hard like lower the  health for the first level it’s to hard
2,Jeff Monquetes,This game might as well be called Idle We Are Warriors i am thankful tho that there are at least no ads
5,Best game ever it’s for all,No adds unless you 2x monkey or 1x2 time and super fun I really like this game
1,Xx239,This game is impossible to win without watching ads. I’ve had the game for 10 mins and still haven’t beat the first level. Don’t bother. This is a shovel game.
1,lincon_review,"This game was a ridiculous waste of time! The game is rigged from the start. No ads, but the grind isn’t fun by any means! Don’t waste your time, don’t know how this game is getting ratings higher then a 3 star."
3,bwadboilovesmsm,You should lower the hardness on level 1 also add coin extras as a upgrade
1,Lillaena,"Downloaded the game because it looked interesting, but you start out a lvl 2 base against a lvl 500 base are you kidding? And the only way to progress is to double the gold by watching ads. Trash and deleted byeeeeee"
4,zai/idontknow,But if u are looking for a challenging game this is it  no adds I don’t think 😂 but it’s a fun game
3,Vaderchef,There was a glitch with me upgrading my base saying it was 222 coins and I had 222 coins and it just won’t buy
5,Spookydevin11,this is one of the best mobile games on the app store
1,bigjhonson69,This game is trash takes too long an I hate constantly dieing either make the bases more speed apart or make the food timer more faster when u upgrade.
1,J3PO4U,Please don’t waste any time on this game. Anything micro transaction game filled with ads to watch that never end. The game makes you lose all the time. Best bet. Stay off the app game.
4,cseeyipkmvcdqeuiknvf,I’m still early in the game but please add an ad to watch to speed it up?
5,DickensTheCat,I it SO fun. My bro loves it. He would give anything for it. :)
1,Ejchjaisisjfjfsjwu,Sometimes I would not be able to get my reward after watching a ad and then I would not get my reward at all
1,mane_fox,It’s been 2 to 3 updates now and my dungeon key still will not respond in the daily quest have not come back is anybody else having these problems
4,The evolution of ads,"Well, then count me out"
5,amogusfarthead,I have been grinding for 237 days straight no sleep
5,Why do I need a nickname4838,This is the best plane game ever and I will be playing this game after this review!!
2,alastor gonez,"It costs so much to speed up the food to spawn the characters,and takes way too long"
5,The oh me guts,Way more fun than I thought
2,Dracnoius,Do you like watching an ad that lasts 40 seconds every two minutes? This is your game.
4,GametPro1201,It’s a really good game compared to other mobile games
5,Jallenfrost10813,This game is really cool I love it and the graphics look really good and the gameplay is so awesome.
1,JimbomanK,Do you enjoy watching ads? Do you want to BE the product? Then here you go! No progress can be made unless you watch an ad every 30 sec. So have fun with those ads!
5,tommytoney,This game is fun that you can play for hours!
5,Cinnamonroll_forlife,This is the best game for when you are bored or just want to play a fighting game.
4,lan776,Do it cowards
1,lanelee15,Progression is way too slow unless you want to watch two 30 second ads every battle
5,dtmm122,Decent game honesth
1,HyroGliphikz,What a drag to the start of this game and overall its just lame how in the first wave its already 2 vs 500. As well as the amount of advertisements that just takes way from the game is even more wack
1,saidmoglu,Watching ad to double coins gets stuck after watching. Lose original coins as well.
1,neveragain123456,I have been on level 20 summoning for a loooooong time. Still do not have all the cards. I reached out to support and they said “drops are chance and random”.
5,Doxchurn,It’s super good but you have to be patient
4,Fjtfb,"It's really fun., not much adds, but pretty hard."
1,Gore346477,"Get ready for a 100 losses to start, it’s a constant watch videos and you still lose, game. I like the concept but it’s flawed at the start. 1 guy VS 1-4 men"
1,Kookies38,It’s just an Ad watching simulator for the most part. At first I thought it would be like the old browser stickman war game but nope. Watch ads at every interval to speed up this slog game.
1,Bernzs,After playing for 30 minutes I started hating myself for enduring 30 minutes of advertisements.
2,EpicalJoe,Fun concept but I’d rather buy this full price and not have the stupid grind that makes you watch a million ads.
1,Nikolaijjahh,Game is straight trash. Unbeatable. No matter how much you play your always getting out matched by game. If you want to waste your life cool. There is an infinite number of mobile games way better
1,MJMarauder,"Want to lose every match you’re in, just to win once and reset your progress, this is the game for you."
4,Pay penguin,Good game but I think there is a missed add opportunity to have an add of then saying WE ARE WARRIORs but the we are farmers jingle at the end
1,Croppolis,Takes way to long to upgrade your meat supply to call in troops and you can only call in maybe 4 guys before your base gets destroyed.  Tearable game.
5,happywolfy11,I played it before class
1,ahabiby,Very slow moving so you waste a lot of time grinding  or watch ads to progress. Beginning of the game is pretty slow and boring
1,pix pix boom,When you reach timeline 4 you can go events but only do the unlocking troops part 1 if you try to beat the level you waste a lot of time that cannot be given back. On the other side great game.
1,RubberDon,"I bought everything I could with actual cash and I never received my triple coins or double coins forever, so basically this game was designed to steal from us. THIEVES"
4,Irvingc22,It has too much adds but it’s really cool
1,Hwkjfunw,"I’m playing the event and every time I’m gonna win the first battle it brings me back to the main screen, I’m spending so much time trying to beat it and it’s making me angry."
1,Gabenesssss,I hate this game after you guys removed the 2x speed. It’s to slow. Bring 2x speed back please. I paid for it which means I wanted it. I don’t know why yall took it out.
2,Cali5678,They got rid of speed boosts and now the game is so slow and annoying. I hope they reverse that decision because it’s really not that fun to play now.
2,Parabola9000,No more daily quests or challenges since newest update
1,Breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh,This game is too hard I can’t even get past level 1 the enemy’s can one shot your base wen you start the game and it is too impossible
1,Mikec55,The make it so that you must grind for hours to level anything up or you can watch dozens of ads. No thank you.
1,Mac MacMic,It takes a long time to progress. You want people to pay with these graphics yeah no.
3,wisegirly🥭,"So it’s really fun but challenging and no you do not have to be willing to pay, it is hard but fun!"
2,I-Cant-Find-ANickname,The bots and the player balance is too leaning for the bots. Fix it because I don’t like it when 8 Calvary men slowly walk too my helpless thrower
1,ItsEtrac,"Fun game, just wish you could enjoy it without an ad every 30 seconds. Literally every 30 seconds. Devs are farming ads it’s kind of sad."
1,HiiCeeno,It would be a great game if everything wasn’t dependent on watching ads. Which is fair because it’s a free game but they don’t even give you any power ups to beat the games AI. Not worth it!!!
1,Dracodad,The ad that made me get it isn’t even part of the game.  The enemy upgrades right along with you so that you never have the advantage unless you keep cranking to evolve above. A waste of time
4,Games_Are_Good,"It’s a very interesting game, but it’s really hard to win a battle."
5,TheC69420,One of the best mobile games out there
1,unknown_town13,Too way to much enemies when trying to destroy the castle impossible to win when having the production and troops are to respond slow
5,Hello1378T,Once you get passed Stone Age it’s a breeze great game and fun when bored
5,Liam Zalesky,The game never runs out of stuff to do and NO POP UP ADDS!!!
2,Brian Leighty,While some may enjoy how hard it is it feels like way too much of grind
1,Sophie26773389:,"If you play on your phone and your iPad it doesn’t link the two games, you start all over"
5,Dnjgfrderftvbhnhygtfr5ty,I beat timeline 7  it was spiausing and wet back to timeline 1
1,Dominic Toretto 1,Come up with more guys to unlock and everything else I can make games better than you
1,jphillipw,So frustrating. It’s a difficult game and then to lose progress.
5,gausgxjxu,Its sooo fun and i just won my first battle!!
1,Kjnman,"Started out fine, then after watching an ad (only way to level up w/o money) game locks up and you lose rewards. Deleted."
5,now quarter feet of PCs,10 out of 10
1,Mindreader691,"Bought the big event package but lost the 50% fish and also the event is not stable , was thrown out several times in mid play"
1,turbinski2000,"Game used to be a fun way to pass the time. But now it crashes way too often, usually ricin the middle of a match."
5,LukeI poki,Best game I have ever played with my friends
5,MacGuyDVD,It’s my new favorite game and super fun
1,DZ511,"I can’t play the game well, because I am unable to see some of the buttons and make certain selections on my iPad"
1,qnshdixbfjzzbx,Cool concept but so boring. I don’t want to sit here for hours after adds to get through a few levels. Not really a strategy game at all.
1,HokieFan#1,"Cool game, but ads are too long and too many. Don’t bother paying for anything, they will still force you to watch Ads…"
2,Definitely not sam,Incredibly slow game play almost forced you to watch every ad.
2,SawHasFeet,"Would take hours without watching ads, I’ll still play it but god it’s annoying 😭"
1,Jdjdjdjdjkxkkkxkwj,"Unlike the games that inspired this one like Age of War, this one requires no skill whatsoever and only requires you to click a button every five seconds. It’s an idle simulator you have to actively play."
5,Sweetpea mama bear,"I love this game soooooo much I highly recommend it, it is so addictive I hop you enjoy it as much as me!"
2,34556)gbnksieosi,Time killer or pay to win. Gets boring really quick. I don’t recommend unless you’re super bored.
1,Lucid Solaire,This game is a rip on The Battle Cats but it’s not even close to how well done The Battle Cats is and you have to constantly watch ads in order to make any real progress.
1,solo20bomb,Very hard beginning not too many ways to upgrade except for grinding
4,hshajanbs1234,The game is great but I no longer have the daily quests or the keys for the zombie battles.
1,Voncarp00,If you beat a level too fast then you can’t any points on the next level because they kill you in one shot
3,shattered58,There is very little Strategy if any.
5,ohppll,amazing if your still in elementary school plus modern age is amazing this is absolutely incredible its now all i play
1,TK 4218,"The game is OK but when I started playing this, it was so unfair. I had maybe one Health and the other person at 100 you don’t even start out with maybe a heart three opponent"
2,wings of fire is awesome 1349,I played the first level and it took me 1 hour to pass level 1 please make it easier to pass level 1
3,Wishing more for the game,I wish you could interact with your troops more
2,{Siricjr},Some times ads will not have exit so I closed game out an don’t get my dang coins :(
2,lolzieszzzzzzdhdgv chick,It was fun at the start I guess but it just takes so long to upgrade and honestly I regret even downloading it.
5,defferent jolly guy,"I beat first battle, I am crying, best game 10/10 I am gyatting it’s so good merry rizzmas everybody"
1,please fix this. thank you,"This game is horrible, it is impossible to win without playing for a long time while upgrading so much that you have no money to progress with!!!"
5,stoer420,It’s a good game it is pretty simple and there is a surpriseing amount of strategy
1,player91640,Most disappointing game I’ve ever played. Takes way too long to beat just the first level. I’ve been on it for a week
4,falsymmetry,Super fun game. But would really enjoy some better art
5,Reindeer VR,It is so fun you must play it
5,acvjvxy,It’s not like the ads but super fun and easy also pls add sandbox
2,l12111,This is not even fun anymore with how slow it is to progress. Can't stand it
1,Reporter001_,You start permanently loosing. You have no chance of winning. After two games I gave up.  Seriously guys: Get some game testers to avoid a disaster like this!
2,Too way to hard,It’s super hard and I’m above 9 years old I do not recommend for people with anger issues.
1,BKbray,"In one of it or all of its ads lie like I thought I would be able to battle in a sandbox type of game not have to earn my way up. I just installed this too. Relax, not to stress out."
5,unicornrex7,I think that this game is an amazing game. There is so much to this game that makes it fun.
1,VladimirTs,It’s a copy paste of well known game except this game is painfully slow and you’re forced to watch ads to make any meaningful progress.
5,Dodofirififofo,Me and my cousins enjoy playing this game a lot😁
5,Braedededen,Great way to spend ur day playing a game!
5,Patriot4Liberty,I had no problem with the ad's
5,𝖳𝗋𝗎𝖾𝖶𝗈𝗋𝗄,Super fun even though it’s super simple. Love it!
5,Gmoney kitten awwww,This game is a great time killer and is fun over all highly recommend
3,Pelacara,Good game. But now I can’t play it. It autocrashes every time I try to open the game
5,Lolllll. Nice,Not bad pretty good I don’t care about. Ads
5,The best1 ever ever,Best game easy no adds
1,Hhgfddsddvbjkhfdcvhffg,After playing for months I haven’t seen any real updates ever just like all their other games
5,MacBurget,i always play fake games that are very boring. me and my dad have been playing this all the time on vacation when we have free time.
3,Free tv hehe bob billy,I genuinely can’t get past the first level like erm what the sigma
1,SupersaiyanX274,Literally the stupidest game I ever played . I can’t even get past the first level of the game. little bit of advice people don’t like it we the first stage is too hard to play
5,Call of duty is best,ITS THE BEST GAME it would be better if you gave me 100k coins
1,Prowl_clone,Like the progression of this game is so freaking slow. Like I lose interest everytime I play the game and I just go a different game. please make it better and easier to win rounds
1,Count Bendy man,"This game has done everything it can to make progress slow, it’s just painful to play really"
2,why you looking here,Really great game idea but it’s so slow and impossible to upgrade it’s not worth spending time on
2,Keegan OD,The ad for this game looked super fun until I got it now I’ve not been able to complete the first battle because of how much better the AI is than starters like me
1,KaptinKooshTv,Titles says enough games trash all the 5 starts were almost definitely paid for
4,Jacefart,Love it best game I have though I wish evolving was more cheaper
5,Yeazzal,I like the art style here and it’s a good game
1,Kreyton.,"Fun game, but super slow progression but you don’t need ads to win. But they need to add a way where you can constantly progress when your weaker then the other units."
1,KH697,The only way to beat the first stage is to spend money. It’s another game destroyed by micro transactions. I would’ve played this game a ton too.
5,The Bible app is easy to use,Fun+hard best mobile game
5,HYELOOOOOOO,it is wayyy too expensive! I mean that 100%! No! 1000%! MAKE IT CHEAPER NOW
3,W1LDER,I opened the app today and all of my progress was deleted.
5,luisflores94,It’s a good game and it’s challenging and fun with all the characters
4,DHZ17123,"Good for long car rides, must watch adds to progress fast"
1,coakcloud,"Make a no ads paid option, this is judicious. Make it affordable, if it’s $15 in deleting the game."
5,BobTheBuilder#1TheOG,Like I said really fun and it’s offline
5,Pic we,It’s a good game and you don’t need a good phone to play
2,_-Dusseldorf-_,"That’s pretty much it. Not enough to the game to be worth it.   Just another thing designed to build revenue by forcing its players to pointlessly grind away and watch ads.  Ads aren’t forced though, so if you like hitting 3 buttons with essentially no strategy to it for hours on end, this is the game for you."
3,mrcool69420,"Eventually, if you don’t win an event, or pay, it becomes unplayable."
5,Thelamaguy,This is a good game no bugs or glitches just fun
3,WizardlyJB,"Game would be perfect with a turret function, overall great and fun but missing that final piece in my opinion."
5,JJRavenClaw112,Great game can’t stop playing it
5,poke champ brother,Honestly good game it should be downloaded more
3,no volume button,Ad watching simulator. only good to pass time. (Its better than nothing)
5,Eman12344038477392,Too fun so much things to do
4,"his holiness, Jesus Christ","This game is a normal economy grower , and reminds me of Age Of War on browser. A very good game!"
1,BogZ13,Money Hungry typical phone games. Not a bad game just very slow advancements and same characters no changes in characters besides the  PAY TO WIN Events.
2,cchhppos,this game is fun but it to hard for the new players like 500 health for the enemies and we start with 1? Pls make it easier
5,082847401819375693529201,Just pkay the game give it a try
5,Beanlysoccer,Everyone needs this game it really good
5,Joæ.,"Only optional ads and it’s very fun, good time waster, and best of all… THERES MORE THAN AN HOUR OF GAMEPLAY WITH NO RANDOM ADS"
5,Berry2scary,Have been playing for 3 days. It’s fun
1,Realest Alive,Unbelievable that one of the daily missions is to “watch 5 ads”. Money hungry developers. Uninstalled as soon as I seen it pop up
5,Graeme Stevenson,This game is super good but it needs less ads
1,Night5775,Too many ads and pay to win
2,Qaaaack,"In a game about strategy and skill this newest update added a gambling wheel, would be a 5 if not for that."
1,Katsurousan,"The last few updates have broken the refreshes for daily quests and keys. Please fix, unplayable atm. No progression."
1,Chad818181,"What happened with the last update? Also, when is something new gonna happen on the game?"
3,USNMP,"Honestly it’s a kind of fun mindless game, my son loves it. Paid for ad free and guess what? Still ads all around!!!"
1,Jacklyn3232,"I really want to love this game but it doesn't view properly and I can't up grade overall health, &  no matter how much I fight I am always on the same battle"
1,NyxTango,Extremely slow to start to even begin to make the game playable. I played 10 games and STILL didn’t touch the enemy base. Absolutely terrible games.
5,Thank you so much for game,Love the game and my favorite YouTuber played it
5,dhddyyd,No ads…. the hours I have spent on this game
1,Dwaynegerous,Not only slow but your always watching adds like the game isn’t worth your time.
1,Thus game booty,If the comments say great game or five stars it’s problay just paid people to say it’s good or ai it could also just be the games early version that didint have unfair gameplay or ADS.
4,MAXIMO1217,Good game with too much ads
1,EricRand17,"Ads everywhere, and they’ll barely do anything for you. The progression is insanely slow, very tedious game."
5,Retierashi,The game is almost like Stick Wars. <3
2,jxthe1st,"basically need ads to win n the prices arent worth the value (still bought sum n i regret it) and half the time the ads break and prevent me from closing them so i gotta reset the game lose wtv i watched the ad for n if you had a good run you wanted to double, you lose that"
1,Computer Gnome,Even after watch 15 ads to boost my food and evolution I still can’t beat battle one. What a waste of time and discouraging to play
5,Bob the rock jr,It was just like the add a game that didn’t lie about the game
1,kirk mcdougles,"There is a weekly race event, and if you are new you don’t get the option for the speed boost. Legacy players do and you are at a big disadvantage. Avoid"
1,i6ww,freezing on loading page please fix the issue
3,Anysis,From the last update game became bad! If u have bad internet u will wait and wait!
3,Broisky,No adds only if you want to watch them
5,Bullfrogja,Is very entertaining and enjoyable.
5,kayson mcmains,This game is fun but they could add a little more animation to it
5,Aydens star review,It is so fun but maybe a speed boost for the prodution can be buft so yea good game
5,isieisu,"Love it, so fun and addictive!!!"
1,Ball neck,How this game got 4 stars is beyond me. Literally watched five 30 second ads within the first 7 minutes of playing the game.
5,I’m j🍱🍱✅✅,Good and hard but good you should play
5,Hbhybfd34678,Way too addictive
5,Bigardner was here,It’s amazing I love it and I’m 11 it’s now my favorite game
2,Eth2023thbd,500 hp like what!!! Like that is ridiculous 👿👎 but I am not trying to hate on the game. I am just saying that you should nerf the health
1,Lorller2,Not really worth the amount of time you need to play to beat this game. Not sure where all these 5 starts coming from.
4,Chicken nuggets 78,The game is incredible it fun to play and actually changing
2,Lazy punk,You should get a reward for destroying a base at least. Maybe some other upgrades
1,Dave OGrosky,It doesn’t make sense that you have to have summoning coins and that’s all you get not the coins to buy your army and that kind of stuff so this is a stupid game
3,Phaedrus2002,"The game itself is ok, but the dev tries way to hard to get you to watch ads"
1,Irrelevant Racoon,"Zero stars if I could, this game is practically unplayable without constantly being taxed with 30 second ads. Do not download, not even able to idle play."
1,zeemoozeekgeek,Graphics are cool but it’s way too hard early on to beat without watching a ton of ads. No thank you!
1,RunTowardsDanger,Same boring stuff every level. Don't waste your time.
1,ZozoSush,If you don’t watch ads then it will start forcing ads on you after you get to the second level. Take this L
2,Shumblloo,This would be a 4 maybe 5 star game if it didn’t spring ads on me until asked.
3,Grimmly96,It makes no sense at all why the cpu spawns in 2x as more than me… it’s really frustrating
5,:) 🍪,Amazing offline game for everyone and it is challenging
1,Freddy B. fetch,Are there any games out like We Are Warriors but doesn’t drag the progress out? I would love to check it out
5,Chicken noodle bucket,Simple game but great exacution  needs lots of strategy
5,Nick her12,This game is very fun and like only optional ads
1,Evan Wiebe,You can spend 20 minutes playing and not make any progress without watching ads.
1,Camtom.,Game play is divided up between watching ads and losing till you watch enough ads. Truly mindless game of looping you into watching more ads. Unplayable
1,MCAwesomeWild,Full of ads and could be made better on scratch
1,Fire Bear,"Not to be too picky, but, a pause button that doesn’t pause the game seems fairly useless."
1,d.pwner,"Auto delete, I could use many more words to describe but probably won’t be uploaded. Don’t even bother to download"
1,Prometheus-121,"0 decisions. 0 fun. Just grind. Grind all the time. Tap the button. Repeat the same level 10,000 times, get gold, buy 0.2% food production, repeat 10,009 more times. It’s so ridiculously unfun."
4,Damariobaby,"1. More eras fore example, ancient Egypt, cowboy, revolutionary.  2. New upgrades."
5,kaixo2002,"It’s really good, just do it."
1,Apollyon-,"Game makes you start SUPER WEAK! You have to play for upgrade for at least an hour to atart winning. Once you age evolve, guess what?! You lose all your upgrades and atart from the bottom. imo, GAME’S NOT WORTH THE TIME"
1,callMePhilip,"Daily tasks and dungeon keys are broken in recent update, not worth playing anymore."
1,IwiLLmakeithurt,False advertisement on 99.9% of the ads played. The progression is stupidly slow. Why’d I even download this brain dead version of age of war?
2,blogplayer,In the ads it doesn’t look like it when I download it
1,DPF-ALASKA,"Wonderful ad watching platform, with occasional bit of gameplay sprinkled in for some reason."
3,WAWPlayer,Completed Battle 6 TWICE and it still wouldn’t let me pass. Fix ur game bums
1,nickname92748293,"I would like the game as a time killer, but I spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Not worth it any more."

1,Justhadsexxxx,"Slow, nothing special."
2,00tallgeese,They’re invulnerable and wipe out your assault? Please fix this. Wasting time in our lives where we can be enjoying a fun game

1,Dominic18181818292992,I first start and level 1 has 500 hp I got 2 and the bad guys get 10 meat a second I get like 1 meat a second   Very bad game 0/10 would not recommend
4,roboliam,This game is good with the Grinding but I wish it was more like stick man games
2,R_R_R_R_R,"This game is good, but it took me like 3 days to finish the farm age, if you see this please make the game easier, thank you."
1,Mr Hickle,They got rid of the only redeeming feature of this game.  You can no longer an ad to speed the game up. It was a nice feature but now it’s gone. R.I.P.
5,Dante's rule,It’s a really
1,Nah I’d lose,When you first spawn into the game you have 1 hp on you’re haste and the other one has 500. So there for you can’t kill it
1,Pwnstr,"Really cool idea, incredibly shafted by ADs. Expect a better version of this with half the ADs in the next few weeks."
1,Masquerade420,You have to sit and watch AI destroy you over and over again until you watch ads non stop.
4,Linda luna75,But its good
1,PhoenixKam714,Daily quest makes you watch ads. Most are optional but they are long. At least throw a $5 remove ad thing in here.
1,boyblue521991,Definitely won’t be recommending to anyone
5,JCD24765142,Love this game
1,CeeRaw941,"Mindless, repetitive levels regardless of the “age” or whatever that you’re in. I feel dumb that I bought a $15 pack for this lol   We live and we learn"
2,picketfence14,Ruins multiplier bonuses for watching ads
1,mdienfnxowndnd,"Follows the exact same patterns. Lose lose lose, eventually get the strongest unit and then spam till you win"
5,1blockatatime,It is so fun that my parents even are playing it.I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE GREAT NEW FUN GAMES LIKE THIS 😎😎
5,patnumber11,This game is sooo good I can't believe how good it is chefs kiss
1,Frankiewas,I dont like watching ads. I really dont like watching ads that are broken forcing me to close the app
1,Alex76891,This is ad simulator. I spent about 40 bucks in 1 day and got to timeline 6 in just 10 hours… it’s not worth it.
1,abdul_7amid,"After time line 15 is very hard game, you shuld buy from store to can play. Its not stratgy game, its shop game. i delete it after (timeline 21)."
1,Worhaven,Game is just a rip off of an old flash game but instead of fun it’s jam packed with ads forced in your face the entire time you are playing
4,cooke257,I love this game it is so entertaining and fun and you do get the nice little stress
1,Jackaroho,This game is terrible don’t play it unless you have no life and nothing better to do if I could I would rate it negative 5 stars
2,ccw.2018,U can’t even beat level 1 unless u watch ads
5,That Grandma 69,W in my opinion
1,citohuerta,It literally makes you always loose at the start which makes it impossible to beat it and so hard to get coins
4,Nfhdhdurhdhfhdhdudhdhx,Fun to play when you are bored
1,BJ Lois,1. Total ad revenue farm 2. Really lousy starting stats 3. Upgrades don’t carry over with each evolution
5,fnaf fan 337,This is an amazing stress reliever and it’s fun this game is awesome check it out
4,FNaF fan gggggggg,I like this game BUT I don’t like how the NPCs are so overpowered I can’t win once
1,Ale_TheOne,This game would actually be enjoyable and fun if it wasn’t literally just ads every 3 seconds! WAY TO MANY ADS!!!!! It doesn’t make it enjoyable!
5,MEEPERTOP,Everytime i look at this it reminds me of WW2
2,fantasteclilman,It’s a fun game in general fun characters fun gimmick but otherwise it’s rigged every level you have to play so many times just to get one thing and THE OPPONENT GETS 3 TRILLION FOOD IN 1 SECOND SO ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PAST TIMELINE 1.
5,Seedffseessx,Please add more to this game I’m really enjoying it
5,APN168,Why does the solider not have a melle stack? It has the knife on the gun.
1,lachkalex,Good game on paper but FORCE you to watch ads if you want to progress / beat the computer
3,Jayce12345678910,It great but the thing is you make the first generation sooooooo hard
1,Morg6756,Devs have ruined the grind and took out daily goals for seemingly no reason I won’t be playing again until they’re reintroduced
5,Love dragon city 100,This game is a mix of fun and battle and I realy enjoy it
1,slipstreamtx,"It’s ads online don’t align with gameplay. At all.  Dull, repetitive, uninspiring.  Timeline 8 loops timeline 1 content. Stopped there. Same stuff over and over."
1,Garbygarb1238,It’s just stuck on loading . So you’re literally stuck because you can’t watch ads
5,austin1 10 15,There like no ads
5,Niceguy1084,It’s a good game for young people and can be really fun
5,hfgtghf,Its a challenging game an i like that. Its a great game and i love ot
3,Glitchbunny,Fun game but the ads ruin it
1,ttjoshtt,The game slows way way way way down unless you pay dollars and even when you do there’s still ads!!!
2,CollegeRailroader,No way to win unless you watch ads all the time.
5,Kawasakikago,Really fun for no WiFi or WiFi.
5,Teegan Cartwright,It’s the best game I played but they should add animations on the dino
1,ETS194&4729,"Absolutely mindless grinder with slow progression of abilities requiring many many redos to accrue enough coins to move forward. Maddeningly dumb waste of time, save yours."
1,Hawxeyez,Avoid this game. It takes far too long to grind to even stand a chance against ai enemies. Limited time events are even worse
1,Ionel the jef,"Ads, Ads, and more Ads. Impossible to beat. Not fun unless you watch ads for power ups. So boring."
5,everyone better do this,I got this game yesterday and I love it it keeps me interested and invested
2,RemoteMusic999,"Nice game and concept, but it's very imbalanced. Be ready to watch a lot of ads to make little to no progress."
5,about that I am a,I love this game so much
1,LurveApps,"Fun initial concept, but the number of ads vs. gameplay time is intolerable."
5,demonio_salvato,Better than Fortnite
2,Macmikeking,It takes so long to progress in the game and the ads are terrible.
1,Stuntz816,The amount of battles you have to participate in is pretty bad and the enemy just throws waves of people at you.
1,JAGtheBeast3_YT,I don’t recommend this the fights are not and there are so many add (or say add to win) I guess you have to play for hours to make the game fun
1,ReaperZ_,I’m sure it gets fun after a while but why is the first battle so hard
4,Dollar store Luffy,Great game with a simple gameplay great for travel to but is a little repetitive
5,Twixx_bar._.,Best gam Ive ever downloaded its so good!!! I got my friend to play to
3,Jackosta,This game is nice No ads unless you ask for them But the grinding is insanely tiring
5,amimisaurus,such a fun and good game!! i can’t stop playing it!!! i havent left my room in weeks!!! #bedrot
5,warfare kid,Fun but hard
1,Andy42tak,This game could be fun but adds literally every few seconds. Uninstalling
3,Idc. Idk fun game,It was fun but I couldn't  watch the 5th ad
1,dakotag,Could be fun but you have to watch dozens of ads to get anywhere. Very slow gameplay
1,hdinwksifbned,"You need to grind an excessive amount of time to match the skill of your opponent. Your base starts with 2hp and your opponents is 500hp. Not fair, and it is so expensive to upgrade things. Do not reccomend."
5,FrugWasHere,fun and doesnt have ads (unless you want to to get extra stuff) and is just a great game to pass time
1,Corgester,Terrible game they just want you to watch adds only way to win
5,Ttttttttttx10653468,There is no adds
1,Barf12485892@585,Ads to double rewards about 1/4 of the time won’t work and you don’t get any rewards.
5,Sunngifu,It is very fun though there are ads.
3,Punky.Joe,Slow progression 2-3 hours of fun
1,Sgerto,Recent updates crashed the daily goals and daily challenges.   Try to notify devs and they ignore you. Fun game becoming demotivating.
2,xlassassinlx,Fun but even when you pay money there are way to many ads. Ruins the game
5,Makel Jackson,It is so fun you get to spawn troops and level up good job
1,Manning1234567,It requires you to watch so many ads. If you want to waste your life and time on this feel free to do so
1,Lololilolooiluiud,"Don’t waste your time with this game, it’s not worth playing"
4,ghbifvkh,Game is fun. not as much ads as I thought.
3,Dylanp225,This game is nothing other than an ad simulator
1,alexa_Elaine,Why is it so hard to progress through the game? Literally the first level the AI beats you every single time
1,ixtcc,- near impossible progression with focus on watching ads to make it slightly better  -very repetitive  -just awful genuinely
1,64ct. box of Crayons,"The game is based on a fundamentally un-fun mechanic. No skill, no luck, just spending a bunch of money or watching adds to win. Do not play this game."
1,ThatWebSlinger,Horrible game when you upgrade you lose all your progress makes no sense
5,jfkdjdifjrn,Wow I am shocked at how much I love this game you NEED to get it!!!!
1,Hansbcgdjjenshcvjsjsj,Takes too much time to level up.
1,Sam192748282,This game is geared toward kids from 6-10 years old. Very basic gameplay and extremely repetitive.
5,DaVilan-_-,👆
2,Cake_Commander,"As the title says, the game progression is incredibly slow"
1,Yeaboi123,They make it so it’s better to watch ads for rewards than to play the actual game.
5,hydnzjx,Really good game
1,Blaqwolf2,"Should be the name of the game, spend more time watching ads than actually playing. Back to Royal Clash for me"
1,Sebejex,"This game is awesome, but there is really nothjng to do anymore. It has become monotone and there is no point to it reall. The events have no competition (meaning i am the only one competing)."
1,AppleAirplay,"This ‘game’ is a pathetic visual copy of an old flash game. The ads they deliver are despicable, and the gameplay has been entirely removed. It’s just an advertisement delivery platform"
1,CaymanRich,I watched an obnoxiously long ad for this game and it’s nothing like the ad. Here’s your one star for making me waste my time.
2,29LC,Watch ads to win or grind away forever.
1,IzthereviewWiz,Bad clone of a great game. This one is designed to be boring unless you give them ad revenue. Most of the positive reviews are likely bots because this game is just not fun
1,Cane2332,They force you to watch ads or progress slower then a snail uphill and this is no exaggeration prepare to only lose never win
4,lil yeeeet,i started the game today and i think adding this ideas would be good :  - keep tapping ur screen to get a boost in food so like it still automatically gives u food but then if u click u get extra food  -nerf the enemies i just beat the first level but it took 16+ tries  -100 extra creds upon destroying the enemies base  review : games fun and addictive but at first its kinda hard to play.
4,youcx,At first it’s really slow tho
5,I luv dog,The only fun mobile game
1,Dakari😡,The game is bad the entire enimes have Dino’s while we have clubman so fix your game like your weird I don’t know how people like you like ugh
1,fdbwf,"Very slow progression, boring and frustrating when same troops from enemy are more effective than my own"
1,Jay Young12,"It’s so poorly made to force you to wait, upgrade to next tier and beat the last tier with upgraded unit. Makes no sense."
4,Nieriel,"I THOUGHT this was basically a cookie clicker, which it is to a degree. But the key to progressing through the levels is being willing to  - strategize - grind - be patient   I like! I like!"
5,People2356,I like it very much.
2,casper_td,Now the app just crashes everytime I open it
2,ThomTissy,They removed the game speed up option and now it is unplayable.  Was really fun at 1.5 and 2x.
1,tommy 2toner,Played the game on and off for a few days and its honestly got one of the most abusive ad structures I’ve ever experienced.
2,Gunit3365,Was a great game and they removed game speed and now it’s very slow and honestly very boring sad to see a great game get destroyed
1,user374958273,What kind of game forces you to start off by losing unless you watch ads to win.
1,ghnuejiejdidjidi,It takes too long and it's boring and the upgrades are too expensive.  So I hate it
1,Guruspeaker,Too many ads. Way too many.   Could be a good game but ads kill it.
1,yeet17373737722,If you guys want tips on how to actually make a good game here to start make it so we can get past the first level
1,Shoez123,Watching the ads is more fun than actually playing the game.
1,JeepRubiJl18,To many adds it’s becoming really annoying take that add out
1,Nonamesavailable5776322467,No progress without watching a ton of ads
1,Kyle8282,"This game is basically an ad watching simulator, the gameplay is poor and they just want our ad revenue."
4,wd rg,(Review)
5,Redsoxboy1194,Slow but great game
1,$Nash,Game is ok but you can’t level up if you don’t watch ads
1,LackadaisicalMom,App age range is 9+ yet there are very inappropriate ads. I would buy an ad free version because my kid loves this game- but I can’t find one.
4,HOMGRY,It is what it is make food regen faster or lower troop cost.
1,24DNPH,Spending money gives way too much advantage
1,andre69000,Its a great concept and not the worst game but you need to watch ads to progress   There are plenty of base defense games that are better
2,Blazecc,Hope that gets fixed eventually
1,Cheesecakrr,"Ok, so when you play the first level of this game theres overpowered guys there and it’s impossible to beat and SUPER ANNOYING! Please make it easier and i might rate 5 stars."
1,Jgisnwnkxncn,Ads galore and repetitive timeline. Be ready to spend money if you don’t want to grind a slow paced game. Did I mention ads?
5,KiNGx_DraKe,Fun little game! good at passing time.
5,xXFrxnchTxastXx,Im addicted
1,Mike12334321,The game used to be fun with the speed boosts but once removed the game is incredibly boring and a pain to get through timelines

5,Mark mari,Love this game it’s so addictive and satisfying get it
5,♋️🫵🥵,I'm real but this is low key
1,IFunny Tag,From upgrades to attacks it’s super slow (unless you use ads of course)
1,JakeKnobel,Literally impossible to beat a level without watching ads for bonus currency
5,Brickbunch,This game can be addictive but it’s fun
5,shehatesaram,just like the ad it’s great.
4,Hehe teeheetee eat me daddy,Very nice and kinda idk game its very fun and easy to learn how to play!
5,Foot728Fungus,make more ways to get gems and make level 1 easier so players wont leave the game
1,Gamer912838,You have to watch the add to win if you don’t it’s impossible
1,matthcoo,Its freezing the app and not giving the award causing you to reset and lose progress.
1,Wow123457,Took away the permanent speed boost I purchased and now the game drags. Just is not fun anymore. Do not buy anything from this group.
1,Djsiebtnidhskw,The new update is driving me crazy!!! I wish I did not update! T^T the older version was better.
1,Teehen31,Should be a version where we don’t have to watch ads
1,Phxraoh,Dungeon keys do not replenish “every day” I’ve had this game for 4 days now and only did 2 dungeons. Fix it
1,Deviltx1966,He thinks he will get rich if you watch 200 ads in an hour.  The game itself is not very good either.
1,Lord Cheesypuff,You have to watch every add to have any chance to win and even that won’t help.
5,Ruinme000-name-in-game,It is addicting…………………….
1,austin46225,This game is absolutely terrible. It is horrible made and has way two many ads.
1,_Drumax_,Title says it all. Far too slow with terrible reward system. I’m good with a simple game but at least make it a faster pace game.
1,Okdkddddd,Just a way to get you to watch ads no real strategy or improving in the game
4,Eatp00,It a fun game. It need to have a multiplayer or ranking system.
1,The Govern0r,You can’t win in a timely manner without watching at least 10 ads
5,djdjshhdd,Really simple but very fun. That is all I have to say… ITS FUN
5,avionhuntwrotethis,its a great way to pass time and is entertaining
5,gdhfjv,No ads no payments and super fun
5,I am champion! 1v1 me!,No adds forced on you!
4,from dogmanbest356,it took me 6 hours to complete the first battle and basically wasted my time
4,juwknq,Enough said
4,Big D Randy 1873,It’s a hood game when your bored. It’s simple but fun.
5,dragonquestfan221,I have no idea why but im addicted to this game.
1,Raknari,First level is slow and requires ads to progress at any normal pace. Ad simulator is a fitting description of this app.
1,ssuisi,I hate this game so much it’s so bad I can’t even pass level one
3,HoundDogs,Too many times npc hide behind their walls. 👎
5,:shhdbebzh,Bruh this is one of the best gams I ever played
2,Vnnunaki,I mean the game is dope and all but the ads for furries undressing was not the vibe I expected to see when downloading a game about cavemen
2,rhsksnsh,Even the troop progression is the same as age of war it’s just a more cash grabby version
4,Hidden man78,Great game takes forever to get good stuff
1,Alaing23,This game literally wouldn’t stop crashing. Deleted it immediately.
5,Fhghfhghfhgh,I love this game!!!
1,ıdkdxkdkdoxoıcxkks,"I paid for coin but nothing change, they stolen my money !"
1,Sagulls,You spend more time watching ads then you do playing the game.
1,Ґріґорій,Solitaire cash is bugging with infinite loop that you can’t x-out of. On purpose? One star until you fix it
1,Kayzenchaos,They removed the 2x speed and now the game just feels to slow for me.
5,Buttholeeatter🤣🤣,Griddle frfr
1,Abdiel-rkd,App doesn’t respect silent mode switch when playing ads. That’s an instant delete for me.
1,manowar2000,There’s basically no game to this game you just watch a lot of video ads!
5,777Jesus3,No forced adds excellent Performance.
1,Seencran,This game is trash. They start you so low on purpose so you have no choice but to spend money.
1,Concerned Citizen05,"This game is straight up boring, unoriginal, and money hungry. If you want to waste your life and get nothing out of it, this game is for you :)"
3,Kevcosgd,"Would be an awesome game, but it’s very reliant on ads for progression in a reasonable time."
5,BradleyLikesGames,"Let’s be honest, I’m adicted, I’m attached to this game like glue is to paper, AMAZING!"
1,Stillotto,Look for another game this thing feel like a bath of ads
1,RyZe VibeZ,"The progress is EXTREMLY slow, likes to steal money, and the gameplay is boring, deleted after 20 minutes"
1,Sankeyes,No more daily challenges. No more dungeon keys. Nothing. It’s pointless to play now that i can’t progress.
1,Aleksander prave Harrold,It’s impossible to beat and you never get a chance to when you are a starter
5,Mario🔥4982@374882@3748832748@,It’s a great game! I am very happy about the game
1,Katack88,I love this game. But the lack of handling hackers being top on every event kills it. New race event starts and someone if in time line 4 in 10 minutes… that’s a hacker…
5,midas12341234,This game is actually good App Store game it so fun
1,Ehpwiwu,"All you do is watch ads to progress, pointless game, not even fun at all"
2,Fortnite_IsTrash,You have to do 100 times to for it to be fun and the friend isn’t fun
1,Ckimbal213490,Game is literally built to force you to watch ads. It’s like eating a brown star that was never wiped clean.
3,Hdjdjddhcj,The game is ok but but it is hard when u are new
2,Ndgemshgnsmd,It’s not bad but the only thing is the other side is WAY!!!! to strong
5,Yoghfjrbfjdkebtj,Really fun but kind of challenging
1,ShawnboCombo,You will need to watch two ads per game to make reasonable progress
1,Spac3Ghost,You dont win. You just lose less. I went to the farm age and havent won a single battle

1,Ahmedmabd,Lol decided to delete it after 5 minutes
2,SadSpaceman84,"Been playing the game for about a week now. I can’t help myself when it comes to try-harding any game I play. The base game is fun overall, but it becomes apparent that the green card chips are mandatory for long term progress. In essence, the farther you go, the more noticeable it is that you must watch ads or pay money. The illusion of choice is yours. On the bright side, blue skill droplets are also mandatory, but they give a bunch of them as you progress FOR FREE. This is not tied to a day cycle. In all fairness, they give you a small amount of green card chips everyday, but it takes approximately five days to get enough for a worthwhile use. Overall, this portion of the game would be more of a 3.5 out of 5. HOWEVER, their challenge mode is ridiculous! The big issue is the limited time to defeat the challenge. While 3 days (this changes per event, but this is the most frequent I’ve seen) seems like a lot to time on paper, it is not in practice. This oversight forces the player to choice between the base game and the challenge as, in my opinion, there is no way to comfortably play both. In the Outer Space challenge I played, progress is slow and tedious. Your card buffs are disabled and both you and the digital opponent are on the same footing. This too is cool at first glance, but as the challenge goes not, it becomes unavoidable that you must win a mirror match while grinding tokens that disappear in three days and don’t add to the base game. The longer the challenge goes on, the more you feel the need to double up every token reward (like almost every other mobile game, they let you double your reward by watching an advertisement) weighs on you the deeper you progress. After I reached the third leg of the challenge, I watched an ad every single time (a play time of approximately 7 hours) in order to keep up. The only way to avoid watching ads is to watch other ads; they have a special ad you can watch TWICE A DAY (this really pisses me off) that front loads extra resources onto your food meter so you can muscle through the level. At the six hour and 50 minute mark, I used my last of the special ads to try to close the gap, but I lost out at THE very last moment (the goal post shifts with a lot of these games, I would like to say I was 98% finished with the challenge). I was destroyed. I have no way to retry as this resource only refills twice a day, meaning you only have six opportunities to pop it in the first place (I used several of mine during the campaign, illustrating my point that you cannot play both games). Overall, I watched literally a hundred advertisements today. I know what these games are and I don’t mind, just please don’t make me watch a hundred ads and then make me feel like a loser. I have already lost. Challenge mode is a 1 out of 5.   P.S.- The base game works smoothly with little to no bugs, however the challenge mode crashed on me several times. I believe it has something to do with the in-game notification, but I’m not sure. I hope this helps someone!"
5,Ryuthewloodenskyl,I love this game. I destroyed the opponents base finally.
3,Kaden Newsome,"There’s nothing to special about the game, it’s fun to play"

5,Not this game 134,This game is simple and fun I loved it!
4,163525,We need Chinese
5,My In Game Name is: TauRi,This is a generally fun game. It’s simple and easy to understand. It has very linear progression and can be “grindy” but that seems the point of the game. NO FORCED ADS is refreshing… there are adds you can watch after every battle to increase your gold gains which is extremely helpful but it’s NOT required … not even to progress. There will be times where you will hit a wall on not being able to progress and this can be rectified 2 ways. You can spend a little cash (nothing crazy) to make you stronger or you can just continue to log in daily and grind the level and eventually you will hit the required strength to move on.  There are events to keep you interested with rewards and these events do not require any purchases to complete however you can purchase special event packs to make it easier if you like. The multiplayer events that have you against others on the leaderboard are unique compared to most apps. What I mean by this is most apps it’s a PTW (Pay to Win) style competition. In this case when you enter the event you do not get your purchased buffs….aside from some things you can unlock naturally.  So the playing field is pretty even and it comes down to who has more time / grinds harder.  All in all I would give this game a 4.5-5 star review as it is exactly as it’s advertised to be. Does not require purchases … does not force ads … does not require purchase to remove ads… and is constantly being updated.  This game has lots of multiplayer event potential and is fun to play mindlessly while doing other things.   The only “negatives” would be that: It’s repetitive and grindy (which I don’t mind) You can hit walls that will feel unfair almost pushing you to buy packs to get stronger but remember you don’t have to do so to progress you just need patience.
5,Yoink_Fr,"Love this game, so fun, 5/5"

1,aschep16,When they got rid of the 1.5-2x speed they broke the game

1,Joemamatrydash2,"First ten minutes of the game gave me anxiety, if you haven't noticed, that is not what a game is supposed to do."
1,armyCH1023,I was really enjoying this game until I just got a political ad. No thanks. I’m out.

4,TarentLee,"5 Minutes in I have upgraded my Food Production to .56/s, 5 Base Health, and I have the Thrower. 10 Minutes in I have upgraded my Food Production to .62/s, and 7 Base Health. 15 Minutes in I have upgraded my Food production to .68/s, and 8 Base Health. 30 Minutes in I have upgraded my Food Production to .74/s, and 14 Base Health. After 1 hour I have unlocked the second age. I have upgraded 2nd age Food Production to .72/s, 7 Base Health, and I have the slinger  After one hours of playing this game, here’s my honest review. If you’re a person who likes playing games just to grind them, this is your game. If you aren’t that kind of person, then this probably isn’t your game. All of the stats I have listed above are including watching every ad I could (not including the ones in the shop) and playing with my best strategy. (I only play strategy games). Would I recommend this game to a normal person? Probably not. Would I recommend it if you’re bored out of your mind? Yes.  This last part is to the creators. As a game developer myself, you guys have done yourself well. But here are some things I would recommend. If you want to keep the slow paced battle style, instead of putting ads in battle to speed it up, just simply ad a switch to speed it up. Something such as 1x speed, 2x speed, and 3x speed, or something similar. If you want to have ads in your game to make revenue put them in the shop, and change it to something like different skins, or weekly rewards where the player can earn gems for playing a certain amount of time or killing an amount of enemies. I like that you have rewards in battle, if you don’t want to change it from in battle rewards then add different challenges to each age such as kill 20 slingers in a game etc. One of the main things that caught my eye was the design of the levels. I like that they change with each age but switch up the scenery too. You already changed the color of grass, changed the spawn, and moved the trees and rocks around, but add other things. Like different kinds of trees. For example keep how you have the Stone Age, but change the Farm Age so there is farms on the side, or a river, or sand on one side grass on the other. Something as simple as that goes a long way in attracting a player. That last thing I have to say is add more things to the shop. Whether it’s something like I mentioned earlier such as different character/weapon skins, or being able to trade gems for coins making the player want to complete those challenges to be able to upgrade faster. Which would also be helpful if you added weekly challenges so they can do more to earn more.  Overall it’s a good game. Not my favorite but not my least favorite. Can’t wait to see if the developers add anything I mentioned and what future updates have to come."

5,ThatBloonsPlayerBelike,We are warriors that are waring in da war
5,Hey Youtube YouSuck,"I love this style of games. Not many out there but this is among the best behind stick wars. There’s a lot of promise with this game which is why I’m writing a review. I’m still on timeline 1 battle 6 but I’ve played enough to give my two cents - and here they are  - being able to control where units move in the field would be nice. Like having ranger units hang back and defend while you build up resources  - an immovable ranged unit that sits on top of the HQ and acts as a defender when enemies get too close (upgradeable)   - make it to where a reasonable amount of green gems are awarded after successfully completing a battle the first time (Ex. B1-50, B2-75, ETC.) I don’t know if there’s daily quests or if the quests that were there were starting currency but it would be nice is all im sayin.  - there’s no point in trying to face a battle by using the same race because by the time you’ve upgraded enough to defeat them, you can just evolve and have to start all over anyways. That was a consistent experience to Battle 6. Incentivize the players to want to upgrade the evolution they’re on instead of just striving to reach the next one and start over again.  New troop ideas: Builder- builds fortifications relevant to their time period. Shield- an infantry unit that wields a shield to absorb more damage. The standard units are bullet sponges. Healer- heals your troops   Upgrade system is sub par. Two upgrade options with the amount of timelines presented just simply won’t do. Consider the improvements mentioned because there is upgrade improvement opportunity within."

2,StraightHonest,"Firstly the game is simple but fun. It’s truly an enjoyable game if strategy and advancing eras is something you are interested in. However, the reason I can’t give anything over a two star rating is due to aggravation that this game induces on the player. This comes from how you progress in the game, ads, and buying add-ons.  So far you progress through around 5 different stages of growth before reaching the end where you can decide to go to a different timeline. Basically starting over with different graphics and characters. At first, getting to the next stage of growth is simple. Either pay a large fee of in game coins or just beat the enemy structure and you are awarded the next generation. However on timeline 3 you no longer progress in the game just by beating the level. You have to have a special currency to continue progressing. To my knowledge there are only two ways to obtain this currency. Either you buy it with real world currency or you play the event and complete a challenge. If you thought the normal game play is challenging and time consuming then double it for the events.  I personally watch the ads, just due to the large amount of time you have to put into the game to process in the first 2 timeline. Even before you get to the ridiculous type on progression in timeline 3. But here are the issues with the ads. You have this incredibly small window to click the X to end the ads and get your reward. If you don’t click it perfectly it sends you to the App Store, once you leave the App Store you are back on the the same screen. In highly unlikely circumstance you do click the X many times it will bring up another screen that you have to click off of and the cycle continues. A majority of the ads I have seen are claiming that you can pay the game and earn money. Much of this seems to be a scam.  If you choose not to watch the annoying ads or buy things with real money. Prepare to spend hours of your time progressing through the stages. Only to hit a wall in timeline 3 because again just completing the level is not enough.  There are items in the game, these cards give incredibly small buffs to attack, health, ect to your units. This being said unless you put real money into the game you only get a small amount of ANOTHER special currency to obtain these. Or you can try your luck of spinning a wheel to obtain this currency in small amounts. You get on free spin, then you have to watch the annoying ads.  I’m going to play a bit more to see if things get better, though I have my doubts. For myself, ultimately I believe I’ll be deleting this game and never looking back."

5,Angelo7456,The game is.. not that bad.
1,Joelmonroy686,"In the vast sea of mobile gaming, ""We Are Warriors"" promised a thrilling conquest through strategic battles and heroic quests. However, what could have been a remarkable journey into the realms of strategy and action is overshadowed by an overwhelming barrage of advertisements that leave players more in combat with pop-ups than with in-game adversaries. Upon first glance, ""We Are Warriors"" captivates with its engaging graphics and the allure of leading an unstoppable army. The mechanics are intuitive, providing a seamless blend of strategy and action that could easily make for hours of entertainment. However, the game quickly reveals its true colors as a haven for endless ads, disrupting gameplay to the point where one might jest that the game should be aptly renamed ""We Are Ads."" Moreover, the game's design places an artificial cap on how much one can truly immerse in each battle. Developers have instituted a designated ending point for each skirmish, where the enemy forces cease to spawn, compelling players to advance and siege the enemy base. This mechanic seems intentionally crafted to prevent players from ""milking"" battles for coins, effectively gating progress and pushing towards either accepting the slow grind or succumbing to the temptation of in-app purchases for a smoother advancement. This design choice not only stifles the freedom and satisfaction that come from exploring different strategies over prolonged battles but also feels like a missed opportunity to reward skillful play and strategic thinking. Instead, it becomes clear that the game is engineered to nudge players towards frequent interactions with ads or the in-game store, overshadowing the potential for a purely skill-based progression. In conclusion, while ""We Are Warriors"" has the makings of a captivating game, its excessive reliance on advertisements and restrictive gameplay mechanics significantly detract from the overall experience. One can only hope that the developers will take heed of player feedback and adjust the balance between monetization and enjoyable gameplay. As it stands, players might find themselves battling against the tide of ads more than reveling in the triumphs of warfare. True warriors deserve a battleground not riddled with commercial breaks, but filled with unbridled strategy, skill, and the sweet taste of victory earned on the merit of their prowess alone."

2,Suaz14,"This game has the potential to be great. The idea is solid, the character designs are fun and the groundwork is there to build into a very enjoyable and rewarding player experience. That being said, the execution of the game needs some major adjustments.   The first thing that is very off putting with the game in its current state is the rate of progression. The rate at which your food supply increases is horribly slow. Each upgrade is genuinely a .02% upgrade. You have to use this upgrade at least 10 times before you receive enough to kill one more enemy before having to upgrade again. Which is frustrating because the amount of coins you gain (which are needed for upgrades) are based off the number of enemy units you’ve beat. And once you clear a level, you’re instantly rewarded with have the chance to fight the next evolution, where their weakest unit is on par health and strength as your strongest unit. And the slog starts all again. But the terrible progression rate is all okay though, because you can always watch some ads :)   My second big issue with this game, its obsession with ads. Tired with how long it’s taking to increase food production? You can use ads to gain more food at the start of a wave! Units not hitting strong enough? Watch a couple ads and increase your unit strength! Game speed a little too slow? Watch another ad! And the most egregious of all? The first task for today’s challenges was to watch five ads :)   The use of strategic inconvenience is way too high. It’s to the point where they admit if you don’t want to spend hours stuck in the same progression slog that they created, you can always watch some ads and progress that way. Great potential, horrible execution. I personally won’t play until these issues are addressed, and neither should you."

1,这是什么乱七八糟的名字,it all about ads
1,CRoman247,"This game has the potential to be great, with a core loop that is both fun and addictive. Unfortunately, the experience is ruined by the overwhelming presence of ads and micro transactions.  While it's technically possible to play without watching ads, doing so greatly diminishes the enjoyment, particularly in the early stages. Essential bonuses, like doubling rewards after tough levels, are locked behind ads. Additionally, the game progresses very slowly at the start, making daily ad boosts crucial. However, these boosts come with the worst kind of ads, which have progressively worsened over time. Initially, ads could be skipped after 10 seconds, but now they are forced 30-second ads or longer. Closing these ads is another frustration, as they don’t close automatically and instead bring up an additional splash screen with a tiny, hard-to-hit close button. Misclicks lead to the App Store, adding to the annoyance. Sometimes, there is even an extra timer before you can close the ad, making the experience even more frustrating.  Another major issue is the ubiquity and necessity of microtransactions. While not unplayable without spending money, the game becomes significantly less enjoyable. I am part of the problem here; I enjoyed the game enough to buy some upgrades to speed up gameplay and rewards. However, I've ended up spending far more than I intended, and I still get ads. I wish there were an option to remove ads entirely or to offer free daily upgrades without ads.  Developers, you have a gem of a game here, but your current practices may drive away long-term players. While you’ve successfully gotten me to spend money, it makes me hesitant to recommend this game to anyone else. For sustainable success, consider rethinking your approach to ads and microtransactions."

5,The tren,NO ADS!
5,Ooooooppppppennnnnn nowwww,Sooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooood.
5,"JULESER123456789,10",It has good and funny art.has a good challenge.
3,Corrupt Spoon,"fun game, but i recently bought the 2x coins and 500 credit bundle, and i happened to notice that by the next time i went to another timeline the prices of everything i need to buy to advance has adjusted to the 2x coins. almost like i never bought it. i am still at a point where i am stuck on a level and it takes 2-3 runs to get enough coins to even buy 1 upgrade. there is almost no chance that they don’t do something in the code to increase prices of upgrades once you evolve after buying a 2x or 3x coin bundle."
3,KingRese_kr,"The game was fun to play don’t get me wrong, the reason they gettin 3 stars tho is because I originally downloaded the game off an ad n it was nothing like it. False advertising shi is flaw n half the apps nowadays is jus clickbait"
1,罪乄,"by far the worst game I ever played. It advertises that the game doesn’t force ads on you, but you have to play the first level at least 30-50 times to pass it without watching ads. But when you do choose to watch ads(the only way to progress in the game without paying or grinding the same boring stages for hours) you have to watch 60-100 ads to pass a level(300-500 game play if you don’t watch ads), compare to other games that forces you to watch an ad every other level."
4,bolanola,"Why did you remove the speed multiplier, that made the game fun. Now players are a bit slower. Its take a little away from the game. Now i know its still available  for $11.99, which is far from it being free as long as you watched ads every so often."
4,mmmmsldjfhd,Tbh when they said are you stuck and they said use the cards or smth I can’t even figure how to use them.Honestly I think this game would be fun but I just can’t get through wave 1.Idk maybe I have some skill issue or smth.But yea the game looks good and it doesn’t fore adds on you too so that’s 4 because I just can’t progress.
2,Asylum222,It’s pretty easy to convince me to pay upwards of 60-100 dollars to permanently bypass ads on a mobile game. After doing so I almost always continue to purchase packs for as long as I play.  Bloated progression systems locked behind ads that I can’t even pay my fair way out of are unacceptable and an immediate uninstall for myself and many other paying customers.   I hope the ad revenue from screen addicted children is worth it. Company blacklisted.
2,jasiel88,Game shutsdown when i get ready to play redownloaded game and still crashing.pls fix

4,Kidder83,"It’s true the game is either very grindy or an ad farm in the beginning when your troops are 1:1 in strength.  Once you get them stronger than the timeline you’re in you’re good to go. Best plan in the first 5-10 timelines is to hop on each day and collect all of your green gems, and then stop playing for the day.  Thank you for getting rid of “watch ads” in the daily challenges. I would literally close the game the moment that came up. Watching an ad should be a choice, not forced, very happy y’all realized that.  My ONLY frustration now in the later game (timeline 18) is that my troops health modifier is around 30x, but their attack modifier is at 9x. The enemy troops are 12.8x attack/defense. This makes my troops very “tanky” but they do no damage. In ages where there are tanky AOE 3rd units this is valuable, but in ages where the 3rd unit is a single target ranged unit this is pretty annoying tbh.  I fully understand that this is just a simple, time wasting, mindlessly fun game, airplane game (it’s really not that serious). I really don’t mind watching ads from time to time. You’re doing a decent job at making the progression engaging to keep it interesting, but the RNG of these cards is killing me.  Can anything be done about the fact that I am constantly getting health cards and health modifiers at more than 2x the rate I can collect damage modifiers?… Possibly a weight modifier in the code that increases the chances of getting a damage card if you’re so far behind in damage like I am right now?"
2,VTBoarder2,"This game is really fun and has added small things to make it better. However, there have been quite a few barriers to making this better and many have been added by the developers. I’ve played this game a lot and gotten to timeline 278. Which has taken many many hours. Paying $19.99 originally for a 1.5 increase in speed was a joke but that slowly came down to $11. (Still a joke) now it’s no longer available. Used to be able to watch an add for a slight speed boost but those are gone too. I’ve almost completely finished the skill tree with all routes and I’m stuck waiting for a unit to slowly slide across the screen as I sit back and do nothing.. in the challenges with other players I’m in groups with pay to win people who have an insane amount more than I have so I can never win anything. This game just keeps getting worse as the mechanics start breaking down at high levels and it is incredibly slow…"
1,S55K3,"Got a high score and watched an ad to double the coin reward. Ad pauses if you use any other app (safari, spotify, etc) and when the ad is done, the game just crashes and deletes any progress. Absolutely aggregious waste of time."
1,HotSauce305,THIS IS A GODDAMN COPY OF AGE OF WAR
5,Karen not a,It’s good.buuuuuuuuut I just wanna say battle one of timeline 5 swamp age is rigged
2,choco milk12345,This is like impossible The more progress you make the harder if you dont watch ads then you can’t do anything!!! Also they literally spawn 5 per second AND we spawn 1 per like 9 seconds ! Like HOW?! It will probably take 9999 hours to beat the game . Make it easier its hard af😭!! Its a ad watching simulator!!!If if it’s easier then i will leave a higher rating. Update:i just realized that the other team has 500 hp and the players has 2😢AND… when i spent 99% of my coins on base hp and it gave 1! THIS IS SO UNFAIR 😭😭😭 Like WHAT!?one of the top reviews was RIGHT! Btw no ads=you are stuck at lv 1 .ads= slow gameplay = 99999 hours     Normally games give you weaker or same level enemies so its not impossible this game throws EVERYTHING at you Whyyy just WHYYY
1,Pardhu vic,I was in first place in an event and after the update event is gone and my 10000 green coins are gone give that 10000 greens back and events back
1,Camping Cloud,"I’m on timeline 45 been playing for a long time but it just hit a point where things stopped being refreshed, the keys for dungeons and boss fights, I haven’t got the option to watch a ad or even just get the daily amount of attempts at either of them for 3+ days, its pretttty crazy"
3,wrenhxven,i really wanted to enjoy this game. all ads are optional and fair. cute format. i dig it. but it keeps telling me that if i am stuck to do daily challenges and a zombie format thing but i never got daily challenges past the first day and ive never seen anything for the zombie game? i have iphone so idk if it works on android better or what but my game broke and its frustrating that i cant do the daily challenges and unlock powerups so im stuck at a lower attack and health than i should be with daily challenge rewards
5,No nickname43,This game is actually like the ads and that makes me really happy.And I love how hard it can be!
5,Messi30jr,Best game ever  Of revolution ever in the woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrlllllddddd
5,P@93r,This is a great game for your little ones.It teaches never give up.
5,Lilmontro,☺️😗🤓😏😙😜😜
5,bbtvtgtgt,This was just like the adds but even better 10/10 5 stars
1,HKHTKH,Interesting game concept that was ruined by the greed of the team. Designed to be incredibly slow for ad revenue farming. If you pay a whopping $11.00 it speeds up by 50% but is still incredibly slow and still forces you to watch ads to progress at a reasonable rate. Just sad.
4,AloonyToonyHehe,I think that the graphics are adorable and the animation is wonderful but battle one is insanely difficult. It took me a week to get past battle one because it was THAT DIFFICULT. I was on the verge of deleting it or watching a YouTube video.
5,james jackass,This game is amazing I downloaded this a day ago and im already at 50M coins.this game is so much fun I can’t even explain it
5,K_dogcat,This game is so fun.this game is is so easy you like can’t range.
5,JROOOOOoOoO00,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!
2,hippywhites,I agree with the person comment the normal progression is hard and the AI is like way to good and has better troops always even after I grinded my butt off to get to the next era and why does everything cost so much to upgrade troops and eras? I don’t make enough unless I watch ad after ad super lame please do better alway more troops in each ear would be more fun in my opinion
4,evhgjvud,What’s the point of the cards.   It’s states I have 103.52 atk damage and 69.58 health.  Which a doesn’t seem to mean anything because when the same type of troops atk each other. They are both knocked out.    Which tells me the cards are useless
3,Pr0Br0Pr0,"I am not saying We Are Warriors is the worst game in the world it’s just it needs a few improvements. The first problem is at the beginning of the game. The first battle feels like it’s the most challenging part of the game. The Stone Age base (enemy side) has 500 heath. Meanwhile, the Stone Age base (players side) has 6 heath. And there’s so. Much. Ads. Like every time I try to end the battle there’s a ad. There’s an ad at every corner. It’s kinda like there’s an ad in every nook and cranny. So if you are the developer and you read this, please listen. I hope you can make these changes. (Ps if your reading this please send this emoji. 😜)"
4,Provvooked,"When they get trapped in their door it’s the most annoying thing possible, you can’t kill the people. You will lose all your troops attacking when they get trapped in the door.thats the most annoying thing about the game."
1,Qteep69,Just play age of war. It’s the same game but you don’t have to watch 50000 ads to play at a somewhat decent speed. You can choose to not watch ads… just be prepared to restart hundreds/thousands of times.
1,Me 555,"If you like ads Ads Also ads And ads Oh and ads Did I mention ads Long ads No short ads Ads Ads Ads And ads Also ads And more ads Ads Ads and ads There’s ads A lot of ads And ads Ad simulator But also ads Oh and ads Also ads And there’s ads oh and ads almost forgot ads also there’s ads and also ads.

Wait ads. Dang it ads. More ads. Shoot. Ads. Game? No ads. Also ads. I’ve watched a lot of ads. Is this a game or just ads. No it’s just ads. Ads. Ads. I know this seems like it going on forever but also, I’d like to ad there’s a lot of ads. And there is ads. Also there is ads. And sometimes I get ads. And ads. And ads. Also ads. And also ads. I think there is also ads. Also there is ads. And wait, you guessed it ads. Oh yeah and ads. Did I mention ads. Yeah ads. Add and ad to the list of ads. Also multiple the number of ads. That is not even close to how many ads you’ll watch. Also there is ads. Yes ads. But wait yes there is more ads. Ads that are really unintelligent. Yes oh glorious ads. But wait did I mention ads. There sure is a lot of wait for it….. ads. Yes oh so many ads. I hope they make money off all the ads. I could likely be a millionaire based of how many ads I’ve watched. Also there is a few ads. I’ve watched a lot of ads. Might have watched too many. Might have seen too much. So many ads. But also there is a lot of ads. Sometimes I think ads. Then other times I just think ads. Will there ever be no ads. No there is just ads. Bad ads. Worse ads. Even worse ads. They’re all bad ads. No good ads. Just ads. The amount of times I’ve said ads doesn’t even scratch the barrel of how many ads I’ve seen. Also there is a lot of ads. One last really honest thing that I’m not sure people Know, there is a lot of ads in this game and also there’s a lot of ads. And also I’m thinking I should delete because there is too many ads. But before you find out, please watch this ad but also you have no choice because ads. Goodbye.   Signed ads  And also ads Oh and ads Also ads And ads Last one, ads  Just kidding there is also ads  Thank you  Ads  Ads Ads And ads Ads Also ads Ads ads Ads"

5,StankyDanky00,"It’s the year 2011 , your next to a computer , search Y8.com or Coolmath games , find the game - “Age of War”. This is that MOBILE GAME"
2,Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1536,"I’ve played this game for 3hrs straight and I’ve progressed very little. I chose to not watch any ads for anything just to see how far I could get. This game is the definition of insanity. I have 0.64/s food production, 10 base health, and unlocked all three units but I can’t really get any further in the level because the ai advances too quickly. I make roughly 100-150 gold per game and I’m at the point where I have to play three games for my next production upgrade of +0.02/s!! The only reason I’ve kept playing is because 1. I have some patience for slow games and 2. I made it a challenge to see how far I could get without watching any ads. I might see if it gets any better if I do watch them but I doubt it."
5,thatonwkidinclass,It's so addictive and I'm on it 24/7 365
5,21 meme is kinda dieing,This game isn’t exactly like the ads that you see on TikTok or YouTube but all the ads are optional and it can be a good way to kill time

2,Jykellywe,It’s a rip off of an old addictinggames.com game but less fun. You can’t win unless you watch 100 ads and even then it will take hours. Rather than make something new they ripped off a good idea but made it less fun. This game only exists to advertise to the player.
2,wndndndhdnbdbdbddhdhev,You have 1 HP they have 500 HP like how is that fair.But it is a good game but the person that made the game need to get sewed because they are not making the game fair.
4,yoter mcgoter,Honestly I’d pay for it if it was like .99 or 1.99. 9.99 is egregious. Other than that pretty fun game 👍🏽
1,JisawHdFan,At the the start the other team 500 base health and you only have 1 base health so that part is rigged and the health of the other teams players on farm age is higher than your players health.the only good part abt this game is that you can buy better upgrades like base health and how much food you produce and that you can buy like Dino’s and throwers that’s basically it. So most of the game is rigged.thats it
4,Anthony Rio (him),Very good potential buuut once you level up your stage it is waaay to hard to Kill them and you have to grind so I think you should make it easier.Overall fun!
5,finding glitches,"First of all WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS GAME THERE IS NO REASON. Even though it takes a lot of time to complete a level, it’s good. I like levels that take patience and time. For the ad problem, DONT WATCH ANY ADS (except the pop up ones but it takes 5 seconds to skip them). For the money problem, WHAT ARE YOU, SOMEONE WHO LIKES CARDS!?  Overall, it’s a great game. 100/100."
1,Envy972,Kdjdjskaodjdbskal
1,gbtcmvmvk,I saw this game from a YouTube ad. I was interested in the game and I absolutely didn't like it. This game is ridiculously hard for every new player. I hate the fact that your base has ONLY FIVE HEALTH and the other base has FIVE HUNDRED. that's ridiculously hard to pass for new people. It Takes so long to even realize the fact that that your food production has got faster when you upgrade it. Why does the other base do better at the start that the player. PLEASE FIX IT
1,Noah pope,They are broken and it’s pissing me off
4,Top hat king 69,"Amazing game but feels like it’s always missing a speed up button.in my opinion it’s a good game just is pretty slow. I would personally give it 5 stars if the game had a speed up button for the fights.I know people usually look at the reviews to see if it’s a good game, this is an amazing game a bit slow but you should absolutely play it and check it out.but if it’s not your cup of tea that’s just at least try it out first it’s really fun… but a bit slow they really need to add a speed up button"
3,cjenningsidlegend,"I was waiting for a new update then it finally came. They added new Heroes and hero missions. The problem is, heroes cost the blue currency, and with the update, they removed the ability to buy this currency with gems. I bought gems before I figured out you couldn’t exchange them. And the only way to earn the blue currency is to evolve. I’m on timeline 53, so evolving takes a long time. It’s going to take me weeks before I can get a new hero, I can’t invest into skills anymore because they also cost the blue currency… the missions seem good, but I can’t access them because I have a “zero percent success rate.” I’m on timeline 53, so how much longer until I get enough power to do them? And lastly, they nerfed the rewards for the race. You used to get 10000 gems for winning, but now it’s only 500. If you revert/fix those changes, I would reinstall the game."

3,ThisAppUsedToBeSomething,What the actual crap is the tutorial in this for? “Oh here’s your 2hp base and here’s this 500hp enemy base.” And then they send out the beefiest cakes coming out of the Moscow bakeries since Rasputin himself. Like I still want to play the game but is that the repetition of this game? Am I going to have to sit through a bunch of this just to play the game way better than you can try to teach me? Yoda could barely teach me.
2,BARAAshot,"Features: the game is just clicking a button and upgrading. Every play has the same chances of losing/winning. There needs to be some skill that differentiates me from another player.  Bug: i have 35 coins but 35 coin upgrade is unlocked. Make sure code isnt ‘if upgrade > money.   Other than that, keep it up. I hope to see more to the game."
