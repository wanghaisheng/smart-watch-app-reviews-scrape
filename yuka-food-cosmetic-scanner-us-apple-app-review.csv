5,Cassidy üò±üòÇüòã,"I have to say i really enjoy this app. I'm a licensed cosmetologist/esthetician and of course like to be mindful of the products that I'm using on my self but not only that but also on my clients. This app makes it so easy to break down whats in a product so easily. ive shown everyone i know and even paid for the premium version. (this app is consumer funded. company's do not pay them to say their product is this or that) me being superstitious compared what the app said to what the label of ingredients said and its always right.  i know the app is still fairly new and the interface and features it offers outside of just listing ingredients and letting you know if there bad then offering recommendations it doesn't do a whole lot more. I like that it keeps of history of barcode scans, i wish it had a feature to incorporate online shopping. Me personally i dont shop alot in stores and without a physical barcode it makes buying things online still risky. so that could be a cool feature. As well as creating like brands and like ranking them by a collective of what their product scores are. I love this idea of putting the power back in the consumers hands though. knowledge is power, and it starts with our daily habits to really see change. THANK YOU!"
4,maligatormomtx,"I think everyone should have this app. It makes it so much easier to read between the lines of all ingredients. Especially beauty products. I am a scientist and half the time I don‚Äôt even know what some of these ingredients are. When it comes to food, I think it is very eye opening to see that just because something is labeled as organic, non gmo, blah, blah‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt always have the best ingredients. Now to my complain. I don‚Äôt buy anything with corn syrup or added sugars. This i already know by heart after going for clean only foods about 10 years ago. However, for someone who is just starting to navigate this confusing world of food, it may be misleading to read that ice cream is rated as poor. Now, hear me out. This was my husband‚Äôs thinking when we scanned an ice cream brand at Sprouts. The rating was poor. It said it had high fat and high sugar. According to my husband, ice cream should be fatty and sugary. Can‚Äôt argue with that if we are talking about a standard ice cream recipe. In his eyes, there was nothing wrong with the ice cream. The app fails to indicate that the brand contains corn syrup. I think it should be broken down better. The rating is poor because it has high sugar content, but not just any sugar. It has corn syrup. I feel the developers should work more into explaining why a high sugar rating deems a product poor. Not everyone is well versed with the dangers of sugars, real or fake."
3,Keila310,"They need to put more helpful recommendations and alternatives. It‚Äôs very stressful using this app because everything you scan is toxic but they don‚Äôt offer enough alternatives for people. They only offer a few and if you cannot locate these brands you‚Äôre basically stuck. It would be a lot more encouraging if they gave you many other options to choose from some people have allergies and sensitivities to certain ingredients so the first few products you recommend might not work for them but I do think that an app like this should try to dig a little bit deeper. I pay for premium and feel like it‚Äôs not that special. On the other hand I love using this app because it breaks down all of the ingredients which ones are good and which ones are bad, etc. However there are items that I‚Äôve scanned before that have come up as excellent that later on were changed to being poor products and having bad ingredients. The ingredients on the products did not change so I am wondering why the scoring changed it‚Äôs very confusing . I t makes me feel like I‚Äôm wasting my money every time I buy something that says it‚Äôs clean or excellent on Yuka I will scan it a couple months later and it‚Äôs now considered harmful? I don‚Äôt get it. There are some products that have remained clean and I‚Äôm happy about that because that means I won‚Äôt have to be replacing them and spending more money to buy new ones."
5,Rachhxhxusbshd,"As a pregnant mom this has saved me soo much time and is just the most wonderful app I have! I love it so much. My husbands aunt suggested it to me and I have used it since. I just have a couple suggestions that would make it easier to use and would make me love it even more!   First, I would suggest a filter option when you search for results on the app, if possible it would be amazing to have a ‚Äúfilter from highest rated to lowest rated‚Äù option so I don‚Äôt have to spend an hour clicking into every result to check the rating. Because they aren‚Äôt in order right now.  Also I would suggest doing something like my fitness pal has and allowing customers to also input the information of products that haven‚Äôt been reviewed by your team yet. I‚Äôm not saying to post them right away but possibly allow that and they could go through a process where someone checks it for mistakes or formula changes before it gets posted. I was thinking it might even save your team some time but who knows it could make it too complicated . Just a thought.  Either way that result filter option would be so amazing to have. No matter what I love this app so much and have been telling everyone about it!! 10/10!!"
4,Protect speech,"Needs to provide healthier alternative product s. Example Heavy whipping cream that I am using show that it has additives that are unhealthy. It shows not alternative. I found a site that listed 10 companies that offer organic heavy whipping cream without additives. Trader Joe‚Äôs, 365 by Whole Foods Market, Natural by Nature Organic Cream plus many regional producers. Maybe you can get the users to help search for better alternatives. Give them an Incentive if they offer a better alternative and you list it give them 3 extra month of free membership. Also sugar is one of the most addictive ingredients being used causing cardiovascular disease and diabetes and should be avoided or limited to a maximum of 24 g of total carbs intake per day. The government food chart is flawed by to many special interest groups trying to keep the population unhealthy. Obesity is proof of that. If you want to have a successful App. You have to make it helpful in finding the healthy alternatives products and I think your members if you get them involved will make it happen. If you don‚Äôt someone else will lead the way. (Bobby approved is a new app that does that) People are searching for trusted information. They have lost confidence in the FDA and other governmental health agencies . This a golden opportunity to fill that void. Good luck."
5,BeamishBeth,"Some apps are fun, many are useful, and a very few are life-changing. Yuka is one of the latter. I initially used it to scan my previously purchased foods and hygiene/cosmetic products, and now I use it every time I shop. I even became a Premium member in order to look up products I can‚Äôt scan (like when I‚Äôm shopping online). I have very sensitive skin and have often dealt with contact dermatitis, burning, itching, and other adverse reactions. Being able to find and switch to products that don‚Äôt contain potential allergens or harmful chemicals has given me peace of mind and much happier skin. I also like to eat as cleanly as I can, and Yuka facilitates that. It‚Äôs a lot easier to simply not buy a food at the store when it‚Äôs rated poor or bad, and, if I decide to buy it anyway, it‚Äôs a no-brainer to eat it sparingly. It‚Äôs amazing and disheartening how many processed foods that claim to be super healthy actually aren‚Äôt healthy at all. Needless to say, Yuka has saved me from being deceived and wasting money. In a world full of vendors whose bottom line is financial gain rather than creating and selling safe, effective products, Yuka is an enormous blessing. Thank you, Yuka developers, for putting people‚Äôs health above profit!"
5,SavyBussinessWoman,"Ok so I just downloaded this app, and fell in love with it. A very close relative of mine has been trying to eat healthy for the past year or so now and feels like nothing was working. I showed her this app, and that many products she thought were healthy were actually contributing to gaining weight, migranes, and even more conditions. She was ecstatic about this app, and next time she goes to the store this app will be with her.  I  personally love how you get recommendations on similar products that are healthier alternatives. Not only that but I feel much better knowing that what I am going to eat In the future is healthy, and tasty.   Some ideas I have for this app are ones that will make it easier to purchase items, for example‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say a cereal brand you have been buying products from is not healthy, and you tap on a similar, but healthier alternative, it would make it very convenient if you could tap it and add it to a personalized in app grocery list, for when you go to the store. That way you have a picture of this unfamiliar product along with the name of it. I am very excited to use this app, and hope it will make my future healthier! Thanks a million!"
5,mauimikal311,"I have since replaced my deodorant, toothpaste body wash using this. I only buy products it says that are good AT THE LEAST!!! It‚Äôs an independent app. There‚Äôs no outside push by corporations. It seems and is like the best app ever made because it‚Äôs saving us from harmful chemicals, like parabens, sulfates, artificial sweeteners, texturizers, food dyes and soooo much more that is harmful to ingest. When I shop at the local wholefoods, I find MANY products within that store harmful and not everything is perfectly clean there to buy. I share it with people in the store as I‚Äôm shopping and with the cashiers. It blows their mind! But then, I see them go straight to their phone and look for it to get it. I usually show people how it works on the spot. These are just strangers and I am telling everybody about it. When I‚Äôm at work, and people are eating microwave foods, and what not, scanning those products is all bad and hazardous to eat. Finding typical products that seem to be good for you, actually most name brand products are hazardous for you!  I hope everybody gets this app and this doesn‚Äôt get shut down. It‚Äôs truly a blessing that this exists.üôåüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüôåüèΩ I‚Äôm so thankful! üí™üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ôüèΩ"
5,goodtouse1,"I love this app so much. User friendly & affordable. 10/10 recommend. Do you know how much excessive phosphate consumption I‚Äôve avoided thanks to Yuka app?? A ton. Shocking to see how many food brands are horrible for your health. I live in a town where cancer is rampant and it seems so many people are dying from it. Just from food scanning through this app alone, I can see why. Cannot thank the people who made Yuka enough.  One thing I can add as constructive criticism is the calorie intake part could be excluded. Not saying don‚Äôt include the macronutrients of how much something has, but It would be better if the ranking focused solely on hazardous ingredients. For example, It will give an item an undeserved poor rating because it is considered ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù but other than that have clean ingredients üòÖ everyone has different weight/calorie goals. We can come to our own conclusion on wether or not something has too many calories based on our life style. So for those who feel guilty for seeing the ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù label don‚Äôt feel so bad. Track your own calories and you decide if having a snack is good enough to be included into your day."
5,Palmer Evans,"While I don‚Äôt agree with absolutely everything said in the app (I mean, who 100% agrees with anyone one everything), I absolutely love that they CITE THEIR SOURCES! Most articles I find don‚Äôt source information or source possibly 2 other studies/articles, but 90% of the original articleis just  personal opinion or experience. Sometimes, items will say they contain harmful materials, but READ THE DESCRIPTION! I have found, with my own scans, sometimes the harmful ingredient is only harmful in certain situations, and the product I scanned DOES NOT fall in that category. So the descriptions of these ingredients is, in a sense, a copy/paste, but not in a bad way. This actually means they research and review ingredients, not products. Also, as a personal side note, it is NOT an American website/app, which gives it more credibility, to me. I can‚Äôt trust these processed-loving Americans‚Ä¶.  If the developers are reading this, I would hope that descriptions for healthy/well-rated ingredients will be introduced as well. I know that comes with more liability, but knowing what GOOD is contained is just as important as knowing what BAD is contained. I think so, at least."
5,E.Iyah,"In eating plant based foods and fish, I thought I was doing pretty decent. Until I got this app. Yuka is a life saver!! I‚Äôve been scanning everything in my house and I‚Äôm shocked! You cannot trust these companies to do right by you. I‚Äôve been throwing stuff away left and right!! I had just gotten a heath scan and my gastrointestinal system is severely off balanced. No wonder!! A family member suggested Yuka the same day. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for this app. It was right on time.  What I love about this app is it tells you why foods are bad and what harmful ingredients do to your body. That is overly appreciated! It also gives you recommendations for better products! I can only imagine the time it took to put all of this together. This here is your best defense against big name companies who care more about a dollar than your health. We are exposed to toxins more than ever now. I was so paranoid about buying food and Yuka has eased a lot of those fears and will assist me in getting my gut health back balanced! It‚Äôs definitely worth buying the app and for all the goodies, it‚Äôs super inexpensive.  Thank you for putting this together! The greatest app yet!!"
5,randydial,"I wish I could say something short and simple where you would try this app. Maybe you‚Äôre like me and try to eat healthy but not entirely sure of what you‚Äôre putting into your body. Maybe like me you‚Äôve tried some food nutrition apps but find them to be confusing or just out to spam you. Maybe you too think that because the packaging looks healthy, the food is healthy. NOT SO!!  I have learned a lot about that from Yuka. This app has really improved my life.     Even though I could use it for free, I am so grateful that I donated to them anyway. I want this app to be around for my kids and grandkids so that they can have a better life.    I try to tell everyone about Yuka and even demonstrate it to random people in the grocery store. The app and its developers are giving millions of people, tons of easy to understand food data and a chance to really improve quality of life FOR FREE. The app is very fast, easy to use, works just like they describe, and it helps with food choices.    Honestly, you won‚Äôt regret getting it but your body will regret if you don‚Äôt use it."
5,Readthebibleandspreadtheword,"This app is genuinely just mind blowing. You can scan infinite items without paying! There is a flaw though, they don‚Äôt rate anything with high protein and sometimes they don‚Äôt have the item I am scanning. Those are most definitely the only cons. One of my favorite things with this app is to search something up you do have to pay but you can choose!? I‚Äôve never seen that within my whole life, you can choose 10, 15, or 20 dollars. And did i mention the subscription is yearly? That is the biggest steal I have seen in a subscription. There is one feature I hope will be in a future update, And that is where you can scan meals or anything within that matter and it will tell how how caloric it is and if it is healthy or anything like that. I know that is a lot to ask for because this app is meant to tell you if something is healthy or not and if it has anything that is potentially harmful to you, though it does tell you how caloric an item is. If the developers add the feature I mentioned I would pay any price for a subscription to this."
5,HockeyMom1227,"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about Yuka. As someone who values finding the healthiest, organic products in the supermarket, there is none better. Esp as I follow a Whole Foods plant based diet . First, I‚Äôm stunned at how I have never scanned anything and it wasn‚Äôt recognized. Also, I appreciate that they take ZERO money from brands to ensure they can stay objective and unbiased. The other food apps I used before I found YUKA I discovered were sponsored by brands which is not good. I value that when j scan something and it is not recommended I can instantly see similar products that are recommended. This feature makes it so much easier for swap out food choices. I‚Äôve also completely eliminate some foods that I used to use that are not good and found there are not better options anyway so I don‚Äôt use at all anymore. If you want to get help understanding labels and seeing what is good or not and why, you‚Äôll love this app. I literally walk around the store with my Yuka app on the entire time ! Lastly , it remember your scans so you can look back and refer if needed. The best!"
5,Jahsheli,"I was blessed to run into a woman at my local Costco. She must have seen me laboring over the exhausting ingredient labels of the variety of items packed into my shopping cart. Due to the very concerning preservatives and additives as well as other unhealthy ingredients being added to the many foods families eat daily I have become diligent (even my 12 year old daughter is the same - We LOVE and appreciate this app so much!).  So the woman shares the app and how much she loves it and for the same reasons (very thorough, huge time saver, etc) and shares how easy it is and took it immediately into action scanning am item loaded with additives and some Risky ones too so I immediately put that one back but since I‚Äôve had the app I‚Äôve become more educated and also saddened by what‚Äôs being allowed by the FDA, I‚Äôm so concerned. But huge thank you to Yuka Website and the app developers. Please keep doing what you do and ALWAYS no matter what keep your integrity üôèüòä‚ô•Ô∏è I ended up doing the pro version for 1 year to support this wonderful work you‚Äôre doing. Thank you again!"
5,Rock n Pop,I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with this app. I‚Äôve had it for a couple weeks now and have managed to scan all of the foods i usually eat. It so scary how many common household foods have dangerous additives. Lots of food in the USA is banned in other countries cause of how dangerous it is. At first it felt a little discouraging when everything I scanned got a bad rating. But the recommendations helped me realize that there are a lot of healthy none expensive alternatives that taste just as great if not better. I‚Äôve convinced my whole family to download the app so they can see what they are putting in their bodies. It‚Äôs crazy how even products that are marketed as healthy have a ridiculous amount of hazardous additives. It is SO important the we understand what we are putting in our bodies. We all want to live long healthy lives and this app definitely helps. This app makes it so easy to know and understand what the ingredients mean and how they effect our bodies. I‚Äôm so grateful to have found this app. Thank you YUKA for caring about our health!!!
1,JordynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnJay,"This app is the worst, it will make you feel guilty for eating almost anything & the reason why makes absolutely no sense. In my opinion, it promotes eating disorders by the caloric content rating. A snack is meant to be 300 calories or less, but according to this, a 180 calorie protein bar is ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù so they suggested a different kind, the other kind had half the amount of protein and 190 calories. How are you going to rate a food ‚Äúbad‚Äù for having ‚Äútoo many calories‚Äù and then suggest an alternative that has even more calories and less health benefits. Also, a 180 calorie protein bar with 21 grams of protein is not ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù. Also a lot of their sources on additives are not science backed like they claim, they claim a number of things are linked to cancer when they aren‚Äôt. They will promote some products as ‚Äúgood‚Äù when they‚Äôre in fact not, and then demonize others so that they can provide a suggestion. Highly suspicious that this is due to them being paid by those suggested companies, as they‚Äôre most of the time either equally as healthy or even worse. Please don‚Äôt download this app, the fact that they claim it‚Äôs science backed is a complete lie. If you find yourself using this app before buying food, look up the term orthorexia, because this is a sure fire way to get it."
1,tiapink13,"First the good: the app is fast, scans quickly, user friendly, and Tracks what you‚Äôve scanned. It also talks about questionable chemicals   The Problems:  the biggest problem is that it does not focus on ingredients, only the nutrition label. Does not even give you a picture or a list if the ingredients, not even for the alternative recommendations. Friends, Ingredients Matter!  Ingredients are the first thing we should know about the food, before the calories, grams of sugar, amount of protein and fats. You can‚Äôt just read the amount of protein on a product label and know what you‚Äôre putting in your body. Not all ingredients are created the same, so the type of sugar matters, the type of fats matter, the quality of these ingredients matter, and how the body processes and uses the nutrients.  This app will point out that there is too much sugar in a item, then go on to recommend a food with artificial sugar, which is so incredibly damaging to your health.  It will recommend food with highly processed/refined oils, and foods high in glyphosate (which you can‚Äôt even read on an ingredient list) you just have to know what foods are heavily sprayed with chemicals, which is why people need good advice from apps like this, not more bad choices to replace the already bad choices."
5,Nickelbag14,"This app should automatically come with new phones. Where was this all my life!?! I‚Äôm a scanning queen now and my eyes are being opened to so much. I eat whole non processed foods 90% of the time, so the stuff that is processed and I assumed was the best version, I‚Äôm finding out is not. I love it shows what additives and how risky they are, I love how fast and easy it is, I love that you can add things that might not be listed, I love that it‚Äôs not just for food!!! I scanned 5 different deodorants I have and the one I spent $25 on was the worst!!! The cleanest was from TJmax for 4.99!  I absolutely love this app and have been a spokesperson for it since day 1!!! I have turned so many people onto this app and the countless messages I receive when I share results I get make me feel great! To be able to help someone make better decisions that can possibly help avoid disease or sickness means the world to me. So if all I can do is share about this app then that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do!  Thank you you amazing souls for creating this App!"
4,nicbb777,"I really like this app! Especially for beauty and body products. However, I don‚Äôt love how some foods are rated ‚Äúbad‚Äù just because they are caloric, fatty, or sugary. Most foods can be part of a healthy and well rounded diet, even if they are fatty or sugary. It‚Äôs ok to have a treat sometimes as long as it‚Äôs not your main source of sustenance. Instead of learning Yuma‚Äôs value judgement on the item, I just want to check to make sure there are no additives and chemicals in these products. It told me that an organic dark chocolate bar that had 4 simple ingredients, 3 of which were organic besides the salt, was bad and recommended a non-organic dark chocolate bar with far more ingredients that I couldn‚Äôt even pronounce or recognize. I‚Äôm sorry but in this case, the more wholesome and organic product is going to win out. Sometimes you just want some dark chocolate, and I don‚Äôt need Yuka telling me that it‚Äôs bad! I just want it to tell me that the ingredients are healthy and that there are no additives or hazardous materials in it. It also seems like it could be triggering for those dealing with eating disorders or orthorexia."
5,Sanja Evatsug,"Yuka makes it so much easier for me to shop for healthy food. The grading system over 100 and the simplified rationale behind the assigned grade makes it easy to understand. Also, the grades classify the products into for categories (excellent, good, poor or bad) simplifying my decision making process to purchase a product or not.  The most appreciated feature is the suggestion of better similar products that Yuka makes in the event the product scanned would not be a good choice. I must mention that I appreciate the highlight of hazardous additives. Most of us know very little to noting about the numerous chemicals that we‚Äôre being bombarded with by the food industry. Thank you Yuka for calling out loud these harmful substances and educating the user about their eventual effects on our health.  I have been telling everyone about Yuka and so far all my friends and family have downloaded this app and have been so excited to tell me about their findings of better food options."
3,Rake28488292,"Basically the app makes a lot of assumptions about nutrition that I, and research of the science of nutrition, don‚Äôt agree with. For example, the app will give butter (which recent studies and human consumption for thousands of years have proven it lowers the risk of heart disease and obesity) a low score because of saturated fats and then gives something with seed oils, rampant with oxidized omega 6 which is the fat that clogs your arteries, a higher score. The app also assumes that for example, salt is bad for you. As a ranch hand for a while I understand how dumb of a statement that is. Because if you don‚Äôt provide salt blocks to cows they start licking dirt in a desperate attempt to find salt and then die. Salt is a necessary nutrient. Period. Because of all of this, I use the app purely for looking into additives and chemicals, and not for nutritional advice, which an app like this should focus on anyway, because different people need different nutrients, and lots of people are turning to different lifestyle diets to accomplish their goals which according to this app are very unhealthy. (For example I exclusively eat beef, butter, dairy, broccoli, and Diet Pepsi üòÇ)"
5,YouMustBeADrag,"This app to me is very trustworthy considering how it gives studies (multiple studies) on what additives and preservatives are in our beauty and food products. Truly opened my eyes in what food is or isn‚Äôt good for us and poses health risks. Also realizing foods that promote ‚Äúhealthy for you‚Äù labels are actually one of the most terrible for you. I recommend this app for people that are also pretty active to count your calories per serving for free per, to know the intake of protein for serving for free, and to check all the nutrients per servings for free, they give really accurate information and measurements. My experience with this app is changing my hair products from Mielle to OGX coconut oil and Maui Hair mask, this naturally made my hair soft, longer, shinier, and very voluminous, thanks with the app I have stayed away from the harmful hair products media likes to promote like Carol‚Äôs Daughter, Camille Rose, and all those known products. In conclusion of this review comment I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS APP. To YUKA, THANKS FOR LITERALLY HELPING US‚ù§Ô∏è GOD BLESS THESE CREATORSüôè"
3,whydonineedtotypeanythinghere,"This app has a great design and is easy to use. I love scanning things around the grocery store or around my bathroom, but I find several things very annoying. There are often duplicates of the same exact product and many duplicates that have wildly different ratings - each with different lists of ingredients. One is rated Poor and another Excellent. How is that helpful? I find that the ‚Äúingredients scanner‚Äù camera feature is horribly inaccurate and doesn‚Äôt always pick up/ include what‚Äôs really listed (Ingredients can easily be found by searching for the product listed online, how is this not integrated to fix the discrepancies?). Duplicates don‚Äôt get flagged and corrected unless you complain - Why isn‚Äôt this more automated or at least consistently looked out for? Certain ingredients like Talc and Fragrance (Parfum) are listed as healthy when they are known to have caveats and potentially cause harm. Because of it‚Äôs flaws I can‚Äôt trust much of what this app tells me which is such a headache. PLEASE consider finding smarter technology or finding a way to hire more people to keep everything accurate."
5,cecegirl_1122,"I really enjoy utilizing this app when i‚Äôm at the grocery store and picking out the best option for myself. This app is very helpful in telling you why they rate an item negatively and positively and it‚Äôs so simple and straight to the point that I can use that rating to my own discretion. Whether I say no all together on that specific item and look through the app‚Äôs recommendations of a similar more positively rated item or want to read through and accept that ‚Äúyeah maybe it is too sweet but oh well, as long as there aren‚Äôt any seed oils and additives‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll accept it,‚Äù it depends on my mood or the item i‚Äôm looking at entirely. I really appreciate this app and how simple and easy it is to use and choose where it matters most. I also love that there is a scanned history for all the old items you‚Äôve scanned before that you can refer back too! I really am enjoying this app, excited for any beneficial updates. I haven‚Äôt used the app for that long yet for any suggestions at the moment."
5,Mocha Coffey,"I have had this app for about 6 months now and I love it. I use it to scan all beauty products and foods. I can‚Äôt believe I have found so many bad products that I have used for so many years!!!! Terrible!! I suffer from migraines and some other health issues and I believe this app will help me recognize some bad and dangerous ingredients that can negatively affect the kidneys, hormones, fertility and cardiovascular disease. My fianc√© thought I was crazy to start using better products because they are more expensive even though they don‚Äôt have all the bad ingredients that disrupt your body, but he had me scan his products he uses and he immediately threw them all out when I showed him. I even scanned most of Sephora‚Äôs ‚Äúclean beauty‚Äù products and I was so surprised to find that most if not all of their clean beauty products are poor or very bad for you. CRAZY!!!!   Thank you for creating this amazing app at such a fair price!!!! It‚Äôs literally the best!!!!!"
1,~-soph-~,"This app isn‚Äôt accurate, I saw it from TikTok. Yes it gives you information about the product but it has nothing to do with its use and how you use it and doesn‚Äôt give tips or information about what happens when you use a certain amount and where. I‚Äôm related to 7 people in the medical field and I am learning about this same topic in school. I have dermatologist recommended products and if I scan them it says a very low rating, I asked my doctor about a dermatologist recommended face wash I had that was apparently 0/100 and he explained how the app was explaining what could happen if you consume it and had nothing to do with the use of the actual product. Out of curiosity I went home and scanned some candy and it literally said ‚Äútoo sweet‚Äù with the red dot, of course it‚Äôs super sweet- it‚Äôs candy! The app doesn‚Äôt explain how much of consuming the candy or food can cause said issues. For beauty products it just explains the worst possible thing that could happen which is not likely to actually occur as long as you‚Äôre using the product correctly. I recommend asking real doctors or professionals to see if a product is right for you."
4,hgg did dyshdg,"The app works great for finding healthy products, but I find that it tends to have some issues with the nutritional value. Foods are dropped dozens of points because they are ‚Äú(a bit) too caloric‚Äù. Not everyone is a middle aged obese woman trying to lose weight‚Äîas someone who wants to GAIN weight and eat MORE calories, more is better for me (assuming it‚Äôs not processed junk). The app also makes some very strange decisions, often rating low and then replacing good foods with ones that are much less healthy but have better ratings (ex: recommending my protein bar with 21g of protein and 190cal that has 2g of sugar and a small amount of additives [according to the app it claims that the bar has 220cal] be replaced with a bar that is 20 points higher but has 210cal, 12g of protein, and significantly higher amounts of sugar and salt [13g of sugar, 260mg of salt]). There is additionally no way to know the exact nutritional information (no nutrition facts label). The app also fails to scan items that have small barcodes, which can be problematic."
4,Health+First,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a little while and I do enjoy it. It definitely brings knowledge to what health conscious ppl should avoid and why. The recommendations are very helpful as well. I think as long as the app updates and improves overtime it will be vital. One thing I did notice is that the app doesn‚Äôt notify for industrial seed oils. So I look for them in the ingredients on my own. But would be helpful to integrate this. The seed oils are in nearly everything packaged and one of the biggest reasons for built up inflammation in the body. Would like the app to consider adding a flag or notification for canola, corn, soybean oils etc.  With that in mind, it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to remove entirely, especially in families with kids that have junk at school or grandma‚Äôs. It‚Äôs going to come down to more awareness from people to push back on these things to force companies to do better. All that said I do recommend this app. It‚Äôs a great tool in the fight against the terribly addictive & bad foods."
5,KGwoood,"After using this app for a few days, I was so pleased with it that I decided to go premium for the additional benefits.  I have scanned almost all of my face and body products and many of my food products.  If it is a known product you get a rating based on ingredients, along with a list of ingredients and information regarding known hazards and possible allergies etc‚Ä¶. If the product isn‚Äôt known, you can easily submit information by filling in product name, brand, and submitting a few photos of label and ingredients.  Also, you get a list of alternatives with better ratings.  I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but it is quick- like an hour or two. I have been surprised that some of the higher price products I have purchased have some very poor ratings, while their less expensive counterparts have high ratings. If you‚Äôre picky about what you put on and in your body (and your kids), I highly recommend this app."
5,gravesgirl,"With the mind boggling amount of harmful additives that we all consume or put on our skin everyday, I‚Äôm hard pressed to think of a more vital app. So user friendly, just point and scan. My husband and I swear by Yuka and peddle it onto everyone and anyone who will listen. We truly had no idea how horrible our diets were until we got this app. We thought we had ‚Äúbad genetics‚Äù and were both chubby. Now that the veil is lifted and we can really see all of the chemicals and garbage we were eating, we have completely swapped the brands we used to buy for healthier alternatives and have been steadily losing weight because of it.   I‚Äôve also changed out a lot of my expensive hair care and skin care products and am much more aware of what I buy. I really can‚Äôt stress how important this app is for everyone. I can almost guarantee this app with make a positive difference in your life."
5,Shay Shay baby,"I‚Äôm a disabled Veteran and I started using this app to get more healthy, I never expected after 2 months of changing my diet completely and products I use to not only help me lose 15lbs but also to help all my nerve and joint pain. I also noticed a lot less migraines and sleep was a lot better.  Once I learned about the harmful ingredients I was able to research them and find out a lot of the things I thought was either post covid or aging, was actually what I was eating.  It is difficult at first to get the right diet for you but not because of the app‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs difficult cause so many things in our stores are so harmful but Don‚Äôt Give Up!!! You can do this! I promise it‚Äôs so worth it!!!  I am so grateful for this app and I make sure to tell anyone in passing which keeps the spreading of such a informative tool that actually helps us with no gimmicks or strings attached!!  Can‚Äôt thank you enough Yuka Team!!!!!"
5,ClassOnSass,"I absolutely love this app. It helps me make better choices for my health and the health of my loved ones. I do have 2 suggestions though: 1) it would be awesome if you guys can add laundry detergent options as well as beauty. 2) I really wish there was a way for the developers to include where to buy the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù products. Like when you scan something, and it says ‚Äúpoor‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, it then suggests a better product, which is great, but it doesn‚Äôt say where I can buy it, so it‚Äôs kinda leaving me without options, y‚Äôknow? You‚Äôre telling me this product is better for me, okay, but you‚Äôre not telling me where I can find it or if it‚Äôs near me or if I have to buy it online depending on my GPS location. I think a new feature like that would help IMMENSELY. Other than that, this is one of the best apps on the AppStore in my opinion, keep up the amazing work that you guys do!"
5,loveizlaw,"Thank you, Merci!!! my sister told me about this app the other day so I instantly downloaded it and now I‚Äôm a barcode monster! I have gone around my house and gotten rid of so many beauty products that are probably the source of all of my allergies! I feel so grateful for the work that you have done and also overjoyed that you are not being led by big companies! Please stay real for the people! I did a little research and realized that you are French and even though I was born in America and live back here now, I spent 15 years in France and that is where a part of my soul resides! Your work is truly appreciated and NEEDED today! I am telling everyone about your app and spreading it on social media. Thank you again for creating this! Everything we do can make this world a better place if what we do is for the good of ourselves and for the good all! It‚Äôs so important to bring awareness! Bless you!!"
5,georgehduru,"This app is so useful a must have for everyone. This app has helped me improve my health by giving me alternatives to foods that contain harmful additives. I use to eat just about anything that is until I downloaded this app. It is crazy how many companies don‚Äôt care about the consumers health and will add just about any harmful additive, food dyes, and oils.   Now every time I go grocery shopping I scan and know what brands to avoid and which to get. After downloading this app and sticking with my diet of healthy/ organic foods I have to say that I feel younger than my age! I am full of energy and best of all I‚Äôm taking care of my health being ! I  highly encourage everyone to download this app and see the great benefits of eating healthy yourself. I also encourage those to support the creators and buy premium as they worked very hard and decided to give us this amazing application for free! Thank you Yuka"
4,Jareddamm,"This app is a literal godsend.  The fact that it's completely free and add free (as far as I've experienced using it) blows my mind and really restores my faith in humanity.  To the developers of this app, thank you so much for doing the people this amazing act of kindness.  Everyone should have this app.  My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars out of 5 is that while using it yesterday it gave ""Excellent"" and ""good"" ratings on tortilla chips that were cooked in Seed oil.  I understand the research and findings on seed oils causing harm to the human body are somewhat new but it would be nice if the apps database could be updated on that, as it is nearly impossible to find any sort of chips, crackers or really any baked goods that are not made with seed or vegetable oils, so I was really hoping the app would make it easier for me to find products that are not, but it's a good reminder to always do your own research and to let apps ASSIST you and not decide for you."
1,Brooke O. - Ohio,"My sister introduced this app to me, but apparently has a different version because when I just downloaded it, we realized my version is lacking the features that we both liked the most on her app. For example, we both scan the same product - a simple aquafor lotion - and the view is entirely different. It does not show you recommendations, nothing is categorized, you have to manually drop down a list to view ingredients and it doesn‚Äôt show you the actual rating system for those ingredients. Hers is SO much nicer and I can see why she likes it so much. It‚Äôs a shame because I was so bought into it after seeing hers that I downloaded and became a premium member and I immediately regret that choice now knowing my version isn‚Äôt the same and this app now feels useless because the features that were most convenient aren‚Äôt easily accessible anymore. It‚Äôs a shame that they got rid of some important features that align with their purpose. Until they fix this recent update, don‚Äôt download this app. Maybe it‚Äôs a new bug, but I won‚Äôt be using it until it‚Äôs fixed! Please fix this app!"
5,Robin S - MI/TN/FL,"Finding out what is making me sick and others alike for this app. Once you clear just about everything in your home that‚Äôs effecting you, your on a new road to better health. Scanning at stores you start meeting people wanting to know what your doing. People are out there with real problems and no answers, me included. Knowledge is key to good health and if we have to scan everything we will do it. Exposing how bad the products we buy now explains the unnecessary suffering. Praying the this app, the people that create this and maintain the information never stray or sell out to the corrupt. Please stay on course  and save these suffering people one scan at a time. Thank you for making a difference one scan at a time. I have met so many people, heard their stories and truly understand how important this app has become. Thank you!"
5,StarWintergirl1,"I have no idea how a majority of the people I know, including myself have not heard of this app sooner. I had no idea half the things I was using such as hair products, deodorant, and even beauty products were harmful for me. And I am not going to lie, there still are some things I will continue to buy that I am aware are not the healthiest choice for me, such as snacks or beauty products. However , if I can tweak and exchange some things out for healthier products I will and have done so in order to take care of myself better. Because girl I am still gonna eat hot Cheetos üòÇüò≠ but I love and am so OBSESSED with this app. Every time I go to the store I use it to scan to make sure at least the majority of things I get are good for me to use. And what I love is knowing this app is not promoting or trying to bash Brands. It is a genuine app that is just trying to show in detail what each ingredient is."
4,Theresa CB.,"It is a perfect app that educates on the types of chemicals within a product and how they can specifically affect your health. I love it. I‚Äôve learned so much, but I have one specific request. I would like a filter to choose certain options for certain chemicals to avoid completely; for example, I have a thyroid condition, so I would love to avoid endocrine disruptors from all products if possible and it would be so much easier to have the app avoid those products automatically without me having to look at each products chemicals each and every time. As a prime user, I would love for this app to continue to develop, and I believe that this feature I am requesting would be a next great step towards further development. As a user, I am pleased to have this app in my life, because I use it on a daily basis to help me navigate my allergies and so on. Just please consider it, thank you. üòä"
5,Pie Pod,"download this app and help do your part to stop food companies from putting hazardous chemicals in their products! The more that people scan and learn about these disgusting chemicals put in packaged foods the more we can stop them. And create healthy humans that don‚Äôt need synthetic drugs and are constantly hospitalized for things that can be easily fixed and cured by not eating chemical based synthetically created genetically modified food products. Stop being lazy and be conscientious of what you put in your body. This app will help you realize. Your full health potential and how you‚Äôre harming yourself by eating stuff like Wheat Thins and Kirkland brand canned tuna, fish and using lotions like Aveeno.  Once you scan something and realize that it has for hazardous chemicals, it‚Äôs very difficult to justify buying it or using it ever again!!!!!  if you have thyroid issues this app is for you!"
3,wj4,"This is hands down the missing peice to nutrition facts in the modern food/household goods supply. The detailed explanation and source references to common additives is invaluable for distinguishing between ""healthy"" and safe food and household products. Because the product database is crowd sourced, there are still significant gaps when trying to find data-- but the concept is solid. I would like to see product identification by a SKU/vendor cross reference, as sometimes the same product may appear in multiple stores under different SKUs.   The UI needs a lot of work to make quick-referencing products easier. For instance, favorites and my products are isolated lists and should be combined. My products only works if the user scans and enters information themself. I would also love to see an integration with apps like Shipt or Instacart so I can quickly add/filter items I frequently order.  Bottom line: This is worth the annual subscription fee; just be patient with the UI."
5,RJhamlin,"I am a nursing school educator for almost 20 years.  Nursing patient practice twice that long. Teaching illness disease prevention and healthy food choices is probably the one most important single important choices people make above medications, vaccines, health promotion you can use. The foods we eat, artificial additives and chemicals, processed high sugar content is the leading cause of cancers and cardiovascular stroke diabetes hypertension illnesses. And the choices you make to eat nutrition rich diets can give your incredible body support to fight illness naturally better than any supplements. Supplements can help but can never replace good food choices. Your body is a miracle of wonder when you support it with the nutrients to fix, heal, and defend yourself against illness disease bacteria and viruses!!  Use this app time you shop and it will be the  beginning of a longer healthy life."
5,aki ‚ô°Ô∏é,"The app is super easy to use and there's no limit on how many items you can scan within a certain amount of days much like some other apps I know. I do use this app mainly to choose which skincare and makeup items to use so I love that it's so easy to scan things and find whats good for your skin right away instead of sitting in aisles and reading the ingredients.   One improvemnt I would recommend though is adding a feature where the app tells you which skin type the product would have better affects on. Telling you whether or not it would work wonders on your skin type (dry, oily, or combination) would really be a game changer and I think it would just be so much more convinent.   Overall, the app is amazing, you do have to pay to be able to look certain products, but that's not a huge issue for me personally."
5,Jkajsjsoodkwkp,"i‚Äôve always been extremely cautious about what I put into an on my body I tried looking up certain words I see ingredients that I know aren‚Äôt natural and I would have to figure out if it is safe one by one. this app put everything right in front of your eyes it explains every single ingredient in detail and also let you know in a clear and simple way how much of a risk it is for your health (good, low risk, moderate risk) and also says out of 100 how healthy it is for your body. i‚Äôve been wanting to write in a journal every ingredient I can find and if they are bad for you but now I can just pull it up on my phone whenever I need to know! this app is amazing and I truly do hope that they get more subscribers. I will definitely be promoting it on my social media‚Äòs more people need to be aware of the benefits from this appü§ç"
5,jbhfineart,"I have been only buying cosmetic products that get an excellent rating on Yuka since knowing about the app. I have dealt with an eyelid irritation since I was probably around 13, when I started wearing makeup. I‚Äôve tried switching to different products in the past for eye makeup and moisturizers that claim to be for sensitive skin, but nothing has changed my need to use a prescription medication to calm down the irritation. Even going with no eye makeup and just a moisturizer for many months hasn‚Äôt solved this issue. With my new cosmetic and moisturizer selections based on Yuka‚Äôs suggestions, I have had almost no irritation and have not had to use the prescription medication once. I‚Äôm still not exactly sure which ingredients were causing the problem. All I know is, my new products are not causing them, and I‚Äôm so pleased about that."
1,AAA20thousandtimes,"Do not buy this app. This app is very misleading and makes products and foods seem more or less dangerous than they actually are. This app relies on high amounts to base their answers on. For example, for skincare products, they base it on high concentration levels of the ingredients even though skincare products are legally not allowed to sell products with such high amounts of ingredients that can be toxic in high level consumption. To make that ingredient not toxic, brands only allow small amounts to make it safe for human consumption. This app doesn‚Äôt consider the exposure (the concentration of the ingredient). Many products are considered hazardous but are still safe to use. Thats because they‚Äôre only hazardous/harmful if used in high concentration, which are never used in cosmetics. And for foods, the app only rates foods on how caloric they are, not how good they are for humans. Many‚Äôs foods will be rated badly just because they are higher in calories, even if they‚Äôre natural and entirely better for humans. This is called fear mongering! Make better decisions instead of relying on an app to tell you what is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù."
5,mobopolo,"I‚Äôve found this App really useful.  Not just at the store, but in my home too.  I started scanning products that I already have, yikes!  I thought I was doing better, but some of my choices weren‚Äôt so great.  For example my husband has bought original Speed Stick deodorant for years.  I wanted him to try the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù Mando brand.  My husband thought the app was silly until he discovered he was buying a healthier brand. When I scanned them to show him.  Lol!  He was pretty proud of himself. I also love that it gives you a list of items that are better for you.  With real pictures so when you‚Äôre standing in the grocery aisle you can scan quickly to find it.  It even helps with online shopping too. Before I make a recipe now I do a quick check on brands to shop for.  It‚Äôs really quick and easy to navigate.  Thank you!"
2,pamelaev,"Downloaded the app and scanned 1st item: Crisco Veggie Oil, Wow. This scans as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù! Really? Check the ingredients list. It‚Äôs Soybean oil a GMO product that‚Äôs part of the bad oils group which are being used in 1000s of products and at practically every restaurant in the US. These are being marketed as ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô because the FDA approved them. These oils are slowly poisoning our society, causing inflammation with every bite. They are terrible for your BRAIN, heart, and hormones. The FDA serves a purpose but is also part of the broken food system currently making Americans increasingly fat, tired and sick. Just a little research reveals that these highly refined oils, when heated up - as in for frying/ cooking‚Ä¶ they increase inflammation in the blood and increases your risk of heart disease. SUGGESTION: Add a feature to your app that allows people to create TAGS for ingredients THEY want to avoid. That way, the many people who prefer food selections based on their own research about what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù can make use of it.  This version is useless to me if it gives a thumbs up to these terrible oils."
3,Saphire_1232,"Okay. So I love the concept of this app, and I love the countless number of products registered into its database! It has a great ability to spot the nutritional benefits in everything despite the product.   However I‚Äôm, personally, not a fan of the good/bad ratings that the products are labeled with. It does make things much simpler to categorize, I‚Äôm just not too sure it‚Äôs a great idea to villainize foods based on the number of calories they have, nutritional info.. so on and so forth. Just my intake on it^^   I also found that some products I‚Äôve done extensive research on, in regards to health, were considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù. When in reality, they were one of the most nutritionally dense foods I‚Äôve ever found! Purely Elizabeth granola for example! I just wonder whether or not this app actually takes into account a products ingredients and not just the number of calories or how many grams of sugar or carbs are in it. Perhaps the ingredient lists need to be updated‚Ä¶? Please do correct me if I‚Äôm wrong:)"
5,Pete0145,"This app is what the nutritional facts should have on the back of every product. It gives you a score and it tells you exactly which ingredients are good, which ones are unhealthy and even links to studies that show the reasoning behind why an ingredient is unhealthy. Adding a new product is a breeze, it takes photos and autofills all the information for you. The cost for premium is also very reasonable $8/year I believe and you can use it for free too. Best and only app I pay for on the App Store.  The one feature I‚Äôd like to see someday is the ability to add any boycot/ethical shopping preferences such as if you don‚Äôt want to support a massive food conglomerate or a specific country (BDS for example‚Äîplease don‚Äôt @ me on this topic, people have a right to do business (or not) with whomever they choose, that‚Äôs what it means to live in a free country)"
5,Sammalot,"So I‚Äôve had this app for four years now but I never paid for the subscription; it was still doing its justice. I recently pay for the subscription and I love it even more. Now I can just search up any product when I need to. I have contact dermatitis I don‚Äôt have to try new products and hope my skin doesn‚Äôt flake up, I can literally just search up hair gels and see which products have dermatitis causing ingredients. I am so thankful for this app, it‚Äôs honestly made a difference in my life.   Also sidenote for the developers, it would be so cool if yuka had a feature where you could filter out certain ingredients from your search. For example if I need a product that doesn‚Äôt have Phenoxyethanol I can just filter it out and have the list of products there. Thank you so much for this amazing app‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,Soitsme,"Impressive app with lots of good details and info. Also, for the most part free. Where it looses a star is there‚Äôs an inconsistency with the rating. Example: there‚Äôs only one ingredient that changed in the same brand product, blueberries for lime, same nutritional values and the rating will be very different. The other reason is the recommendations are way off. Replacing a vegan item for one with animal products in it is hard no. Or recommending something that really isn‚Äôt better. Original item has four natural ingredients that are good for you but a little higher in calories. Recommended item has three of the original and four others. Two of which aren‚Äôt really good for you but rate higher than the original. I‚Äôve been using this for well over a year and it seems the ratings need a little bit of a closer look and the recommendations a strong overhaul. Everything else is superb."
4,Mama044,"I absolutely love this app , learning about all the different risks in cosmetics! I would‚Äôve never knew .. buu sometimes it be weird like I scanned a product and then recommend a product that was excellent! then I bought that product scanned it to see what it would say then it said bad ? how you gonna recommend that ‚Äúexcellent ‚Äúproduct then say it‚Äôs bad ? this app definitely need to review and update and maybe should put all the information of products it‚Äôs self ! definitely needs to gain control of the app.   And another thing is you scan something n it‚Äôs like the totally opposite product, like I scanned facial toner and then it recommended got2 be hairspray ? Definitely needs to get ahold of the problems and maybe add why certain ingredients are poor or bad or risky ? Like okay this is poor buu why ? What don‚Äôt that poor ingredient do ? . BUT I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS APP!"
5,dupt12,This app is a game changer. I love that you can scan foods or cosmetics/beauty products and it will give you healthier options. I found out the majority of my high end cosmetics & hair and beauty products were actually awful and the healthier options are quite a bit cheaper. I love that you can search items as well instead of just having to scan if you get the membership. The membership fee is super affordable. You can personalize gluten/vegan/dairy options. It‚Äôs just an all around great app & definitely helps you make better choices. The only thing I wish it included were supplements. It‚Äôs honestly a relief feeling like you have a better understanding of what is actually in the things yourself as well as your children are consuming and they explain the chemical and what it does etc. I can‚Äôt  love this app enough.
5,ohhmygodtakethereview,I downloaded this app when my first born was around 6 months old and have always used it anytime I was at the stores! It has helped me so much in deciding what is harmful for our bodies and will always recommend it! I am going on 2 years now of being a Yuka user and will not stop! I recently had to replace my phone and unfortunately was locked out of my account and it wasn‚Äôt letting me reset my password and I have been so sad but decided to try and ema the email I had gotten from them in the beginning and to my surprise someone actually responded in a very timely manner!! I was able to explain my situation and Camilla reset my password for me and got me back into my account literally within 10 minutes of my response to her! I am honestly so happy with the customer service from them and will always be a Yuka user üß°üß°
5,bm340991,"I use this app daily. I don‚Äôt buy anything anymore without scanning it on Yuka first. I have switched almost every product I use on a daily basis: deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, face lotion, hand soap, chapstick, eye liner, toothpaste, etc. I‚Äôve made numerous alternative food choices from scanning products on Yuka first. My wife and I enjoy walking throughout our grocery store and scanning products for fun just to see what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs not.   My only complaint is that Yuka doesn‚Äôt rate certain products like laundry detergent or dishwashing detergent, etc. I‚Äôm not sure why they wouldn‚Äôt add this being that they‚Äôre already rating hand soaps. I wish Yuka would expand to being able to scan all products. I‚Äôm working towards eliminating toxic products in my life, but there‚Äôs still many things that Yuka doesn‚Äôt evaluate. Lots of opportunity still there!"
5,FalKirk,"I almost never write reviews, but I had to write a review about this program because it is so good.  First, I‚Äôve been on a diet for about nine months. I‚Äôve been focused solely on calories and knew that I was consuming some foods that were probably not nutritious or good for me. Getting the Yuka app serves all of my purposes. Since it takes calories into account ‚Äî along with many, many other important factors ‚Äî I can simply buy highly rated foods from the Yuka app and know that I am getting both nutritious and calorie reasonable meals. It has completely altered the way that I buy food.  Second, the app is much easier to use than many other apps. I‚Äôm sure you know what it‚Äôs like to have a very powerful app that is also very difficult to use. Yuka provides tremendous information in a very easy to use and understand format.  Third, and finally ‚Äî and most certainly not least ‚Äî is the fact that I have contacted customer care on a couple of occasions and their responses have been fantastic! They get back to you within 48 hours (usually much faster) and they are extremely responsive and helpful. I just cannot speak highly enough of their customer care.  I cannot recommend this this program highly enough. Very much worth the money and more."
4,Leumis7,"The app itself is absolutely fantastic - lightning fast, intuitive, easy to navigate, and everything else that a great app should be. Really really well-developed.  The accuracy side, however, is not perfect. Some items don‚Äôt always have the right nutrition facts or additives, so it‚Äôs always important to double check the label before making any changes. That being said, the process for submitting a correction is super easy and (I assume) has verification built in. And while the specifics about each product aren‚Äôt always right, every harmful additive has sources cited for why it‚Äôs bad that are linked in the app.   Overall, I couldn‚Äôt be much happier with the app, it‚Äôs just important to remember that the ingredient lists and nutrition facts aren‚Äôt guaranteed to be accurate and should always be checked with the label of the actual product before making a decision about anything."
2,Amilli22,"Just about everything I scan has a very low rating from products in my home to things I randomly scan on shelves. You might as well just say everything is bad for you.   It almost seems like this app tells you good things or gives higher ratings about products they want you to buy. I scan one aloe Vera gel that lists on its own bottle that it‚Äôs free from retinyl palmitate which is clearly a good thing, but the app recommends me another gel that says it does have retinyl palmitate and says it‚Äôs no risk and gives this gel a very good rating. Too many things just don‚Äôt add up  Also, I tried adding an item that they didn‚Äôt know. Took time to type out all the ingredients listed, the product and brand for the app to tell me it couldn‚Äôt add it or give a rating. A product that has several ingredients that massive amounts of other products already on the app also have in them, yet, they couldn‚Äôt tell me if it was good, bad or otherwise ü§î. I‚Äôm not sure why this app has such a high rating"
5,TylerIggy,"I saw people using this app on social medias and since im trying to be more conscious about what i pit on and in my body this app has been my best friend when im out shopping and has encouraged me to read the labels more often and on my own! I highly recommend this app for multiple reasons, it could lower the chances of harsher chemicals being used in our everyday products if there sales go down and hopefully help companies stop cutting so many corners.  In order to have good works you need healthy workers! So be more consious of your body and take care of it‚ù§Ô∏è It will thank you in the long run. Also not only products but making your own diy products made of natural ingredients will cut down costs and skin issues and intestinal issues. Reading lables of healthier products will give you a good example of what ingredients to buy!"
1,ChristianMIR,"Alright so I installed this app after seeing people throw away a bunch of products over stupid things like SLS being ‚Äúhazardous‚Äù‚Ä¶ wait wait wait haven‚Äôt I done this before‚Ä¶ ohhhh right that time where I did that exact thing and bought a bunch of products which were actually way more terrible than normal products.   This app basically reviews ingredients without the proper measurement of such ingredients, as well as using improper research methods to prove such claims. Lets say there was an article stated which included ‚Äúswallowing products containing SLS‚Äù (just an example!) Do you swallow products with SLS in them? No. You use them on your body, you don‚Äôt eat products with them.   You‚Äôre wasting money if you want to use this app. Many certified dermatologists online also agree. The best actions you can do for following great products like beauty types of products, are asking your dermatologist, doctor, or watching videos by dermatologists and doctors online. ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you‚Äôre struggling finding healthy foods online, you can follow diet recommendations and such."
5,Essep12,"Not being much of an app user, this app needs to be on everyone‚Äôs ‚Äúmust‚Äù list. Why? Because if you care about the foods you ingest or the products you use on your body, not to mention what you give your children and family, this is where to begin saying goodbye to items you thought were fine but learn they are anything but.  How our government and food companies can promote products as appearing to be fine, only to learn they contain carcinogenic compounds, chemicals that impact estrogen and liver function, and well beyond is nothing short of alarming. This issue must be brought to the fore via national media and beyond.  This team has done far more than develop an app; they are helping consumers to be educated and realize just why we have the health and medical issues we have. Kudos to this incredible team."
3,VioletPomPom,"This app seems very well made and I appreciate the effort put into it to allow people to have easy access to information regarding what food they consume and products they buy but I'm concerned that it is funded by businesses or corporations that end up misleading users. I tried to scan a diet Mountain Dew and usually it gives me the info or allows me to provide a new product to be reviewed, but I wasn‚Äôt given either option. All I get is ‚ÄúYuka does not rate this type of product.‚Äù Which is strange because it allowed me to scan other Pepsi products or even just soda in general so it‚Äôs strange that that specific item isn‚Äôt allowed. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs diet? Either way I think it‚Äôs puzzling and suspicious but it shouldn‚Äôt take away from all the other very helpful information this app provides. Even if they are funded by some big corporation they have their sources and for the most part this app seems accurate so idk."
3,CatLady50,"The app does have some useful nutritional info, some of which is not on the  product labels, and for that reason alone I will continue to use the app.  But I don‚Äôt agree with the rating system. The ratings take a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach, which limits their usefulness.  Anything it deems too high in sugar, fat, or salt is flagged as ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  For example, it flagged a liquid aminos product I‚Äôve used for years as ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it‚Äôs too high in salt.  But I‚Äôve never had high blood pressure, so salt is not a problem for me.  I also think some fat is necessary in one‚Äôs diet.  If I were to follow the app‚Äôs advice, I‚Äôd only eat vegetables and little else.  However, I‚Äôm a vegetarian with IBS, so I watch my FODMAP intake.  I didn‚Äôt see this information anywhere in the app.  My point is that people are different, so a blanket approach doesn‚Äôt work for everyone.  Also, a product like Himalayan Pink salt, which is rich in minerals, has a very different effect on the body than ordinary table salt.  I tried to add it, but the only 2 salt categories were ‚Äútable salt‚Äù and ‚Äúsea salt‚Äù and this is neither.  So I gave up.  In addition, there are lots of products not in your database.  This is understandable in a new app, but the process to add new products should be less cumbersome.  This app is fine for people who know absolutely nothing about nutrition.  But everyone should take the ratings with a ‚Äúgrain of salt‚Äù."
5,Juls1037,"Wow!! I‚Äôm very selective about taking my time to write reviews when I feel it‚Äôs warranted good or bad. I have to say been pretty blown away by this app just even on the free version. We scan everything now and I‚Äôm amazed by what I‚Äôm learning. Things I thought were good choices for my family, I‚Äôm coming to understand isn't always the case. I‚Äôm taking the time to read why as it‚Äôs also beautifully broken down into sections completely explain why the choice is good or bad. Thank you to the creator for making such an awesome app! Makes learning about these things engaging. Even if you don‚Äôt wanna learn about the why‚Äôs. Your first shown a score making it super simple to determine whether to make the purchase or not. Highly recommend to learn how to make healthier choices for their family."
2,Nb92661,"This app is somewhat helpful but it is not 100% accurate. I‚Äôve had to correct several products that were rated ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, but were in fact ‚ÄúBad‚Äù. The ingredients were incorrect. They need to limit users from adding products if they submit incorrect ingredients. Then also give the people who correct products a star rating or something that differentials the people submitting inaccurate info from the people who submit the correct info. Also they need to list the food ingredients similar to how they list beauty products ingredients. How will we know if someone has listed the proper food ingredients when they are not visible to the user. I hate how reporting into forces use of the apple mail app. This is so archaic are inconvenient. I use gmail so I will not install the apple mail app because the developers can‚Äôt figure out how to let you report info any other way. Please fix! I have several more suggestions but I‚Äôll write another review later."
2,Whatishealrhy?,"So many relatively healthy food items are flagged for too much sodium. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it should be avoided altogether. Serving size plays a huge role. If an item is flagged based on the serving size on the package it should be noted to consume smaller portions as every other ingredient is fine and can be a healthy choice in moderation. Also I am finding alot of items rated as good or excellent that have seed oils, which are overly processed, can cause inflammation and are high in omega 6‚Äôs. When I scan an item which contains avocado oil it generally indicates too much saturated fat. I believe olive oil and avocado oil are healthier options but your app typically shoots them down. Then there are items that just make no sense at all like Aurora organic unsalted cashews which indicates too many calories and too much fat and recommend the alertanive of Kirkland brand cashews that is also organic and unsalted. What‚Äôs the difference? Nuts and seeds in moderation are a healthy choice in a diet.  That‚Äôs just my opinion on this app thus far."
4,meghanbishop98,"I found this app suggested on Lemon8 and after downloading, scanned every product in my cabinet. Some I was really surprised at! Such as many highly respected health-toteing brands actually have multiple products with toxic ingredients. I would‚Äôve never known! All items I‚Äôve found on the app have the correct ingredients for the product. You buy the expensive product because it has retinol or peptides and don‚Äôt question all the other ingredients. Aside from the beauty supplies, this app has changed the way I grocery shop. When I think of a food I might want to buy in the future, I first look it up on the Yuka app and determine if I should make a different choice in food or brand! I looked up raspberry jam today and found two products with an Excellent rating and then added one to my future shopping list. Yuka helps me buy smarter.  The only downside is that features are still being built out since it‚Äôs user funded and in on-going development stages.   I recommend that we can categorize our favorites! I‚Äôd like to separate beauty products from food products and even fruits from vegetables from snacks. This way when I go in my favorites, it‚Äôs easier to quickly navigate and find what I‚Äôm looking for.   Thank you sm! Can‚Äôt wait to see the future of the app."
5,BrianH1098,"If you take your nutrition serious and really want to see what is in your food, then this is the app for you. I was shocked and amazed to think of all the things I was putting in my body that was toxic for me and cancer is such a huge problem nowadays I think we could all learn something from this app. This app has me rethinking a lot of things and things I am going to change in my life. There are so much process junk in all these foods, and this app will help you to avoid making those poor choices. It‚Äôs not going to give you alternatives, but that is your job to figure it out. If you are taking your nutrition serious it‚Äôs a no-brainer I don‚Äôt think this app needs to have an alternative food source for something that you pick that is no good for you as other reviewers have mentioned"
5,Peachy526,"This app answers the question that I have over and over again standing in the grocery store of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs healthier?‚Äù  It‚Äôs a true necessity for me now whenever I shop. I‚Äôve often been so surprised of what foods are actually worse for me since they try to trick you on the label. I‚Äôm trying out new foods thanks to the recommendations on the app.   The only addition that I wish the app had was a ‚ÄúComments‚Äù type section on each product where users can leave reviews of the food. Yes something may be healthier for you, but is it good? Once I find a good recommendation I often have to leave the app to search elsewhere for reviews of the product before purchasing. It would be nice to have this all on one place on the app.   Other than that, thank you for this amazing tool!"
3,boring7278,First of all this app is great it can scan for the nutrition facts and all that but till we go to the ingredients like there are like dangerous things that can happen to people but you just can‚Äôt scare people like that I mean like the information is helpful but like it‚Äôs just too scary even though it‚Äôs right but sometimes the ingredient is even in the product I see always dangerous stuff people eat but nothing happens to them. I‚Äôve been eating healthy but most of the things I can‚Äôt eat. Also another problem like how much grams like sugar and carbs and protein also fat it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not that much and there at the yellow/red zone. I don‚Äôt know why like the app wants me to eat 0 calories. I need some calories too. But like the rest of the app it‚Äôs good a ref and a history also there‚Äôs something missing where did that green yellow orange and red go it was replaced by a new one please bring it back kinda good app.
5,Burritoface123,"This app has truly been life-changing. It has helped me identify and eliminate so many so-called ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods and ‚Äúclean‚Äù cosmetics that were harming me. I first heard about this app from an 11 year old son of a friend, and I sincerely wish every child and family would use it.  After years of suffering from heavy metal poisoning (due to living and working in one of the most polluted ZIP codes in the country) this app has been a vital tool in my detox and recovery journey. It‚Äôs empowering me to make informed choices as I continue striving for a healthier, happier life.   I don‚Äôt usually write app reviews (think this might be my first) but I am so incredibly grateful for this app and felt compelled to do so in order to give a very heartfelt and huge thanks to the developers for creating something so life changing üôèüôèüôèüôè"
5,iamhelpful,"It‚Äôs going to be hard to believe or prove, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had stage 1 kidney disease for about 5 years now and blood work 3 months ago also picked up something going on with my thyroid.  Downloaded Yuka and changed soooo many products that we use‚Ä¶. Especially products we use on our skin. Lotions, soaps, makeup, shampoos..   etc.  Took my bloodwork again after 3 months because they wanted to look at my thyroid again‚Ä¶.. At my doctor appointment, all she talked about was my cholesterol. I asked her about my kidneys and thyroid. She said ‚Äúthey are normal ‚Äú!!!! What?!!  I tell everyone I know about Yuka. I never knew what was in products and I guessed everything had been verified as safe or they wouldn‚Äôt be able to sell it.  Thank you so much for opening my eyes and helping me improve my health!!!"
5,Nonapie,"I was introduced to this App by my daughter-in-law; we both were working on becoming more ‚Äúorganic‚Äù in our choices. This App is so easy to use, yet so revealing that we filled a garbage can with food and cosmetics that were filled with hazardous ingredients.   It is very revealing to find the number of hazardous elements that are allowed in, not only our cosmetics, but in our food! I was appalled. But Yuka gives us quite a variety of healthy and safe alternatives to replace the items that we threw away. Now we are familiar with the healthy brands and can build a relationship with them.   I never would have know that certain additives were harmful, even banned by other countries, that are allowed in the products we use in the U.S. So you will not regret downloading this App. All you have to do is scan the barcode on makeup, soap, and foods of every kind to find out if they score Bad-Poor-Good or Excellent.   On a humorous note, my son scanned my bottle of Jack Daniels whisky and Yuka‚Äôs response was, ‚ÄúWe do not rate alcohol. But you know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù  We laughed about that for an hour!  I highly recommend Yuka. It will rate your product, give you recommendations and explain what is good or bad about the one rated. Spread the word!"
5,BusyBee59,"A coworker told me about Yuka and I immediately downloaded it to my phone. It just so happened that I was making a grocery store run later in the day. I used the app to help me make some better choices in products. I went home and checked out my shampoos and lotions, oh my! I appreciate the recommendations that are provided when products rate poorly.  And it was fun to discover that I have made some very good product choices. I think I will find this app even more helpful when I want to try a new product but am unsure if it is really as good as they make it out to be. Also, it keeps a history of the items you have scanned so you can go back and reference them at anytime.   If you are wondering if the products you are buying are as good as they claim, this app is for you!"
5,heydnzns,"Loved this app. I originally got it for hygienic product as I‚Äôve seen a massive improvement in my skin switching from skincare with active ingredients to using dr bronners bar soap and vaseline. But this app does everything! Not only does it tell you the exact information on all of the ingredients in your products, it notify you which is high medium or low risk and how they can affect certain groups. Not to mention, they also have recommendations for healthier switches for ANYTHING! Yes, I‚Äôm becoming a super crunchy Karen, but I love this app. They do too rated reccomendations aswell! They don‚Äôt favor certain brands, I‚Äôve seen expsensive companies like Whole Foods to more cost affordable companies like Walmart all in the same tally. Great app for people wanting to become healthier"
5,Olgakay,I was in Costco trying to read a very small label to see if product contained seed oils when another customer told me about this app and scanned the product for me. So impressed so went home and downloaded the app. Started scanning my pantry and then my bathroom cabinet. How shocked was I as the bathroom cabinet contents. Worse offenders are the so called natural products and sunscreens especially those targeted at kids. I am now on a mission to share this app with all my friends and family as well as complete strangers I see trying to read labels. So far I have approached 3 strangers trying to read the small print and they have been so grateful that some of them downloaded the app in the store. Thank you for a wonderful app that is so easy to use and really life changing.
5,lover gurll,I just started using this app last week. I found it on Tik tok and ever since I‚Äôve been scanning stuff around my kitchen to see if healthy stuff I had like granola bars were healthy and they weren‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt surprised that most of the stuff I had was rated poor or bad from the app since there is a lot of sugary stuff in my kitchen but now that I‚Äôm aware of it I want to prevent myself from buying more unhealthy food so when I go to the grocery store I scanned products to see if it was worth buying and it‚Äôs really convenient since it tells you why it‚Äôs rated excellent food bad or poor. I love this app!!! And it also prevents me from buying stuff that is marked as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù when it isn‚Äôt. There are so many good things about this app I love it so much it‚Äôs the best app to exist!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Alaska90777,"I never write reviews or rate apps, but I had to for this one!  This app is so convenient & helpful, I use it every time I go shopping, I LOVE IT!!  I like how it simply says if a product is rated ‚Äúexcellent, good, poor, or bad‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is very helpful in being able to chose the right products, makes everything so much easier.  I also like how it lists the sources where the information can be confirmed, about the ingredients, how they react to our body & what health problems they can cause.  I especially love how it also lists recommendations for other better product choices if a product is rated either ‚Äúpoor or bad‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so VERY convenient & helpful!  I literally cannot live without this app, it‚Äôs the best!  Thank you sooo very much for this amazing app, I use it everyday!!! :)"
5,Studio X Music,"Unfortunately our FDA is on the take from food manufacturers who find that it is more important to make a lot of money than do the right thing by making foods that don‚Äôt make Americans sick which they have been doing for many years. Our federal government is also a part of the problem by subsidizing farmers to grow crops that are also not healthy for us. Then many people get sick and the government subsidizes big pharmaceuticals to make drugs to fix the problems that they created in this vicious circle. So now we see commercials for pills intended to fix one health issue but cause more problems. Now the government has to pay for big health care bills. Americans have the poorest health on the planet, wake up people. Stop poisoning yourselves!"
4,Thatgirl220,"I love this app. It has helped me tremendously in making good choices about what I buy, especially being plant-based. My only complaint is when I need to add a product. The app wants me to take a picture of the nutrition label as well as the ingredients. Not all boxes and labels look the same and when I go to take a picture the app creates a little square where you are supposed to fit the labels in. The bad part is sometimes the square doesn‚Äôt recognize the actual size of the list of ingredients or the nutrition label. You can‚Äôt change the square or adjust the photo so 9 times out of 10 I can‚Äôt get an accurate picture. It‚Äôs just a portion of the actual label. Super frustrating when trying to add new products. Outside of that, I love the app. Hopefully that makes sense and somehow can be fixed in the future."
5,ffhingsyibjodhj,"overall i‚Äôm very happy with this app so far. i do wish they would rate things like alcohol and cbd beverages instead of just shaming you for drinking alcohol (even though cbd drinks don‚Äôt contain any). since the most horrible for you foods and drinks are on here it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add those too. also it would probably be more effective in curbing people‚Äôs consumption to show their rating instead of just saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt rate those, you know what you‚Äôre doing‚Äù.  but like i said overall im very happy. our family has made a lot of changes to the products we use and the things we eat, even though we thought we were being good about it prior. truly scary to see the products out there advertised as ‚Äúall natural‚Äù and supposedly good for you."
5,Lrounds,"This app is awesome! The rating system is very informative, the scan procedure has been flawless, the search works well, and so far I‚Äôve found 99% of what I‚Äôve looked for. Probably my favorite part is the recommendations. So far they seem to be things I can easily find in my local grocery store and things I probably would enjoy just as much as my original. The only flaw I‚Äôve found is this review section. It is very slow to come up on my iPhone and if I make a mistake and use the spacebar to get to it, the keyboard disappears. The only way I‚Äôve found for it to come back is to minimize the window then go back in. Keyboard pops right up. I like this app so much, I paid for the Premium version right away. Thanks for a great eating lifestyle fixing app!"
4,HerbalLiving,"I really like this app and I think it‚Äôs a wonderful tool for people like myself, who are trying to be more cognizant about products that we are putting in and on our body. My recommendations to make this app even better is to add ‚ÄúFragrance‚Äù into scoring, as we know that there could be many different chemicals under the label ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù. I think this app could be a lot more informative too by being able to click on all the ingredients and not just some. Although they may not be harmful, it would still be nice to know what they are. I also have found many products that I was unable to search or scan. Maybe make it so you can request a score for a product that isn‚Äôt listed? Like I said above, I thoroughly like this app and really like how it gives recommendations and alternatives."
4,Zoeee269,"I have been using Yuka for 3 years now and it has completely changed how I shop. It makes it less overwhelming at the grocery store and I scan everything I can but it has both its pros and cons.   Pros: free (and without ads), fast, simple, scores most food, drinks, and beauty products from the store, comprehensive scoring system (nutritional content, additives, and organic content), includes descriptions of the additives along with the scientific sources if they are limited or high risk, provides recommendations for similar products with better scores, and the new feature to call out the brands is pretty cool.   Cons: does not rate supplements, does not lower the score if a product contains seed and vegetable oils even though there is research that supports they are harmful to us, and it‚Äôs not 100% accurate (I have found many additives that they list as ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù such as soy lecithin that are in-fact risky).   In conclusion: definitely use this app on everything you can buy but if the product has seed/vegetable oils and has additives that are unfamiliar to you that are listed as no risk or limited risk, do your own research on it and try to find similar products without the additives."
1,Ace1163945,"Wife has been using this for a while and swears by it. However I find the information to be inaccurate. Take for example ‚ÄúSmakin Sunflower Seeds‚Äù OG version. I scanned them and it said they were too salty at 70mg of sodium when on the package it says there‚Äôs 0mg. So I proceed to update the nutritional information in the app. I scanned the info on the back of the package only to bring me to another page that has more of the values prefilled in ‚Äúbut can be changed‚Äù. Why would you allow it to be changed? Additionally 4 of the values weren‚Äôt prefilled in, total fat, saturated fat, carbs and protein. The package says it has 17g of fat but the app gave me an error when I tried to enter that amount. It told me that the amount needed to be less than 15g. Why? Anyways I selected 15g since it was the closest. I proceed to enter the saturated fat and carbs, when I go to enter the protein, I get an error that says that all the values I entered have to less than 16g. Again why? This is why I do not trust this app."
5,Beth's WW,"I heard about Yuka a few years ago and got the app. What a brilliant, helpful app it is! Since then, my husband and I use it every time we go to the grocery store, and also when I buy shampoo, sunscreen, or cosmetics. I don‚Äôt buy anything without scanning it on Yuka first.  It is incredibly helpful and instrumental in making the healthiest and safest choices.  I love that if the product that I scanned doesn‚Äôt rate well, that Yuka gives alternatives for better options! I also love that it gives specifics as to to positives and negatives for each product. Yuka makes such a positive, difference in assisting people in making the healthy and safe choices. Kudos to the creators of this amazing app. You truly are making the world a better place!! Thank you so much!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Fibro warrior/TV binge watcher,"I have pretty much relied on Yuka to help me clean up most of my food and beauty products. Honestly if I didn‚Äôt have Yuka, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have lasted as long as I have on bettering my health and my weight loss journey. I love it so much that I payed for the upgrade. It taught me what nitrates and sulfates were and the effects that they have. Before Yuka, I would never think twice about petroleum and parabens. I have read so many warnings, that I feel like if I didn‚Äôt have the app, I would be ok because I can pick out the really ‚Äúbad‚Äù additives.  Well, it looks like I might have to, because I just did the update and all the additive warnings are gone and it only has the ingredients now?! I sure hope there‚Äôs a fix in the works, because I am gonna miss this app!"
5,Seachelle124,I‚Äôve never cared enough about an app to take the time to rate it. I love this app. It‚Äôs a fantastic tool to have in my pocket. A friend told me about it and I downloaded it as soon as I got home. I scanned so many things that I use and was absolutely shocked on some. I now check product barcodes at the store so I know if it‚Äôs a good buy or not. I had been questioning my bargain shampoo lately because my hair was coming out like crazy. Yea..  it rated terribly. I love the suggestions because it recommends products I may have never even thought of before. Thank you so much for this app. I know I will have a healthier life because of it. Yuka takes the guesswork &/or research out completely and gives you exactly what you need to know in less than a second.
5,Baby517Blue,"I FREAKIN LOVE THIS APP!!!!!! üòçüòçüòç I have been using it for 2 years and it is absolutely worth having. I have been able to find products that are better for my child and me. I have definitely made better choices in selecting products that‚Äôs are just overall safe. I love the recommendations feature. The only thing I would advise is maybe adding a feature where if there isn‚Äôt a product available on the app that we can somehow add the product and include it‚Äôs ingredients. And it generating a report then and there. I could‚Äôve sworn I seen the feature a while back. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still there or if it was ever there but it would helpful. And if it‚Äôs there then how do I use it? Anyways people, you‚Äôll be happy with this app."
5,GodofGuitar555,"It truly is a terrific app that‚Äôs helping me make slightly better decisions. I‚Äôve noticed with myself, I‚Äôm not super worried about the nutritional/macro breakdown, but I‚Äôm big time into knowing what kind of food chemicals/preservatives are in the stuff I‚Äôm eating/using daily. Even my daily lotion had some red flags. Ignorance is bliss but knowledge is power and if feeling bliss means putting yourself at higher risk, then no thanks. I will say I‚Äôm starting to hear more and more about how awful seed/vegetable oils are for our health and so far, this app has no acknowledgment of that. So that would potentially be something I would like to be taken into consideration at some point down the road but overall, keep up the good work and keep up the human health empowermentü§ô"
5,alexia.sunflower,"It is such an awesome app! It‚Äôs almost completely free unless you want the extra options of allergy‚Äôs and things like that, or vegan and vegetarian things. You can still scan those but it won‚Äôt tell you if each product is vegan and all that unless you look at the actual product of that makes sense. Even if you did want that you can pay as little as $8.99 for a WHOLE YEAR! If your allergies aren‚Äôt listed you can even request them to add it! It shows you recommendations for food thats rated bad (a better option) it‚Äôs just one of the best apps I‚Äôve gotten, I use it pretty much every day, it really surprises you to see what we put in our bodies, especially sunscreens and things like that, that are supposed to be good for us!"
5,Lybber8ter,"I‚Äôve always tried to be careful with food purchases. I cook from scratch, bake bread from grains I grind, garden, etc. We raised our kids this way. This app took me to the next level, especially for health and beauty products. I‚Äôve learned that trusted health companies can have good and not so good products and I had no way of knowing this before the Yuka app. Some generic companies (cheaper brands) have specific products that rate very high, too! I‚Äôve enjoyed conversations while shopping with customers and store employees when they ask what I‚Äôm checking. Everyone has such a positive response and many download the app while we are talking. We love this app and my husband checks items, too!"
5,Adoremus in Aeternum,"I was introduced to this app about a month ago, while shopping at Sam‚Äôs. A customer was scanning food, and showed the app to another lady and myself. The other lady and myself did not know each other, but we were all through the store, scanning everything like crazy women and laughing.  I have Since moved the icon to my home button and I use this app probably 10 times a day. I have thrown out food from my cabinets and I have bought food based on the incredibly helpful information. You will get scientific details as to why something is bad for you, like I did not know that blue food dye causes DNA/ cellular damage.  My husband was just diagnosed with heart failure so now I have another tool to help me make the best decisions for him.  THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS! üíúüíúüíú"
5,Barbara Prior,"I love this app! I have had it for a few days and it has already changed my life! It is so easy to use ,and it is straight to the point! I have wanted to get all of the hazards additives from food and cosmetics out of my life, and now I can! I have suffered for many years in pain and know,  that the additives in everything has made it so much worse. I am so excited to see the difference in me! When I have gone food shopping  this week, I spoken to so many people about this app also my friends and family they all love it and they all downloaded the app!  I have never been so excited about an app I became a member today and will stay a member forever! Thank you so much for creating this app it will change the way we shop forever!"
5,Ramsey-Salah,"What an amazing app! With a pay what you think is fair model for a premium membership this app is simply genius. This app provides quick and easily accessible information for facts about nutrition and what you may be eating or what you‚Äôre going to eat. It‚Äôs a great app to go to the store with to be conscious about what you may be eating or putting into your body. I really like how there is a scale to measure things that may be an issue if consumed in large portions. I enjoy the additives feature that tells you what additives are safe or what is dangerous. I also really enjoy being able to see the amount of protein in things i may be eating in a simple format and something that is easily readable. Thank you, Yuka developers for creating such an amazing app."
5,RidaEl,"Hey there! I just wanted to share my thoughts on this amazing app that I've been using lately. It's been a game-changer for me, especially the recommendations feature that helps me discover the healthiest food options. I feel like I'm making better choices for my health and overall well-being, which is fantastic!   However, there's one thing that's been on my mind. I really hope that this company stays true to its mission of helping people and doesn't compromise on its values. You know what I mean? I wouldn't want to see big brands influencing the recommendations on the app. It's important that we can trust Yuka to provide unbiased information, and not just recommend products because they've been paid to do so."
3,teddycapitalist,"This app is good with probably 70% of all products. My problem is with the other 30%. Sometimes when you scan or search an item, it doesn‚Äôt read all the ingredients listed on the label. I‚Äôve found this to be too common with a lot of different products. I‚Äôve gone on to use certain products that actually had harmful ingredients in them but since the app didn‚Äôt read that it had those particular ingredients, it gave it a high rating and I blindly bought those items. Through the usage of this app, however, I‚Äôve become familiar with a lot of different ingredients that are harmful and so I‚Äôm able to double check the products I buy just in case Yuka does not read certain ingredients. I‚Äôm just saying, it would be nice if it worked 100% of the time. Besides that, I really do love this app."
2,N2MDesigns,"I would appreciate if you work with doctors like dr Gundry, dr Peter Osborne, dr Jockers,  a lot of wholelistic medical practitioners. I would also like if you expanded your products to more items that are sold at sprouts and Whole Foods.. the reason I‚Äôm not so happy with the current app is because the rating is a little confusing because some doctors say fat is not bad and that is you change your diet to eat more natural things that some added sodium isn‚Äôt bad and other things. So I‚Äôm conflicted with the opinion of the and the information that doctors are talking about in thier books and they provide facts and research to back up thier claims so the app can be confusing. I hope the app will add a ability to categorize items and create separate list. Also a profile to edit and share on social media. So hopefully they consider more information and expand so I can come back and edit my review to more stars."
5,Everything E1se Was t@ken,obviously you have to do you're own critical thinking when it comes to a food product. It will score something lower just because of calories or sugar content etc.. If the SUGAR IS NATURAL that shouldn‚Äôt mater. Its the added sugars that aren‚Äôt cane sugar that is concerning. Just don't put something down if this app says its not 100. I mostly use this app to quickly find bad ingredients. So i give it a 3 star because this app gives a low score on perfectly healthy food. Maybe‚Ä¶  Edit: thank you for the response‚Ä¶ i see there is a user base that also could do some heavy lifting for you guys especially in the US.. keep up the good work because we in the US are being poisoned daily and this app is great fro finding bad things fast at the store
5,Bob Hannon,"maligatormomtx‚Äôs review below illustrates a very strong point about Yuka needing to make the distinction between sugar and high fructose corn syrup. I suspect this independent development team (that‚Äôs only 11 people strong btw) will get around to making that improvement. It‚Äôs a young app. I give it 5 stars without a doubt. We have needed a tool like this for a long time. The fact that they‚Äôre dedicated to maintaining their independence is commendable and beautiful to see. It would also ruin the app‚Äôs integrity any other way since the whole app is predicated on objective data and trust. The point is: it‚Äôs awesome. Download it to find out. It can get better, and I believe it will. You should buy a premium membership. Please make it a priority and tell your friends."
5,Megannoel27,"I recommend this app to all my friends and family!! This app has been so eye opening to all the horrible ingredients hidden in every day products. It has been so helpful in finding alternatives to unsafe products. If the government isn‚Äôt going to put a ban on these toxins being allowed in things we put in and on our body then it is up to us, sadly. But fortunately for us, we have this amazing app that makes it so easy to find clean and healthy products.   If you‚Äôre on the fence of the paid version, I say do it! I did free for awhile and it was definitely beneficial, but being able to actually type in and search products from home is way more convenient than having to be at the store to scan it."
5,arrowheadpoet,"I found this app after blood work and Dr visits and SO MANY supplements trying to resolve simply ‚Äònot feeling good‚Äô. Even though everything comes back fine, I don‚Äôt FEEL fine. Then I found Yuka!!! I learned the personal care items I was buying were BAD, and POOR‚Ä¶. One or two were GOOD or EXCELLENT. Wow, my eyes were opened! I‚Äôm in the process of replacing the garbage with healthier things- and I thought I was buying healthy things!!!! This app is changing my HEALTH. Get it, share it, USE it. It‚Äôs amazing. It tells you what‚Äôs in the product, rates it as safe or unsafe, gives you alternative options for better products- it‚Äôs all you need! Scans the barcode and you know right there in the store if that product is coming home with you or not!"
5,Cynical shopper,"I never write reviews.  But this fantastic app deserves more than a 5-star rating.  It has given me back so much time in stores checking on ingredients.  It has also granted me the certainty of using science to cut through the marketing hype and, frankly, the lies and distortions on many product labels.  I love how it refers to EU regulatory standards given how weak or non-existent US standards are on skincare ingredients.  I‚Äôve thrown out heaps of dubious products, cleaned out my cabinets, and started fresh with this app.  And it helps so much when a well-meaning but clueless store rep tells you a brand is ‚Äúclean.‚Äù  You can check that claim easily and immediately, and find out how often those sales reps are dead wrong.  Wonderful app. Grateful!  Thank you, Yuka"
5,azLaura99,"** update I super love the ""callout"" feature!!  thank you thank you thank you for giving us the ability to make our voices heard on these terrible things that they're putting in our food!!    The catchphrase in my family now is ‚Äúis it Yuka approved?‚Äù My daughter-in-law, stopped getting migraines when she changed over her diet, getting rid of these additives that they put in our food. My son has lost weight and my grandchildren who are autistic, their speech is getting better. Therapist has noticed a huge improvement. All of that aside, the app is easy to use. You understand what you‚Äôre getting in your food and cosmetics, and you‚Äôre able to make an intelligent choice based on the facts."
5,Bunnysmth,Yuka has been a life saver if it wasn‚Äôt for the app I would have been eating horribly for a very long time. As soon as I scanned my favorite ice cream it turned out that the ice cream I was eating had food that could make you very sick in the future. Right after I got this app I decided to scan almost every type of food in the house also it turned out that my favorite Mac and cheese also had something that could make you very sick in the future. Another I love about this app is that whatever food you scan that is bad or poor will give you something that similar to that food but much better in ingredients.        After you saw this review I hope you download the Yuka app and start eating better.
5,dcuellar44,This is exactly what I was looking for. After having been diagnosed with cancer I decided I would make changes to my diet. I‚Äôve done some research about what I should avoid but it was always difficult to remember it all when you have limited time in a store shopping for groceries. This app made it much easier to keep track of and avoid foods I feed myself and my family.   I will not shop without it anymore. Hopefully others start being more conscious as well so businesses start to take our health more seriously. It‚Äôs dollars over people right now so this is how we combat them. Stop buying products that poison you. Make them make products you will buy. Healthy products.
5,Lolo24245,"This app is life changing and I don‚Äôt say that lightly. I‚Äôve been using it for the past two years and it‚Äôs very user friendly and having the ability to add items or products to get rated is super cool. The ability to scan barcodes is great. I first started using this for beauty related items and had no idea that there are such horrible ingredients in cosmetics that are carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, pollutants etc.  This had made me a more conscious consumer and more aware of the products I was using are bad for me and my health. Many products that you think are ‚Äòclean‚Äô are actually not and still have ingredients in them that are harmful. I tell anyone I can about this app and did contribute money because I believe in what Yuka is doing.   With more awareness about what we are consuming and products we are using, we can shift our purchasing power to the brands and companies making products that are not harmful and hopefully then change the entire landscape of products to not including ingredients that are harmful, and everyone will be better off!  I cannot say enough good things about this app and this company!"
4,T√∏p fanatic,"I work in a beauty supply shop and saw customers in the isles using this app, and decided to finally give it a shot about a month ago after seeing it all over my Instagram reels, and I definitely will say this is a useful app. A lot of the cosmetics I'd been using were full of harmful chemicals, and thanks to the recommendations I was able to find replacement products. I will say some of the time the recommendations aren't even the same as the product scanned, like I've scanned heat protectant and the recommended products were hairsprays. But over all I definitely recommend this app! It gives you the opportunity to learn what all of those ingredients on the label really mean instead of just skipping over it and using a product not knowing any negative effects it could have."
2,mynickname443,"This app is incredibly good and wildly useful and deserves not 5 but 10 stars, but if you move to another country it is very likely not available in that region‚Äôs app store. You will not be able to subscribe and support Yuka (which I have been so happy to do), and you will not be able to update your app. I am devastated. As a parent of a small child, this app has been my absolute favorite, and now I am very upset that I won‚Äôt be able to use the app much longer because of this needless region-based availability limitation. As impressive the work is that the Yuka team puts out, I can‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt do what so many other apps have done and make the app available everywhere or nearly everywhere. A true loss to millions of families and parents and children who deserve to grow up in the healthier world that Yuka makes much more easier to provide."
5,azuregirl,"I‚Äôve never reviewed any apps, but this one is incredible. As someone on a nontoxic journey to rid my house of carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, allergens and irritants in my beauty, health and home products, this app has guided me to the actual cleanest products available which lack toxic ingredients. I like how I can view items by rating and learn about each ingredient and mark favorites. I love scanning products on the shelf so I can shop in person and make educated purchases. This is a must have app for anyone that cares about their health and the wellness of their family. It will change your life. I don‚Äôt use it for the food aspect but that‚Äôs a great tool too. Definitely upgrade to the Premium version, it‚Äôs well worth it!"
5,Edgar Allan Crow,"I‚Äôm not even kidding when I say this app changed and potentially saved my life. Since I learned about the insane amount of chemicals and toxins being used in beauty products and foods, I immediately downloaded this app so I knew exactly what I was using on my body and consuming. Now I‚Äôve never been healthier, and the app is already so useful without the premium subscription. It gives me recommendations to use instead of other harmful products, and it has a history tab so I never lose track of all the foods and beauty/self care products I‚Äôve read about. Like I said, amazing app. I‚Äôve already had 5 different friends of mine download it and love it. I‚Äôve never felt safer about what I‚Äôm buying until now."
5,ICGXO,"I see all these review that say nothing but bad thing about the Yuka app but I have to disagree with them, I have looked everywhere to find something wrong and I could not find a single thing wrong, what I did find is that this is by far one of the best apps of all time. If you care about your health from what you eat to what you put on your body then this is that app for you. The app is free to use but if you want a membership it is very affordable and it‚Äôs for a whole year!!!! I have change my whole life style because of this app and I have to saw I have lost much needed weight and I feel better then ever because of what I eat now. So I hope you give Yuka a change I bet you will feel a lot better"
5,Jay_the_homosapien,"This app is honestly a miracle. I‚Äôm frequently guilty of buying things without thinking twice, and Yuka helps me control that impulse because often the things that I‚Äôm wanting to impulse buy are the worst for me by far, and by ensuring I look twice I‚Äôve been able to spend a lot less on things I don‚Äôt need. I appreciate that you don‚Äôt have to pay to use almost all of its services, and that you can adjust your subscription price. Nothing about the apps framework feels nefarious or like they‚Äôre trying to extort you, the only thing in mind seems to be ease of use for the end user. Yuka is a gem, and I applaud the scientists and innovators who put aside their time to make it!"
5,Optimum Health,"When I first heard of the Yuka app, I downloaded it, scanned many cosmetics and foods that we had in our household, and was alarmed at how much toxicity exists in these products. The first day I used it I threw away at least $100 worth of facial creams, skin, creams shampoos and  deodorants.  My whole family uses it when food shopping and we only buy foods that do not contain hazardous ingredients and that score high on the app.  We also like the recommendations that the app provides. We have passed the knowledge of the app onto our friends and neighbors and even shared  it with some fellow shoppers when appropriate.  Fantastic app that will positively influence manufacturers to eliminate harmful ingredients or suffer a permanent loss in the sale of their harmful products."
5,dibemfoan,"You MUST try this app. Even though there are a limited number of allergies included at this time, the potential is enormous. Even just scanning things quickly to see whether or not they have gluten in them has been a huge timesaver. But what is even better, is that the app provides multiple recommendations for alternatives. For anyone that has had to go on food elimination diet to figure out what they are sensitive to, you know how frustrating is to only eliminate foods and cosmetics with zero help to find alternatives. This app changes that! Please give it a try, and hopefully as more people use the app, the developers will be able to add additional sensitivities and allergens to the list."
3,biscuitflyer,"I took two stars away because it doesn‚Äôt have more concern for environmental impacts  as well as  chemicals.   To me that‚Äôs just as important as hazardous additives.  So I take the ratings as a Base. Then decide by doing my own research.  While almond milk for example is rated as an excellent choice , the production and farming aspects  aren‚Äôt. Almonds take much more water than other grains or even watering cows. Also. The flowers from almond trees are deadly to bees which we know are essential to any plant survival.  So to rate milk as equal to plant based such as oat or pea milk is ultimately a disservice.   Because milk isn‚Äôt as society friendly as advertised.  Cafo  animals are not the best thing for anyone or the planet.  I just think there‚Äôs room for improvement here.     I‚Äôm interested in the best choice I can make overall. Rather just additive  conscious"
4,Ryro8,"Currently, I am on chemotherapy pills after a double mastectomy for breast cancer. I‚Äôve been using Yuka to rid my home of bad products and it‚Äôs mostly been helpful. But here‚Äôs the problem, I‚Äôm finding tons of discrepancies. One example, take Oatsome regular and Oatsome barista. They both have the same serving size, same sugar content, same everything, except barista version has a little more fat and ups the calories by 40 per serving. But yet it‚Äôs poorly rated and the regular is an excellent rating.      Also, when ridding my home of all these bad products, I‚Äôm searching for healthier options, which the app suggests. But it would be so much easier for me (and more profitable for the app) if they would provide a link to purchase the healthier option! Why not do that?"
5,Blovesr143,"I‚Äôve been wanting to look into every ingredient that‚Äôs in everything I have been eating and feeding my family, but realistically that‚Äôs impossible. I am so relieved this app was made! It is so user friendly, straight forward and they really make it easy for you to understand. No more guessing what these crazy ingredients are! This app really breaks it down for you and I absolutely love that they give recommendations on other similar products that are way healthier for you. This app changed the way I look at food and beauty products and puts my mind at ease knowing that I‚Äôm no longer hurting myself and my family with harmful ingredients that I had no idea were even harming us!"
5,Lanabeautiful,"I found out about Yuca in a comment on Instagram. The moment I downloaded I started scanning everything in my householdüòÑ Got rid of half of my food in the pantry, some I was surprised to find out they are actually good with no additives and that‚Äôs what I most look for, additives. I don‚Äôt care for high fat and salt content as I do Keto. I go around the grocery aisles scanning every single product, many I used to like,  once you see what they put in it there is no way you will put that in your body. I told all my friends about Yuca and will keep telling everyone. I think you guys are awesome and are helping a lot of people. I will subscribe too and will be waiting for your ratings on alcoholic beverages üç∑Thank you!"
1,Bernadette Marbach,"PLEASE people I am begging you, do not download this. The basis of this app seemed to be confusing to me because I did not understand how they were ascribing these ‚Äúscores‚Äù to food products. I looked on the website and found that they use a nutritionist who is French to review their sources. I have not been able to find any related education, and I know that the term nutritionist is not regulated in the US. Registered dietitians is the only term that can be regulated.I went ahead and downloaded the app, and found that many of the articles that are sourced from companies and organizations with bias. And they claim not to have bias? So that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Many of the articles had even been taken down, and some were not even peer reviewed.. So please take this information with a grain of salt. The demonization of preservatives and processed foods for no reason needs to stop, especially when they are causing people to have unhealthy relationships with food."
5,GREENDRAGONCO,"Yuka‚Äôs App is an Amazing Asset & Tool for Conscientious Consumers in Today‚Äôs Globally Collapsing Food Market!! Monsantos and Others are Poisoning Humanity with Cheap, Man Made Ingredients in our food and Yuka‚Äôs Hard Working Team has Empowered us with the INFO we need to make Smart Decisions when buying food or topicals. Completely INDEPENDENT which means they say NO to Corporate Bribes and Gifting people so they say Yes. I Highly Recommend the Annual Subscription that isn‚Äôt a Monthly payment, but rather a 1 time Contribution of anything from $10-$20 dollars or Any amount you want to give to show your support for this Incredibly Helpful Information by Yuka. I LOVE IT!! Thanks to the Amazing Women and Men keeping this engine going for the people of the World. Cheers to Staying Healthy!!"
1,skyemars,"I really wanted this app to be reliable, and I have a paid subscription, but sadly I find many errors in it: missing ingredients, duplicated products with different ratings... And when I report an error they ask me to provide the information, to take the picture of the ingredients, etc. I pay a subscription. I don‚Äôt work for free. They should be the ones checking the products and finding the correct information. Plus the product pictures look really bad. The idea behind it is good, but I don‚Äôt find it too reliable. ‚Äî‚Äî- Thank you for your reply. It sounds great, but as I said I often find the same product with different ratings listed more than once, products with not all ingredients listed and it is very disappointing specially when you pay for the app. So the idea is good but it needs lots of improvements or more people hired to keep the app up to date."
5,Dhrncgtdb,I have been using Yuka for about 3 weeks now and I love it! The fact that it can scan almost any food and beauty product makes it incredibly handy! If there is one thing I would add it would be a breakdown of stores selling the item or the average price of the item that way I wouldn‚Äôt have to go out of the app in order to find what places have said item because some stores don‚Äôt have the items that are recommended I‚Äôm not sure if it is the area I live in or not but it would be helpful nonetheless. Overall a great app I would highly recommend to anyone looking to understand more about what‚Äôs in consumables and beauty products alike!
5,molly canabisera,"I use this app for almost everything. Any cosmetic or skincare/bathroom product I purchase I pull up the scanner and with no effort at all i can see the ingredients and cleanliness rating of the product. I am so grateful for this app. there are so many harmful chemicals in daily items that aren‚Äôt disclosed or understood and if you value the cleanliness and natural aspect to your routine like i do, this is so amazing. instead of having to do a bunch of research or take my chances I can feel confident knowing i have this resource in my pocket. it works in certain food and cleaning products as well. I truly love this app, and if there more you need they have a premium version to subscribe to with a sliding pay scale."
5,Cpopovits08,"Everyone should have this app!!!! I‚Äôve always been interested in changing out any daily items that have harmful chemicals or preservatives in them, but I never knew where to start. Yuka has made that process exceedingly smooth.  I started using this free app 2 months ago and it‚Äôs changed my outlook on what I put in and on my body and skin. The ability to scan while food or beauty shopping is such a game changer.  Although the app is free I upgraded to the paid version so I can search instead of just scanning items - you choose how much you want to pay. I hope they receive the continual support they deserve and keep growing and expanding this amazing app!"
5,srb987,"I have been dreaming about having an app like this for years! It‚Äôs so helpful and as I run out of products, I use this app to help me pick out a healthier one. Hopefully, working my way to eventually have no more toxins in our house. It can be so overwhelming with all the greenwashing companies do nowadays so I appreciate this app so much!  One thing would be nice if you could indicate what country the product is from or if you could filter out products from your country that you want to see.  Sometimes the same product will be in the app twice because in the US version is bad, and the European version is good, but we can‚Äôt tell which is which."
4,kaylaaltuz,"I love this app and I love the section for beauty products! The rating system is great. The one thing that I don‚Äôt like however, is the lack of settings on the food side. I don‚Äôt like seeing that some of the foods I eat are ‚Äúpoor‚Äù simply because the app thinks they are too high in calories. I didn‚Äôt download this app for calories I downloaded it to check for harmful additives. I just wish there was a setting to turn off the calorie rating and the sugar rating. There‚Äôs no reason my organic coffee creamer is a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù food for having 6g of sugar in a tablespoon. I just want to know if there is additives. Maybe something to consider with the next update? Otherwise keep up the good work! I plan on keeping my premium membership active."
5,PerfectDark023,"Was looking everywhere for a free app or website like this that tells you in real time if something is good or bad for you, and tells you exactly what's bad in said product and why.   Since the FDA is allowing food companies to put chemicals in our food and not telling us directly what's bad about it, why not see exactly whats in my food myself and be told exactly what's bad about it.  If insects and wild animals are not eating the food, if the food doesn't become rotten and still looks the exact same a month later, if the same ingredients are banned in other countries with their identical product, why are we being allowed it eat it then?"
5,Christinared05,"As a parent and an individual i am always hearing or reading something bad about a product i thought was good and am left with complete uncertainty about EVERYTHING!  I just want to buy something and KNOW it‚Äôs safe. Especially when it comes to my children. I don‚Äôt know what each chemical is and/or if it‚Äôs harmful, so thank you for doing the work for me. I‚Äôm able to scan products in the store ‚Äúbefore buying them‚Äù and get a rating 0/100 if harmful and a list of healthier alternatives.  I love that your not funded or supported by any of the companies selling the products.  I highly recommend this app to everyone and have my entire family using it."
5,Evpraxia,"I had been very happy with Yuka for checking on foods, but had almost forgotten it can also check on skin care products. Yuka is a Tremendous help on skin care products and I found the products that I needed.   I had researched rosacea skin care products using rosacea articles and reviews, thinking that was sufficient. I looked at the ingredient list of one product in particular and found it had some hazardous preservatives. Checked this product with Yuka and Yuka confirmed my judgment of the product. I have now spent approximately 2 hours at various stores picking up a product, scanning it and putting the product back on the shelf. Found what I needed!!!"
5,fdd si gh,"As adults we truly get away with using any and every product we see marketed as ‚Äúhealthy, clean, or natural etc‚Äù. We aren‚Äôt taught about the hazardous chemicals, and the market of products makes it no better than to have all those weirdly pronounce ingredients on the nutrition label. This application YUCA makes it easier to understand the ingredients we are putting into our bodies & hair. I know it‚Äôs inevitable to completely consume 100% 5 ingredients foods 24/7 but with YUCA my conscious feels more at ease with shopping for beauty or food products. Honestly it takes time to scan the barcodes but it‚Äôs more convenient than searching up every single ingredient. Definitely recommend."
5,takeout girl,"This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever had. I think I was waiting for something like this and when my sister told me about it, I went through my whole kitchen and bathroom and scanned everything I could find. What peace of mind to know we have people behind YUKA who care for our well being. A lot has gone downhill with the FDA and the U.S. food industry in general . Most of the organic companies have been bought out by big corporations, and the use of chemicals has increased drastically. To have an app like this, is so beneficial, it really hold the providers accountable and helps the consumer more. Also, they respond to emails so fast. Thank you to all those behind YUKA, you'all are gems! ü§ç"
5,Roses302,Thank you for creating such an important app guarding our health and safety.  The first day I used this in the supermarket I was amazed how much money I saved shopping as I put so many items back on the shelf. I don‚Äôt care to buy these food products that are unhealthy and dangerous. those companies are out to make a buck at our health expense. Most of us already are aware that this is tied into big Pharma. They Make us ill eating these foods so now we are on meds. Becomes a vicious cycle . I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt have these products in their homes. They should not be allowed to get away poisoning us.  Thanks again YUKA for making us aware!
5,Sweet nectar publishing,"I love that it recommends healthier options to poorly rated products and labels the products from bad to excellent that can be saved in a favorites folder for your reference later. I plan to shop only from my favorites list to keep me and my family healthy. Thank you so much for coming out with this app. Sometimes when I'm in the grocery store I see someone shopping for poorly rated items and feel compelled to tell them about the Yuka app. But, I don't want to offend anyone. It's just hard for me to know information that could help people and not be able to share. I have however told friends and family. Keep up the GREAT work Yuka family. I love you guys."
3,Rosey4444444999999998888,"I have a lot of products that don‚Äôt have a barcode or don‚Äôt show up when you search them. It‚Äôs very inconvenient when I want to know what‚Äôs in my product. I have different food or sauces from local stores that aren‚Äôt going to be on here. Or different cosmetics that were made specifically for my hair, that doesn‚Äôt have a barcode and also isn‚Äôt on here when you search it. It would be super nice if it would scan ingredients for you. Or tell you about a product based on the information you give it, without HAVING to have a barcode. Cause NOT ALL products HAVE a barcode. I can‚Äôt seem to find any information on so many of my products on any apps. So it would be so cool if Yuka could add some better features to their app."
5,Turbo nonsense ,"I‚Äôm not one for caring to much about apps but this one is a must to have. It has saved me from eating certain foods that I was lead to believe is good for me. You WILL be appalled on the hazardous chemicals companies put in everything food.  Since I had this app, I found out that 80% of the food I eat is harmful to my body and attitude!  Yes attitude! Many of the foods I scanned were known to cause ADD/ADHD and I‚Äôm feeling much better everyday. I feel like I‚Äôm sleeping better and I feel that I have more energy.  This is crazy!  I live in a country (USA)that will only ban something is it‚Äôs proven harmful. By then, it would be to late! This app will save you. I am a Yuka man now!  Thank you!"
5,hawkofku,"Customer service is responsive to feedback and is timely if you find anything that needs correction. Additionally, this app gives me the opportunity to quickly check barcodes for food preferences such as gluten free or soy free. It has opened my eyes to the secrets in our products that I never understood by looking at a label. It gives the actual research on why an ingredient or chemical is harmful. I‚Äôve replaced so many things from toothpaste and dermatologist recommended sunscreen to food choices. One of my favorite things is that it recommends a replacement for the potentially bad or poor rated thing you‚Äôve just scanned. I want to tell everyone to use this! Thank you, Yuka!"
5,Kyky872,"After hearing it recommended on social media, I decided to download Yuka to try it for myself. Honestly this app is a huge eye-opener!   Naturally, after I downloaded the app I went around my kitchen and bathroom scanning my food/makeup. I was horrified to learn that so many of the ""organic"" and ""cleaner"" options were just as bad, if not worse, than the regular products! (This would also explain a lot of my allergy issues!)   I like that it offers healthier alternatives that arw similar to what you were already using. Plus it's super comforting to know exactly what you're putting into your body. This is definitely something I would reccommend trying and keeping in your phone."
5,ü¶¥x ‚ôæ,"downloaded two similar apps before this one but neither were as good as this one. i am suspected of having some issues with my hormones so i have been scanning all hygiene products before i buy them and i find  that majority of them would‚Äôve messed with my hormones so it‚Äôs been extremely helpful. i have scanned a majority of my food products too and it‚Äôs been helpful to see where the issues in my diet come from. i actually ended up liking it so much i payed for the premium plan but i love that you don‚Äôt have to pay for the entire app to work, just a few features are unlocked with a donation. overall great app, thank you, Yuka."
5,Not a Uniquilo Shopper,"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this app. It is so well thought out from a very realistic perspective. Before being introduced to this app from an Ulta employee, I never realized how many  toxins were in the make up of various products. It is no wonder why cancer & other health issues are so prevalent. As a consumer with no scientific degree or medical knowledge this is such a User Friendly app that is not only comprehensive, but goes to the next level of recommending better products or food items & then is also gives you a history of what items you have scanned for your own personal reference.  I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about YUKA!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Gator 798 Pipeliner,"As a father making sure food is on the table , I want to make sure it is healthy with out all the crap that our country has done for the profit of a dollar as things to make shelve life last longer with this app you have a in site to what you feed yourself and family . When was the last time you seen bread mold?!  Likewise because of what‚Äô is being added and it is not heathy   Try this app and add it to yourself and find your own happiness. Live with Non gmo so worth your children future this app will also give you a view of what could be better for your family .  I like it I use it and it works."
5,Samioliphant,"I love love love YUKA! I have always been health conscious, but with all the new additives and secret ingredients in food, it‚Äôs hard to just grab and go when you‚Äôre at the store. Especially because a lot of things marketed as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or ‚Äúorganic‚Äùare just secretly horrible for you. I use YUKA RELIGIOUSLY when I‚Äôm shopping so that I‚Äôm making better choices with what goes into my body. I don‚Äôt go by just the rating but I click on what‚Äôs a concern and go through the things listed and because of YUKA I‚Äôve educated myself so much on food ingredients. I‚Äôve also put items back and grabbed healthier alternatives instead. Thank you for creating this app! It‚Äôs been life changing!"
5,Got Red,I love that it can tell me the truth of what is in my cosmetics and food.   I hate that most of my favorite foods are listed as poor or Bad. üò´  I spent the morning throwing out anything that did not get a50 or higher. I have to take baby step because I just can‚Äôt believe how put my choices in food have been. Make up products were even worse.   When it says poor or bad I click to find out why. If it is calories and I‚Äôm not over weight I keep it but will find something better. If it‚Äôs because of the sugar in the item I throw it out. I throw a ton of make up out today.   I want to make healthier choices for me and my family. My organic appetite scanned as poor. I was shocked. It has no added sugar. But it has high natural sugar. But my organic apple juice has added flavor??!!!!  How is it organic if they add flavor????    Every parent should shop using this app. Anyone with auto immune should shop with this.  I hope they add multi vitamins soon and spices. And I pray they do not accept sponsors. I would no longer trust the ratings
1,Youkelys,"The scoring method is totally wrong and misleading. The Nutri-Score method backed up by a WHO agency. After all the damage WHO did to the world in 2019, it has negative credibility in all they do. Back to the point, the scoring method weighted too much in sugar, saturated fat and sodium content, too simplistic approach that mislead people. Healthy food is way more than that and can‚Äôt be explained in a review like this. But, for example a high quality raw milk cheese got poor score just because is fatty by nature, without considering the quality of the milk, grass fed cows, GMO presence and other very important factors. People, get better educated, there is a lot to learn, and avoid relying in tools controlled by external sources. Developers, no need to reply to my review ‚ò∫Ô∏è, the app technically is great, just need to use a better scoring method which I understand is very hard and complex (I would say impossible) in today‚Äôs world. Thanks!"
5,denis biggest fan,"I can‚Äôt thank this app enough for helping me clean up the food and cosmetic products that my family uses. I hated not understanding and knowing what was in the products I used. Only having a limited understanding of what I should negate and keep away from my body. This not only helps me understand in an instant whether or not a product is good for me, but it provides me all the detailed information and scientific sources for why that‚Äôs the case. I love this app and would recommend it and HAVE recommended it to anybody I talk to! I hope that they go far and will support any movements they propose! Let‚Äôs clean our food up together!"
5,LiSh101wastaken,"I‚Äôve had this app for about a year now and I use it constantly, but I‚Äôve noticed lately, that some of the additives no longer have any description as to what their effects are. Some additives just show what they‚Äôre used for and what toxicity level they are(example: anti-caking agent, or antioxidant, flavor enhancer, etc..) but they‚Äôre hazardous, and at one point the app used to break down what was bad about them and their sources. Like, I know the additives being bad are enough to prevent me from buying the product, but there used to be a lot more information about what they are and why they‚Äôre harmful and I found that to be very useful."
5,i just want to load more,"I‚Äôve found myself being more cautious and aware of what I put in and on my body thanks to this app. It‚Äôs so rare that I spend any money on a mobile app, but the added features plus the low cost of a yearly premium membership encouraged me to become a member. No ads, too.   Only thing I wish was different was their evaluation of supplements (such as protein powder or electrolytes). It makes sense that they can‚Äôt evaluate it in the same way they do regular foods, but I do wish they would at least list the risky additives on such products. Regardless, I would recommend this app to anyone trying to be more conscious of their health."
5,grace2638,"I‚Äôm so sick of feeling like I need a chemistry degree to make informed, healthy choices for my family's beauty/health products! This app makes it so easy, describing each ingredient and even linking to scientific studies for further learning/evaluating whether I feel safe using a product. I went on a rampage through my bathroom cabinets and was shocked at how many potential carcinogens and endocrine disrupters there were, let alone chemical ingredients that were practically impossible to biodegrade. Into the trash they went. Love this app!  To the developers, PLEASE üôèüôèüôè add cleaning product reviews. You've made my life so much easier, and I want more! üòÇ"
2,AlwaysHitting8,"I think that scanning the barcode and seeing ingredients is great. I recommend everybody do so. However, the issue I have are the ratings for certain ingredients. For example, it claims artificial sweeteners are inherently harmful but in the context of someone who is trying to reduce their calorie intake, switching from a sugar sweetened beverage to a diet drink with an artificial sweetener can be an extremely lucrative tool. The fact that it‚Äôs listed as harmful in general in my opinion is misinformation simply because we don‚Äôt have good data to support that. In fact quite the opposite and when I emailed the company regarding this I never got a response. There‚Äôs more context involved when claiming ingredients are harmful or not. Many of the ‚Äúharmful‚Äù ingredients have no good data in humans to support it and would love to talk to the researchers for the app regarding this."
5,Ruenix,"Let me be honest on this review here. I am a person with not-so-great gut health, and have other underlying health issues. So for me, eating food is literally like playing minesweeper but on max difficulty, where the mines are severe cramping, the runs, etc. WHEN I TELL U this app is such a GAME CHANGER!?! It‚Äôs no lie. I don‚Äôt have to spend hours in store, combing over ingredients, dreading the possibility of missing something. I can just scan, and go. And it even offers healthier alternatives!!! (This was mind blowing to me). Seriously, God bless the developer of this app, because my health truly thanks you for itüôè  If you care about your health, get this app right now. Not even playing."
5,tavion1084,You know how surveys are always asking you if you‚Äôd recommend their product to a friend and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúno because I don‚Äôt have conversations regularly about ____‚Äù? Well Yuka is the opposite of that. I talk about Yuka app like I‚Äôm paid and sponsored by them (I‚Äôm not). I just genuinely love it that much and it is life changing. The things you think are healthy are not (and sometimes vice versa!).   One thing I‚Äôd change is a bit of customization because I don‚Äôt like having foods rated lower because they‚Äôre high calorie because everyone‚Äôs goals are different- if you‚Äôre gaining weight sometimes high calories is a good thing.
5,LINC@ROSIE,"I‚Äôm very health conscious, and felt I was making the right choices with certain foods in my cupboard.  After going through everything I found out that 20% of the items I had were NOT good.  I‚Äôm now that ‚Äúweird‚Äù person scanning barcodes at the grocery store and Costco.  I decided to show my husband some of his choices that he was making have not been good.  He asked me for the app which I thought was very funny.  I get a text from him from Costco, and he says‚Ä¶.‚ÄùI LOVE this app‚Äù.  He came home with way healthier choices than before, and he‚Äôs a difficult one to win over.  Thank you for all of your hard work, and educating me more."
5,BethanyHopee,"I‚Äôve been using this app to clean out my makeup routine. I‚Äôve spent too long loving ‚Äúluxury skincare‚Äù that turns out to not have your long term skincare interest. One of my only comments about the app is there are duplicates in the skincare, and they‚Äôll have two different ratings. They may be two different formulas, but it‚Äôs hard to tell, and some photos are evident that they're being added by users. One thing I LOVE is that they let you know on products when they‚Äôre about to change their formula. This is so important to stay in the know so your favorite company brand doesn‚Äôt switch to a cheaper alternative etc etc.  5 stars!"
5,Rozlynn070303,"I love this app. Whenever I go into stores in search of a new hair or body product I always use this app. It really opened my eyes to how many bad ingredients are in mainstream cosmetic brands! I think it is so helpful the list of why it is dangerous and why it is used in the product. They‚Äôve given a wide selection of alternative products you can choose from and even when they are curly hair specific products, they give curly hair specific alternative products. And the recommendations are usually inexpensive and easy to find in most stores. I have suggested and helped my whole family with this app. 100% recomend!!"
2,Erika Haines Zuckero,"Maybe because this is a new app, they haven‚Äôt had time to develop it fully, but I just scanned twenty different toxic-free products in my kitchen as well as other common household products (like WD40, for example) and they are not listed as products that have toxicity information on Yuka at all! They also do not have a lot of info on pet products, which makes me a little sad, as our four-legged friends are very important to us! I‚Äôm not deleting the app (or maybe I will) because it looks like they‚Äôre counting on me working for them (the ‚Äúpost information‚Äù link pops up when an unrecognized product is scanned) to keep their app functioning. It‚Äôs a good thing I know a lot about chemicals and what is and isn‚Äôt good for people, plants and animals‚Ä¶stay informed, everyone!  Cheers, Erika"
5,Inaudiblejoy,"I got this app because my brother‚Äôs wife uses it, and I had low expectations‚Ä¶ Needless to say this app is a 10/10, it‚Äôs ad free, subscription for a year ranges from 9-18, all do the same. This is just to support them, buts it worth it because, (like 0.75c a month? Yes please) it grants you ability to search up food items, and use the app without internet. Personally I don‚Äôt have cellular data so this is a win. My main bonus is its 2 million plus food items available, food items I never thought I‚Äôd find was on there, and the rating definitely matches how healthy and unhealthy the item is. Overall I‚Äôm super satisfied with this app!"
1,kannan,"So I tried this out on a product that I‚Äôve already done lots of research on in the past and know it‚Äôs very healthy with no junk/processed stuff in it. The app gave it a poor rating, with one of the reasons being high in sodium (only 190 mg per bar, which isn‚Äôt that much if you consider how much sodium you‚Äôll have in an entire day). The app then gave an alternative ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù suggestion. The ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù suggestion had 180 mg of sodium per bar (so basically the same thing as mine). The ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù suggestion also had sunflower oil and palm oil as ingredients, which are processed junk ingredients, whereas my product had nothing processed or artificial. My product also has more sugar, but it‚Äôs 100% natural sugar. The ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù product had a little less sugar, but it was mostly added sugar (huge difference). I‚Äôll stick to doing my own research."
5,AJY214,My brother turned me on to this as he himself couldn‚Äôt stop checking everything about the supermarket one day. I vouch it is addictive and helpful. Only issue I have is really a possible warning that it is really great at picking up codes from a distance. I found that as I moved my phone about the pantry ad it captured codes I already hit from 2 feet away. The app could use a pause. Since they design well and being ex IT I‚Äôd say it should have a share so I can send products to my brother or anyone so less scans needed. Sorry my French is too old to write this entire review in. C‚Äôest la vie. But anyone knows that. üòÅ. Great app!  Bon chance
5,Lilahhhhhcoy,"I downloaded this after seeing an ad for a different product scanner but after seeing the reviews on that one I decided to give Yuka a try. I am diagnosed with Hashimoto‚Äôs Thyroiditis which affects my body in every aspect from hair, skin, and nails to body function and hormones therefore, watching what I use and consume on a daily basis is important because certain ingredients in food and beauty products can cause a flare up or just completely throw my body out of its norm.  I also recommended this to my mom as she too has thyroid issues and by her response I can say she‚Äôs pretty excited about using this app.  Will edit if anything changes."
5,banjo playing hillbilly,I‚Äôm not one to write reviews a lot so if I do it‚Äôs either something is absolutely terrible or absolutely amazing. My boyfriend told me about this app and it took me a while before I downloaded it but now I use almost every time I go to the store. You can find products that are better for you. Face wash body washes and deodorants I have been using for years had terrible ratings when I scanned them. You do have to actually scan everything though. Like NATIVE for example their body wash and shampoo/ conditioners have good ratings but their deodorant is poor. Don‚Äôt assume just because a brand has one good item that they‚Äôll all be good.
5,AnnO Tate,"This app is such a gift‚Ä¶everyone I‚Äôve told about to, is so grateful (even though we are throwing out food and skin products by the bucketfuls). Once you‚Äôve awakened to the sad fact that food and cosmetics can be FDA approved, marked Organic, vegan, GF, etc‚Ä¶ and STILL contain harmful ingredients‚Ä¶I‚Äôm talking poisons, carcinogens, banned in other countries BAD‚Ä¶ it is imperative to have a vetting tool to make informed decisions‚Ä¶ I love that the app suggests viable alternatives to poor choices! I literally go shopping with my yuka app and scan like items until I get good or excellent choice..! My friends and I joke if something is bad=YUCKa or Good=YOUKa!!!  TY so much for this application and the plethora of information!!!"
5,SmithKristy,"YUKA has changed the way I shop for almost everything, especially the things I put ON my body-makeup, lotions, deodorants, soaps, shampoos etc. It's fascinating to scan a product I've used for years just trusting popular opinion only to find out it's the WORST thing I could be putting on my skin. Not only does YUKA tell me all the chemicals in a product but also alternatives to use instead. I've shared this with my circle and they too have been amazed. The app is so easy to use, it's quick and decisive. I'm thankful even at 53 years old it's never to late to make better choices for yourself."
5,jonwootang,"This is one of the best nutrition apps I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs straight forward and no gimmicks. It tells you if the food is good or bad and why. POINT BLANK! For a very easily distracted thinker as myself, Yuka removes the load of thoughts on why or why not i should eat or drink something. I love the fact that it said ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù. How easy is that? I‚Äôm sure my diet has gotten better simply by taking a few seconds to check the status of my food. I‚Äôve also been surprised to learn why some foods that i never thought were bad for me, were not so great and why. Thank you guys! I will be a long time user and would love to be an ambassador one day!"
2,Jls1727,"When we first got this app a year ago my wife and I used it religiously. Now we‚Äôve started to notice some strange inconsistencies regarding products that treat our 2 year olds eczema. I‚Äôll scan an item and it will show up as containing toxic ingredients but then I‚Äôll search the same product and it will show that it has no toxic ingredients. I need to do some research and figure out what the deal is with this app, where they get their information and who exactly is providing this information. The only reason I gave it such a low score was because I purchased and was using a product on my daughter for diaper rash that I‚Äôve recently found out has very toxic ingredients. When it comes to my child I take it very personally, this information should be very dependable."
5,PierceKyra,"This app is very convenient to use. If you‚Äôre looking for an app to easily see what additives may be added to products, then this is the app for you! I genuinely wasn‚Äôt really looking for this app. I had seen someone mention it on tiktok, and I have shared it with a few of my friends, and they enjoy it to. Side note:  I had some issues with the camera, and I emailed the YUKA team. The two people that got back to me were so helpful. I really appreciate that it didn‚Äôt take a long time to get the issue fixed. It took about a week (but part of that was me not responding because I didn‚Äôt see the emails that they sent.)"
5,Princess_loo133,"I cannot believe this app is free (for the most part), but for the information you can receive with it being free is OUTSTANDING. I enjoy this app and it has allowed me to make better decisions when it comes to what I am purchasing. It is impossible to know what every ingredient is and their risks, this app does it for you. I go on Google and search ‚Äúthe best facial moisturizer‚Äù and 10 websites will show different products. I can finally do my own searching and figure out what truly is a great moisturizer for my face and not having to rely on what a website with no background information tells me. Thank you."
5,LovelyChick,This app has changed my life for the better. I am the primary shopper for my family so I control what I bring into the house. I thought I purchased pretty well when it comes to food and personal care products but after I got this I was shocked! Small things such as body wash or condiments add up so once I started scanning everything in my house I ended up throwing about 25% of my food and beauty items out! I‚Äôve been telling my family and friends about this app. I‚Äôve been using it for almost a month and I physically and mentally feel so much better now that I eat better and use better products. Thank you Yuka!
5,not.eva,"This app is amazing. It has most food & cosmetic/hygienic products.  Since downloading it I‚Äôve gotten better deodorant, better snacks even better soap. & my skin has been improving!  I‚Äôm not gluten, vegan, vegetarian etc but I still purchased the subscription to help out because this app is simply amazing. I‚Äôve come across a few products that weren‚Äôt listed but that‚Äôs to happen because they can‚Äôt possibly have every single product ever made.   Only thing Im hoping for is they add the custom food preferences option soon because then I can recommend it to a lot of my family members & friends. They don‚Äôt care about quality but allergies & sensitivity‚Äôs they have are severe & for my mom who has tons of allergies like fish, lots of oils, nuts etc it will be so much easier & convenient for her to just scan items.   I still rate it 5 star because even if you can‚Äôt afford to pay the yearly subscription (which isn‚Äôt a lot) they still allowed the app to be accessible to anyone which I find generous."
4,Fxnn_y,I love how easy  it is to check products that I use on a daily to make better choices! In this day and age you really have to watch what you use because the regulations in the United States are sketchy. Long term use of certain products can cause disease and I personally am not interested in that.   The only issues for the app is the scan feature. Scanning could be more fluid. I do find myself having to select a different tab in order to get it to scan another item.   I would like to see this app expand to showing products such as high protein items and supplements. Since some items can be labeled ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù but in reality it isn‚Äôt.
4,drakengypsy,"This app had me super excited at first‚Ä¶ very user friendly and not swayed by big manufacturers! üôåüèº however I just recently realized that it does not recognize ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù as toxic or ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Ä¶ so tons of products like body washes, shampoos, lotions etc that contain synthetic fragrance (which if you‚Äôve done any research on this topic you‚Äôd know and agree you don‚Äôt want that blanket ingredient in anything you use!) are being shown as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or even ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù when ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù is not regulated and can be hiding thousands of different toxic chemicals‚Ä¶ I still give it 4 stars because it is very helpful when scanning food items! I hope they make a change with the way other products are scored though."
5,MakeupbyMichele,"This has been by far one of my favorite apps and probably most used since I downloaded it. I‚Äôve been recommending it to everyone I know! It‚Äôs so important to know what‚Äôs in our food without having to spend so much time researching and reading the back of boxes, when simply trying to go for a quick grocery run. This app cuts down my shopping time and makes me feel more at ease at what I‚Äôm purchasing and consuming. Love that there aren‚Äôt any advertisements and that brands cannot influence the ratings. I hope it stays this way!! If so, I will definitely continue to support."
3,Bob911911,"I absolutely love the idea of this app, and by now means do I want to completely derail its intent. However, as a nutritionist there are obvious flaws in it that I wish they would work on.   For example, a snack that consists of whole foods containing no additives will be considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù simply because it has 200 calories‚Ä¶ when 200 calories as a snack is the ideal amount for a healthy individual. We should not be demonizing foods because of their calorie count when we know it‚Äôs one‚Äôs total calorie intake for the day that matters in regards to their health and weight.   I would hate to see people, specifically younger kids, get the wrong idea and start to consider foods bad if they have 200 calories, when those 200 calories have vital nutrients and are made of healthy ingredients. Not to mention, most adults need anywhere between 1,500-2,200+. A 200 calorie snack is nothing to some individuals!  I guess my main take away is that we have to remember the big picture here. This app has great qualities, but it falls short on the individuals overall diet in terms of sugar/calories/sodium/etc, which is what truly matters for one‚Äôs health."
5,Kim4Jaga,"I have never put in a review for any App!  But, felt compelled to do so for this app, as it is a game changer!  As a consumer, it is a struggle to find safe products for my family and myself I can feel good using or consuming.  This is so straight forward, and easy to use.  Finally, I can easily compare products without standing in stores for hours, comparing labels, researching Google etc!  So many products I thought were safe, are actually terrible. (The US seriously has to start banning some awful ingredients!) I love everything so far!  I also love that it offers alternative products.  Truly, thank you to the creator (s)!!"
3,Smurfml,"I have tried some of the cosmetic products Yuka gives as alternatives to those labeled as scarce or mediocre.  They will certainly be excellent as regards the ingredients, but their effectiveness was very bad ... Another example concerns food: for example Parmigiano Reggiano, known for being the most natural cheese ever, with only 2 ingredients: milk and salt (no preservative or other) rated poor because the fat and salt content is high‚Ä¶ it's obvious it's aged cheese!!  But in its category it is the best because it does not contain any preservatives or anything else!  I like the App, but unfortunately the product ratings are misleading because they are based only on the ingredients contained in the product and not also on its effectiveness or naturalness compared to the type of product.  For this I give only 3 stars."
5,OaklandAnne,"I downloaded this app about 2 weeks ago and have scanned over 50 products. Both of my daughters and I love how easy it is to use. My favorite feature is how it recommended similar products that are healthier. I look forward to being better able to spot chemicals and understand their effects on the body. We have already started making better purchases across skincare, sunscreen, and food. I encourage everyone to use it, especially if you have kids that are getting into skincare products.   Thanks Yuka.  Please do research on dish soap."
5,Z-Strike2474,"I have become much more informed on products to avoid thanks to this app; my skincare has completely changed as a result. I even choose to contribute as a premium member, although the search option unlocked is very limited. The filters are extremely rudimentary and products are very case sensitive to find. Not to mention only 20+ products are presented on a given query. Although overall extremely pleased to the app. The summaries provided for each individual ingredient will be imperative for ALL of my future skincare purchases (I had a 0/100 shampoo!)."
5,Wandering Vegan Dudeüå±,"This app is awesome easily scan products and you will get a break down including hazardous ingredients. The app will also list some healthier alternatives. This is the app we all need especially in the US where almost every product on our store shelves is filled with hazardous & toxic ingredients, and we wonder why our rates of disease are so high. I realized through scanning everything from deodorant, lotion, make up, and most importantly all kinds of foods that the standards in the US for product safety are extremely low or non-existent. No more googling unknown ingredients a complete product break down is just a scan away."
5,Givin_out_info,"Ok so I had a family-member of mine, and they had this app. She explained how the app works. It shows all of the hazardous risks, low risks, limited risks, and risk-free chemicals in things you use to put on you, much like make-up, sunscreen, perfume, etc. It also shows you the ingredients put in the foods. It shows if there is too much or too little of something. Example: It shows if it has too much sodium. This app is a huge life saver, this app should be highly recommended. SPOILER ‚ÄºÔ∏è: This app is the reason I don‚Äôt eat ramen anymore, it has some very hazardous things that can cause nausea, headaches/migrains, breast cancer, and heat flashes. THIS APP IS AMAZING!!!!! ü§©‚ú®"
5,Albo D,"I received a response from the Yuka team regarding this post. Very impressed to see their response.  Revising my Review accordingly.   Something fishy is going on. I was enjoying scanning 20-30 products at the grocery store yesterday, and making so many discoveries, good and bad, about foods I normally consume. Then I got to the bacon. With all the mostly negative ratings among 7-8 bacon brands, *NONE* of Yuka‚Äôs ratings even *mentioned* sodium nitrates or celery powder, both used as preservatives ‚Äî- both with many health flags associated with them. Why not, Yuka ?? This raises trust flags for me with Yuka. [ Note: I bought my bacon at the butcher instead ]."
5,77Bart77,"Love this app! The FDA clearly sets the bar very low when they allow products that contain so many artificial ingredients and chemicals. It‚Äôs amazing to compare products with this app to see which ones are healthier- don‚Äôt confuse this for what tastes best! Use it to find what is healthier. Scanning a product is easy and the app will tell you why it is good or bad. It will then give you alternatives that are better for you. Don‚Äôt forget to check things like deodorant, shampoo, skin care, etc. Of everything I used, only my deodorant was rated highly. Had to start over with everything else, but used the recommendations."
5,Vic78!,"This app changed my life. I had no idea that some of the foods I was feeding my kids were toxic. I can‚Äôt believe the FDA allows these foods on the market knowing it‚Äôs toxic for our children.  I was very surprised to see even some of my ‚Äúclean‚Äù beauty products had mildly toxic ingredients. I know it‚Äôs going to be a small investment up front to change out some of my products, but isn‚Äôt your life worth it? Will you care about that $20 dollar face wash you need to throw away when you find out you or your family member has cancer? Probably not. Use this app if you care about yourself and your loved ones."
5,Awesome!$&!&:!!!,"Kudos to your small team for doing such a great job with this app! I very much enjoy it so far.  I would recommend adding a ‚ÄúRate this app‚Äù somewhere within the app to bump up your 5 star ratings, it would also be helpful for users to submit ideas/feedback to help you make the app even better. Free labor force, use it :)  One thing I would love to see is the ability to put in diet restrictions. For example if I‚Äôm celiac and also allergic to other things, I could put those into my profile. Then as I start scanning food items, you guys could warn me if it contains something I‚Äôm allergic to. My sister is the one that‚Äôs celiac and it‚Äôs always difficult to buy her snacks and food because I‚Äôm always worried about buying the wrong thing. She is more careful since she deals with it everyday, but I don‚Äôt have any idea since I could basically eat a shoe and be totally fine. I would definitely use that feature if I had it, when picking up snacks at the store.  Cheers!"
3,Haleyf_owler,"Pro: it really does a great job of telling you exactly what in your products is giving it the rating it gives, abrief easy to understand explanation of why and a link to additional information.   This app is only free if you have the box in hand and can scan the barcode, otherwise you can‚Äôt get information The fact that I have to pay to search for item is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt have barcodes for everything i already own, and having to go to the store to scan everything I‚Äôm thinking of purchasing is ridiculous. I‚Äôd pay for the app as a one time fee for that feature, but I‚Äôm not paying a yearly or monthly membership.   I also don‚Äôt think the recommended swaps always make sense. I scanned a facial moisturizer and it recommended crackers once? Another recommended a moisturizer that is available only in Canada. Scanned a face wash and it recommended a body lotion.  It‚Äôs also really hard to submit a correction. I scanned a Kristen Ess dry shampoo and the app gave me the rating for a mousse. There‚Äôs a button to submit corrections but it‚Äôs really difficult to work through."
5,That‚Äôs unfortunate,"I chose to pay for Yuka because I believe they are all geniuses! As I‚Äôve taught my kids‚Ä¶.‚Äùknowledge is power!!!‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a life changing App! It helps me make healthier life choices from food to skin care etc! If you don‚Äôt download this App, you are missing out! I definitely should be a part of this team! It‚Äôs a game changer for sure!  Some Hippocratic people think the company may be paid by big companies, quite the contrary, they site every source of info!  They also never sell your info and are the most responsive via email I‚Äôve ever seen!  Do yourself a favor, be a Yukateer! lol"
3,scottely,"I love this app but there‚Äôs one main problem.  I‚Äôm trying to use this app to help with buying products without seed oils. The research is clear that seed oils (hydrogenated vegetable oils, etc) are carcinogens. I just checked two products (one with and one without) and the app is not flagging these. In fact, it recommended the other product. To me the science supports that these oils are a bigger red flag than a little more saturated fat. It‚Äôs a challenge to find things without these oils because they are used a lot in industrial food production. Please update your database for this! I‚Äôd love to change this to a 5 star review because this app is otherwise great and needed‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll save more lives. Thx for considering this üôèüèª"
5,notthatjazzy,"Love this app. I didn‚Äôt see anywhere to suggest features, so I just wanted to add here some ideas that I feel would make Yuka truly perfect. (1) Filtering by specific rating numbers. So, for example, if I want to see only products rated 90+, I can filter it that way. (2) Be able to see the specific number rating in the search area, rather than just ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù ‚Äúgood‚Äù etc. (3) Be able to make multiple lists with items, rather than just a single favorites list. (4) Cruelty-free verification! Specifically Leaping Bunny, which is a more trustworthy certification than PETA."
5,Nice99994,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I just had to say, THIS APP IS THE BEST!!!!!! Changed my life for the better!! People are shocked with my age thinking I‚Äôm anywhere between 17-20 years (I‚Äôm nearing 30) because of how good my skin looks. I only use Yuka approved products for my skin/hair. And I‚Äôm also trying to eat only Yuka approved food. It‚Äôs tough sometimes to give up on foods we‚Äôre so used to eating, but once you check with Yuka and see what some ingredients do to your body it‚Äôs so much easier to give it up! Thank you Yuka creators for this amazing app ü§çü•∞ I‚Äôve shared this app with so many people and will keep sharingüòâüëçüèº"
5,julia71649291,"I love this app, it‚Äôs a simple way to figure out how great a food or cosmetic is and determine if there‚Äôs any harmful additives, it‚Äôs really simple to use as well. My favorite part, though, is the fact that you‚Äôre able to become a premium member. It offers a few more benefits, but the app let you CHOOSE how much you wanted to pay, ranging from $8.99 to $18+ for a year, which is what I love. I like that you‚Äôre able to choose how much to contribute, and that you‚Äôre still able to use the app just find without being forced to pay. I find this app to be very friendly and definitely worth getting!!"
5,Customer Support Needed!,"The YUKA app is beyond phenomenal with vital information on so many products- food, cosmetics, supplements, and more. After using the app for just two days, I saw its merit and chose to go for the Premium version. The BEST premium app I have on my phone! If you are interested in what deleterious chemicals and ingredients we are unwittingly being exposed to, then this app is for you. It goes a step further and offers alternative products for you to use. Do not assume that a product purporting to be ‚Äúclean‚Äù is!!! Use this app to find just what is in it. Congrats to the team for creating and updating it. Kudos!"
5,bunnylama,"Thank you for this great app which allows consumers to make informed decisions on food and cosmetic products they already use and those they want to purchase in the future. I checked all of my shampoos, conditioners, deodorant, creams, lotions, body wash, and sunscreen products. What a shock to see that the top brands I was using had toxic chemicals in them. I immediately replaced with Yuka approved products that rated excellent. I also use the app as I shop for food products and have now given up the ‚Äúbad and poor‚Äù items. This app helps me make immediate and good decisions to select the brands that have the highest Yuka ratings. Thank you!!!"
5,ŒÜnnathetis,"I have come to rely on this app for everything. Finding out that 90% of my cosmetics and food were toxic was hard to come by initially. However, now a few months in and my hair and body feel amazing. I wish other apps like think dirty and ewg had all the products this app has. The best feature is if it's not in their database, they allow you to send a pic and description of the ingredients. 90% of the time, I was still in the store and could decide. I recommend this app to lots of people. Go grocery shopping or go to Sephora. You will be amazed at how many products this app has."
4,vickicantfindaname,I‚Äôve had the app for over a year now and find myself going back to it every now and again when I remember it‚Äôs there & get the urge to be healthy again.  I really want to see some expansion though! Again great app but these are some things i‚Äôd like to see Products organized by country in search: A maybelline cosmetic from a different country may not have the same results as one in the USA.  Products grouped together: 6 Maybelline mascaras that are all the same having different ratings (usually close together ratings) but it gets a but confusing!!  Budget!!!!!!!!! Recommendations based on budget!  My biggest reason for going back to this app now is so I can eat healthier but on a budget. I go to the lowest to highest prices on the walmart app then search them on yuka to see what the cheapest safest option is. The price doesn‚Äôt need to be exact if this was incorporated into the app! Just a low budget/high budget rating would be helpful.  This app has so much room for growth and expansion and I‚Äôm ready to see it!
5,Mxspartan,This is one of the best tools to have when your shopping for groceries. It gives you detailed information about every item you scan with a barcode. Just take a picture and all the information pops up. Even if your not into fitness it truly is a tool to see what you are putting into your body. You can even add items that are not listed you just have to make sure your post accurately all the ingredients of the product. This is a 5 star app all the way I recommend it to anyone young and old alike. Keep up the good work üëçüèΩ.
5,LdyDi11,"I‚Äôve had this app for a few months now and it has changed the way I look at food and all products. While I have been into health, fitness and nutrition for many years, I had no idea how many dangerous ingredients have been allowed in our food supply and personal care products! Certain foods have been banned in other countries because of their toxic ingredients!  Thank you, Yuka for giving us a way to protect ourselves & take control of what goes in and on our bodies. Keep up the great work!  I am literally cleaning out my kitchen, bath & laundry ( yes! ‚Ä¶. even laundry detergent!) with healthier options."
2,Roboman270,"First this is one of the best designed apps I‚Äôve seen. The scanner is super fast and allows you to rapidly scan each item and move to the next. The only TWO things I wish it had are: 1) a rating for how processed a food is. Is it ultra processed, highly processed or whole? I‚Äôd like to know that. I would like that rating to take it to account the food matrix which is how much the underlying structure of the food has been destroyed through temperature, pressure and mechanical pulverization 2) the ability to custom tailor the rating to your own personal preferences and goals. For instance maybe keto is more important to you than hypothetical limited data studies showing possible effects of food additives. Which I think is often overstated in the app."
5,micro2023,"I personally I have benefited so much out of this application, as it has show me the true colors of what we are encountering in the supermarket(s), by scanning the item before you buying it , it will make the difference of healthy consumption or poison your body, I have got healthier since I been using the apps as I stay away from damage additives that some of these foods have. So he/she or other developers I thank you KUDOS to all of you for helping those of us that are using the application giving the opportunity to choose and have healthier options  THANKS all of you"
3,KatyandBrad,"This app is great! But I feel like it is lacking in some areas that could possibly easily be added! Like laundry soaps and detergents, and fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Those go on our skin in our clothing and are ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù products as well as cleaning. Other cleaning products as well as they affect us daily! One other extremely useful addition would be to let us search individual ingredients so that if a product is not listed we can search each ingredient separately and begin to draw a conclusion of the safety of the product ourselves based on the assessment of each ingredient. I‚Äôll bump up the stars as the app develops, which hopefully it will. (Please add feminine products too!!!!)"
5,xuru,"I'm usually to lazy to right reviews, but I had to for this one. Having something this handy to check on items is way too useful. Here in the US, stuff that is regulated in most other countries is common places in our food. To see tge research and chemicals in an easy to see rating is awesome. I've already replaced a half dozen items on our grocery list! Thank you for making this! Is it perfect, no, it does give some odd recommendations every now and then, but is spot on for it's rating. Only thing that would make it better would be to add item recommendations to my shopping list!"
5,That_girl98,I‚Äôm so glad I found this app. It is a great resource for anyone that wants to live a more non-toxic life. I think one of the best features is that when you scan something if it‚Äôs not the best the app with recommend something with better ingredients. So so useful. I was blown away when I went to subscribe for premium features and they had a sliding scale. It truly makes me believe that they feel everyone should have access to this information regardless of their economic situation. I have no problem supporting this app and I hope that it can continue to grow and evolve.
4,Mr. Fooseball,"For starters the app is great for its intended purpose. Giving healthier alternatives to the food in our fridge or pantry. That aspect works perfectly, but the problem that I have is, The app needs to implement specific stores that have the inventory for these products. I scanned peanut butter and all the alternatives were from Trader Joe‚Äôs. I do not shop at Trader Joe‚Äôs nor is there one in a 20 mile radius of me. What I do have is Walmart and while I know Walmart is not the healthiest store to purchase food, it‚Äôs all I have. Please include a feature that lets me designate a specific store and their products so I can go back to that location and pickup a healthier product."
5,Tdasha C.,I never in my life wrote a review on anything and after using this app I came back to write a review. It is by far the best app I‚Äôve ever used in my life. Simple and beyond informative. Wow I‚Äôm speechless. I think about the people that designed this and I thought wow. This is a beautiful world where people are using their skills to just simply make the human experience better for us. I even changed my 5 months old body wash based off this app to something way better. Thank you for this app. It truly is the best thing ever. This is the type of things that technology should be used for. Thank you.
5,Va√±e123,I found this app through a facebook page I follow to try and be healthier and I am amazed but shocked at the same time more people dont know about this app! EVERYONE should know about this app. I have been telling all of my friends and family about it because everyone deserves to know what they are putting into their bodies and I love how this is an independent app so no greedy people trying to make money off of it for their own personal gain. Please continue to stay amazing and I will keep posting on my social media and everywhere I can because this app deserves so much more awareness ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,DLG190,I am impressed at how easy it is to scan foods and get immediate info on nutrition facts. Helps me make better decisions while I‚Äôm in the grocery store. When I‚Äôm thinking about a product I‚Äôm not familiar with or when I‚Äôm tempted to buy stuff I know isn‚Äôt good for me. Helps me stay on my healthier eating goals. Plus I love the alternative suggestions offered. I know what a massive undertaking it is to create and maintain such a database. Plus checking beauty/cosmetics products very useful too. I encourage you to support Yuka with a $ donation for their excellent ideas. Keep up the good work Yuka team!!‚ù§Ô∏è
5,teddyjedy,"For anyone who has taken the initiative to better their health, this is one of those apps that has been incredibly informative. Not only does it give you a rating out of 100 (0 being worst and 100 being the best), but it also explains the reasoning behind its rating by listing and explaining the product‚Äôs ingredients. Many products that have been marketed as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù can no longer hide behind their propaganda when Yuka literally exposes and breaks down every single ingredient for you. You just scan with the app and it‚Äôs all done for you. Give it a try!"
5,Soop77,"This app is a must-have. I use it almost every time I shop, and have been shocked at some of the so-called healthy products that have hazardous additives (and I am a bit of a health nut!) I tried another similar app that was highly rated but had to watch an ad with every product scanned. With Yuka I can scan to my heart's content without a single ad.  But the app doesn't stop there! Once you realize you can no longer use that hairspray or eat those ""healthy"" snacks, you can simply scroll down to find healthy substitutions!  I'd give this app 6 stars if I could. It's that good!"
1,Midnightwolf206,"My mom decided to download this app because my aunt recommended it. Worst mistake ever. This thing ruined my life. She would scan anything I was eating, and surprise, surprise. It was a 40 or below. Now eating anything is a huge ordeal because all she does is scan. And scan. And scan. Did I say scan? It‚Äôs so dumb and illogical, this all clearly a marketing plan. It‚Äôs so obvious. Don‚Äôt you dare respond to this saying it‚Äôs not. It is. My best friend and I decided to try it out and see how ‚Äòreal‚Äô and ‚Äògood‚Äô it is. Obviously, ANYTHING YOU SCAN IS ‚ÄòBAD‚Äô. Clearly nothing is good unless you scan grass. Obviously, I get it, everything now is processed. But some ‚Äòratings‚Äô on that app are obviously inaccurate. Not saying it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs FULL FAULT. Just most. I think it would be wise to not listen to everything you see on the internet, and do outside research."
5,Lili Romeo,"I had been using this app and I am amazed of the great information that provides to educate and help us to make better choices .  I consulted with a nutritionist and she confirmed that the information given is accurate .  Everyone should know about this app and use it. it‚Äôs incredible on how business doesn‚Äôt care about people they just care about making money, and most of the food and non beauty items that are being sold are really really bad .  100 % recommended!! Please share it with the people you love . You can prevent future serious illnesses ."
5,GranolaGirl333,"Absolutely great app to keep nasty stuff out of your food and skincare! It is so worth it to purchase the upgraded feature. Now I can do my research from the couch instead of having to scan something in-store. Very detailed description of hazardous ingredients. Would love to see a short description of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ingredients, as well. The customer service team is wonderful! I‚Äôve found a few products to have different ingredients than what is shown, and it is very easy to send them a quick message to fix it! Love, love, love! Please add vitamins and supplements next!!"
5,PinkDemonz,I absolutely love this app. I‚Äôm so cautious about what I buy my kids and what they use on the daily to keep them from hazardous materials. I even try to buy organic foods and cosmetics with no added ingredients just to be on the safe side. And Yuka helps me even more with that. There are so many products that I thought were safe that actually weren‚Äôt. And Yuka easily tells you all the hazardous and dangerous ingredients in our day to day items. It even recommends safer alternatives which is a plus! I‚Äôll definitely be using this alongside all my future shopping adventures.
1,tiktok @thismansrllygonnacry,"Labels aspartame as a hazardous additive which is the most disproved idea ever. I of course read the linked sources, and surprise! Research did not link with  any increased risk of diabetes or cancer, they even linked a biased source, but only stating at the end that it ‚ÄúMAY been influenced by commercial conflicts of interest,‚Äù I would laugh at the ridiculousness of this, but cannot considering the blatant misinformation being spread especially to people who don‚Äôt read the fine lines.   Not to mention holding all foods under an umbrella, such as labeling various nuts as too caloric or too fatty, resulting in a poor score.. however they‚Äôre nuts? Naturally caloric, especially beneficial to people who burn many calories through exercise, and full of healthy fats! I just hope no one really listens to this scoring system to judge what they eat everyday ."
5,Only_Facts,It‚Äôs been too long without a trustworthy way to learn which foods are healthy and which foods aren‚Äôt. If Weight Watcher‚Äôs business model worked they would be putting themselves out of business (it doesn‚Äôt work). Yuka gives us the truth about what we eat. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking to looking to improve their diet.   P.S. for bodybuilders:  This app gives each food a score. One of the criteria is how caloric the food is. A certain food which is caloric is scored lower than a food which is not as caloric. So don‚Äôt be afraid of scores which are docked due to high calories.
4,cindyreedscott,"I heard about this app for helping people who are blind identify products. I had loaded it on my phone and hadn‚Äôt stopped to check it out until today. Wow! This has so much helpful information!! I like to make healthy choices and this is a wonderful tool. The app is mostly accessible using my screen reader which reads aloud what‚Äôs on my phone screen. I have not figured out how to go to the next scan after I have scanned a product. If anyone can tell me how to do this without closing down the app each time, I would love it! Thank you so much for all of the valuable information that has been put together in this app"
5,Lots Of Dissapointments,"I downloaded this app at the recommendation of a friend. My husband had been recently diagnosed with cancer and I did not desire to put any more harmful elements in his body. I was amazed at how harmful a lot of the everyday things that we had in our house were. Now I do not make a purchase without scanning first. It is not hard at all to give up the harmful things and find healthier alternatives. I have recommended this app to pretty much everyone, including people in the grocery store who see me scanning my items. Here‚Äôs to a healthy happy life to all."
5,MikeG222,You can‚Äôt give it 6 stars! What a beautifully developed and executed app. This app makes it so easy to make better decisions while shopping. My favorite part is the Recommendations section that shows you things you‚Äôve scanned with poor ratings and then shows you a comparable product with a better rating. I figured the better product would be some expensive crunchy granola stuff that wasn‚Äôt at my local store but in most cases the better product was right there on the same shelf. Great job on this app!
5,Dmsanfrancisco,"I absolutely love this app.  Ive always tried to eat healthy minimally processed food but sometimes you can‚Äôt help it.  I love that all you do is scan the barcode and it tells you of any bad ingredients, not only does it tell you but it explains why it‚Äôs bad and gives you alternative better products.  I also love that the suggested products are what is actually better and not suggested because they are paying them. And finally I love that this includes beauty products as well as this is an area I‚Äôm not as educated about so it‚Äôs great to know what are the better   products"
5,The Lord‚Äôs disciple,"This app makes you be able to find out if your food has chemically processed, unhealthy or cancer-causing and more you can find out if your beauty products are correct for you to use on your skin on your hair and if it is what you should really be using it helps you find out if things can send you to the hospital or give me a skin disease or if they are perfect and healthy for you and you can eat them and they‚Äôre not chemically processed Yuka is the right a app for finding out if things are healthy or not, you can scan food drinks and beauty supplies totally love the app"
5,Jazmine1998,"This app has opened my eyes to the large number of companies that greenwash their products to get consumers to buy them because consumers, like myself, usually take information at face value. Additionally, I don‚Äôt have the time to google every item on the back of a bottle and educate myself on how the ingredients will affect my well being. No need to fear! Yuka does all of that for you and you‚Äôll be shocked to find just how many name brand products (i.e., Youth the the people, Living Proof, and Ouai to name a few) are bad for you and in vice versa. Anyways I highly recommend this app!!"
5,BootsnBoots81,Thank you so much to the developers of Yuka!!! This app helps put my mind at ease because I have always wondered if certain products were actually good for me. I love being able to see all the ingredients and the explanations. When I start grocery shopping for myself I will 100% be using this app. It is so important that we as consumers are paying attention to what is being put into our bodies! It‚Äôs horrific how many foods I‚Äôve scanned that have hazardous ingredients. My hope is that this app will reach billions and we can put an end to harmful products out there!
5,gosh dinner said who,"this app is the worst app i‚Äôve had in a long time. everything about it makes me angry and confused. first, my friend told me to get this. when we hung out, she was scanning things around her house to see what your stupid app rates them. only one of the 50 products she scanned got a good rating. this is concerning that your app is telling us that the products we buy ourselves are bad for us. red flag right there. so i got the app and my favorite lip gloss was rated a 0/100. i was so sad. and it was super expensive, and super good for you so why‚Äôd it get a 0?! you guys are so biased hating on my conditioner because native is paying you to put theirs on my recommended list. don‚Äôt get this app unless you want to stress about all the products you own. after i got this app, i‚Äôve been questioning all my purchasing decisions. and are you kidding me like people don‚Äôt want this negativity so please stop spreading it around everywhere yuka."
4,pugluv2001,"I absolutely love this app as it gives me the ability to check what is in the food I eat very quickly while in the store.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because occasionally I will get conflicting results. (one example that I just scanned is  Tostitos scoop, multi grain chips) I scanned, and it said good, a friend of mine scanned on her Yuka app and she got negative score ‚Äì so mine was green and hers was actually orange or red (I can‚Äôt remember).  I‚Äôve had this happened a couple of times. So hopefully they will be a little more strict about what people upload in the future.  But all in all this is a FANTASTIC app and I recommend it highly!"
5,monocoolo123,"I strongly believe In what the developers of this app are doing. Transparency and non-biased information on products and food without monetary gain is so needed in todays world.  Green labels are being slapped onto everything and boxes are being made to look more health conscious which can be deceiving to consumers, this app cuts through all of that and gives scientific information on why a ingredient is listed the way it is, a score for easy comprehension and alternatives! I bought the premium app just so I could support this idea, even if just a small amount. You‚Äôre appreciated!"
5,njses,"If you‚Äôre trying to be conscious of the ingredients in products you‚Äôre buying and avoid harmful chemicals DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! It‚Äôs been unbelievably helpful for me when buying food and cosmetic products (especially on a budget).   The app allows you to scan barcodes of products and then gives you an overall rating of the product. It breaks down and grades each ingredient in the product based on French standards, and also (importantly) tells you why each ingredient it got it‚Äôs rating.  I live in the USA and it works on 98% of products available in stores."
5,Sbeezy-,"Family of soon to be 6 here & we depend on this app more then you will ever know! It has helped us changes our lifestyle so much & has brought so much awareness to all the junk we have out there! We absolutely love the fact it tells you every detail about what you scan & when something does scan bad or not as good, the app recommends healthier alternatives. Changed our life for the better & because of that it‚Äôs contributed to mine & my husbands weight loss. Download the app you won‚Äôt regret it, you‚Äôll be forever thankful!"
5,Montgomerycnj,"Can‚Äôt say enough about how much this app has changed my life. How many products I used to buy but have switched to healthier alternatives. My upgraded membership is so worth it because I can search for the best deodorant or whip cream etc without having to scan several in a store!  My only recommendation would be if they could rate fast food items, specifically Dunkin Donuts coffees so I can know if there are any that are even somewhat healthy besides just black coffee. Same for other fast food places. Maybe something in the future?  Thanks Yuka!!!! üôèüèª üôèüèªüôèüèª"
4,jessviica,"I love this app and have used it every day since downloading it. It‚Äôs important for me to be educated on the products that I am purchasing. There is one thing that should be fixed, though. Talc shouldn‚Äôt be listed as ‚Äúgood,‚Äù ‚Äúno risk‚Äù in cosmetics. There is a chance of asbestos being present in talc. The way companies test for asbestos in talc is testing 2 teaspoons for every 2 tons, which isn‚Äôt very thorough. If you weren‚Äôt aware of this, the docuseries ‚ÄúNot So Pretty‚Äù has a lot of valuable information about this. Several people sent their makeup off to labs to be tested, and asbestos was found, though the talc used passed companies relaxed testing methods."
4,mmungle,"Ok, so I got really excited about this app. Really trying to eat better and be more mindful of what‚Äôs going in my body and my families. I do think this is a 2 fold type thing. I love that it gives breakdown of whats in the products (like additives) and why they are harmful. However, like what am I supposed to eat?! Lol almost everything in my house has poor ratings. And i don't feel like I buy a lot of ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods.  Be prepared to get poor ratings on things you thought were OK to eat. Definitely a learning process and it does give recommendations on foods that are similar and have good ratings. So this is a love hate relationship."
5,MEB/MJB,"We are new to this app and actually had fun scanning many of the items in our cupboard to see what kind of consumers we are! Let‚Äôs just say it was an eye opener! We are making changes now as we select items in the grocery store. Products that we thought were ‚ÄúOK‚Äù come up ‚Äú poor‚Äù upon scanning. It certainly adds to our grocery shopping time, but I‚Äôm sure that gets better as time goes on.  Thank you for making us healthier consumers- I‚Äôve been describing your app as the Consumer Reports app of the food industry!  Maureen"
3,Aafortune,"I use my Yuka app all of the time. It‚Äôs my favorite when it comes to products I use on my body and helps we to weed out things with unsafe ingredients. I use it every time I go to purchase a new product for my skin, dental care, etc. I‚Äôve been able to learn brands that I know I can count on which is so helpful.  When it comes to using this app for food is where I have an issue. I don‚Äôt appreciate the app flagging things as ‚Äúbad‚Äù for calorie counts. IMO this app doesn‚Äôt know what my ‚Äúdiet‚Äù and eating habits are. I want to see flags for ingredients that are actually hazardous to my body not a flag for a protein bar that is perfectly safe but is has higher calories due to the protein density."
5,stalochstein,Discovered this App a few days ago and it is amazing.  I only use clean products.  And not just because someone says it is clean.  The standards are so very low for any beauty product in the United States.  You have to know what to look for and YUKA takes some of the guess work out of that.  Three days in and I am a Premium member.  And will tell everyone that they need this app.  Once you start looking at what ingredients are in your products and your food you will be amazed and will make different choices.  Thank you to the team at YUKA for providing this invaluable tool.
1,be REALISTIC !!!!,"This app had good intentions but has completely missed the mark.  The healthiest way of eating food is to get as much variety as possible and to focus on moderation. Just because something has sugar doesn‚Äôt mean it is bad for you in moderation. If you took what this app considers a ‚Äúgood‚Äù food and only ate that your body would react negatively as well. Food and diet is an art, not something you can dictate has ‚Äútoo many calories‚Äù or ‚Äúis too sweet.‚Äù   Checking to see if something was processed organically or not using harsh chemicals, I think, is great. It takes what is sometimes beyond the label and shows how a product is sourced.   Otherwise it is not accurate to say what is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù when each persons body needs different things. There is a LARGE group of people that I come in contact with daily that use this app as a law. They are cutting out not just brands but food because the app scored them too low.   Again, this app had good intentions but has completely missed the mark. Food and diet isn‚Äôt black and white.   I hate seeing relationships with food suffer because of this app labeling nutritional needs as a ‚Äúbad choice.‚Äù"
2,zyra sprouse,"I‚Äôve been trying to contact some one for a while now. The app was cool at first it was cool seeing how you guys reviewed products, I got premium and it said something about not wanting money just a little donation and I of course donated some change worth, I can‚Äôt remember how much because it‚Äôs been a little while, like a little over week or so later yuka pulls over $10 out of my account this app is very interesting and fun to explore but I would NEVER spend $10 to get food reviews that aren‚Äôt 100% accurate. I really hope this reaches someone because I need my money back I haven‚Äôt even touched the app after the first 3 days of use.. (also the reason I can‚Äôt speak to an agent on the app is because it won‚Äôt go to English)"
5,Icey cool,"I love Yuka so much. It entirely changed the way I grocery shop and gave me the tools to be able to decipher what products are genuinely good. It‚Äôs also shedding such a bright light on deception in the global food industry. On a micro as well as macro level, Yuka is pushing the bar so much higher. And even more amazing: no ads, no external product marketing, no corruption! I just got the yearly subscription just to support the team. I hope they can continue to keep the app independent and I hope this makes the impact on food that people with too much access to supermarkets/industrial goods need."
5,Charlomama,"I can‚Äôt believe how awesome this app is. You have made it so simple to choose better foods! It can be so overwhelming keeping track of good ingredients and bad ingredients, which ones to avoid for my child with ADHD, etc. The guesswork is no longer mine bc you‚Äôve put it all in black and white in an easy to use app. My favorite feature is that there are recommendations given of foods to buy  instead of a certain item that might have a very poor rating. Finally an app truly for the people and not the diet industry or the food industry. Thank you so much!!"
5,emily00sunshine,"I love this app so much. Really helps me make better choices with food and has helped me learn so much about my beauty products. Slowly have been changing all my beauty products and have been noticing the difference on myself! Now I don‚Äôt agree with everything on this app about food, for example, it does not like whole fat products like sour cream. It shows to choose a fat free or low fat product which I rather the full fat with less ingredients then more ingredients for less fat. So I use it as a guideline to see if there are any yucky additives."
1,Brady watkins,"I got this app because i have been trying to eat healthier, but every food item scanned with it was a 0/100!! Even organic apple sauce!! This is such a bad app and you should definitely stay away from it, because it also did some scary things to my phone. First when you get a free app you should not have to give them your information, the even asked for my social security number and pin! Also when i scanned skittles it sent me a threat and told me not to eat that. And when i scanned  Doritos  my phone just shut down and would never restart. I hade to buy a new one, and trust me, iPhones aren‚Äôt cheap. And now here i am writing this review about and app that caused the death and destruction of millions of innocent people. Go get Minecraft instead, its a better use of your money."
5,ShannonL1973,I use this app daily. One of the only apps I pay the subscription on to use the extra features. It‚Äôs basically a contribution to support the app and opens up many more great functions. I use the app while going through the store and have found numerous things I thought were supposed to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù that I scanned and left on the shelf. Try it. You‚Äôll be glad you did. My friend uses it as well and lets her little girl scan the items. I think that‚Äôs a great way to make kid‚Äôs conscious of what choices to make and what to watch for.
5,ftmobile,Yuka is honestly hands down one of my favorite apps. The amount of work and effort the creators of this app put into it is incredible. The fact it‚Äôs free is just mind-blowing! I love subscribing and paying them the max amount yearly because they deserve it!! Seriously. This isn‚Äôt some paid review or something either. Me and my fianc√© use this app constantly. He loves to use it when he‚Äôs tryna to secretly buy me some skin care product lol üòÜ and honestly every time I‚Äôm looking at a new product I immediately go to use this app. Seriously 10/10!! ü©∑ü©∑
5,Rachelk29,"I got this when trying to find better cosmetics to use for my skincare, but this app has been so helpful for food too! I recently learned about all the bad things that can be put in our food and this takes a lot of anxiety away from trying to figure out if something is good or bad for me I use it for everything and have shown a few of my friends too.  Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! I highly support this app and it makes it so much easier to know what you‚Äôre putting in your body and find healthier alternatives."
5,Aurora4422,"Just installed this after learning about it from a friend, rarely I write a review for apps I DL mainly because I delete most due to advertising and pay to play so too speak.  As someone who became pescatarian 7 years ago I‚Äôm always conscious of what I‚Äôm eating.  So far there are very few items in my house that are low rated, but surprisingly a balsamic glaze I use on salad has a harmful chemical added I never new about until I used Yuka.   That in itself makes the app a powerful tool in healthy eating. To the developers thank you for creating such a wonderful app."
5,Reininger,I was told about this app by my hairdresser. Little did I know that the shampoo I was using that was Salon quality was hazardous. I have scanned everything in my house. I struggle with migraines and found that some of my food had additives that can cause migraines. One of which was a healthy fruit popsicle. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the labels and what they say. I scan everything!! I have my 80 year old in laws addicted to the app also. Thank you Yuka for increasing our health and knowledge of what is in these products. I absolutely love this app and enjoy sharing it with everyone I know. üíó
5,bull2671,"Thank you for the Yuka App. Our family has definitely been blessed by scanning the products prior to purchasing. I have an endocrine issue and love using certain fragrances. By way of your recommendations Yuka has helped me change to Vegan perfumes that are better for my health and my heart BPM is no longer all over the place. Also, it has confirmed the good purchases we have been making and helped us adjust for better ones along the way.  We truly appreciate the research you conduct to change and transform lives. Muchas gracias"
5,WannaTango,"This is my first app review‚Ä¶because Yuka deserves it!! I started using Yuka and it immediately improved my quality of life. I‚Äôve never had a easy way to identify good vs bad food. Its also fun to scan items!   You‚Äôd be surprised what foods you find are terrible for you. Specifically, letting me know if there are hazardous ingredients included. I hope apps like Yuka(and the people behind it) help push companies to include a higher standard of ingredients in their food. Just because they are allowed to put hazardous ingredients in their food‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt mean they should!    And not just food, wait till you start scanning the soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. you use! You‚Äôll find out quick the major brands are having you apply toxic ingredients to your body daily!   Yuka Team ‚Äì thanks for your hard work. Please stay true to your mission and never stray away from reporting the truth about ingredients included in food! What you are doing is important!"
3,JmonkeyS98,"I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this app yet. I‚Äôve scanned something‚Äôs that I KNOW are not bad for you, (non GMO keifer) and this app says it‚Äôs horrible. Then I scan acne body wash with artificial dyes and it says it‚Äôs good? For the most part I know I eat really clean and this app says pretty much everything is bad for you. Naturally colored, naturally flavored electrolyte power bad for you? I think it really bases everything on service sizes and not what the actual product is. I wouldn‚Äôt really take anything it says into to much consideration. I think if your eating mostly non GMO foods, organic food and everything else as naturally as possible your good. This app says it‚Äôs bad for you though."
5,mdunham2,I found it overwhelming to figure out which additives are harmful- this app is perfect for that. I love that you get an overall score and then you can drill down to see what matters to you and that score. For example I‚Äôm concerned primarily with additives and can see that isolated from other measures like sodium levels if I want. The scanner is sensitive and very easy to use; it even scans upside down or sideways so you don‚Äôt have to spend time focusing at the grocery store. Some things have surprised me so this is very helpful and informative.
5,Bay Step,"Living in the US, where there‚Äôs a lack of regulation to protect consumers from harmful products, I really appreciate how this app gives us the knowledge to make decisions to protect ourselves and our loved ones. It allows me to give my money to companies who are making the right decisions in creating healthful products, and to boycott companies who include CARCINOGENIC ingredients in what they sell so they can maximize profit.   Thank you, Yuka team for making this app a reality and giving power back to the people to make smart decisions about what we eat and put on our bodies."
5,skinny wig,"I‚Äôm on a food mindfulness journey, and after struggling and recovering from ED, Yuka has been extremely helpful in helping me achieve my goal which is to be mindful about how I can feed my body properly. My favorite feature is the recommendations that they give you when you scan something that might not be the healthiest option, giving you adverse products that are healthier for you ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre craving sweets; this has taken a lot of food guilt away and helped me feel better about what I‚Äôm eating. Incredible app!"
5,River Styx,"I‚Äôm a time where companies have gotten off track with what products can contain be it excessive salt or sugar or even dangerous additives, Yuka is essential. Give a good quick overview of the Product you scan and even offers alternative products that are better for you. If your someone who is looking to lose or maintain weight it‚Äôs really good. Scan the item you want eat, get the score and check alternatives. I‚Äôve switched from countless products that scored under 20 to ones that now score 80+. This is my go to app at the grocery store."
4,MaJax772003,"I‚Äôm very excited to have found this app as it has already proved very useful!! I‚Äôve been scanning products I have around the house and filling up my garbage with junk products I used to think were good!! I don‚Äôt think the ratings for all food products are necessarily accurate though, because it doesn‚Äôt take into account presence of seed oils, and it also assigns a lower score due to the presence of fats, which are not necessarily bad for you!  I upgraded my membership to try to tweak my preferences and will update with how it works!! Overall very happy, and sharing the app with family and friends!"
4,JP'S Desert Khaki,"There are plenty of times you are out shopping & you think you are picking up a good product, but this app corrects your guess work.  It is very convenient to have this tool at hand to o reinsure your purchases for your family‚Äôs health. Although I have ran across a few items with ingredients I would shun away from that this app approves of, you have to weigh the reasoning and decide for yourself how much it means to you. Reject or purchase is that one ingredient a killer for your choice, yes or no? For the most part I feel it is a worthy tool when grocery shopping."
5,Timbeaux05,Honestly this has been a total game changer for me and my family. I‚Äôve been on a mostly successful health journey for 8 months and recently downloading this app has transformed how my wife and I shop and plan for our family‚Äôs meals and treats. It‚Äôs an incredible tool to fight all that is poisoning our food is doing to our bodies. Especially in the USA. It‚Äôs scary to see the things these companies have been able to put in our food and the scientific backup helps us better understand the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô!   Thanks Yuka team!
5,BoratOolala,"This app is amazing. I use it to avoid hazardous ingredients. If I‚Äôm buying at the store and I for example see two different bread loafs, I can scan each of them and see whether they have harmful ingredients, so when I walk out of the store I felt like I‚Äôve taken steps to improve my health.  I don‚Äôt think they list ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, which I‚Äôm a little confused by. But the app has a great interface. I even bought a membership today, and I‚Äôm the type of guy that rarely buys premium versions of apps."
5,Ivanforeva,"This is an amazing app, tells you what you are eating and it gives it a score of how harmful it may be. It can even scan beauty products and I just found out every skincare item I‚Äôm using is bad for my skin. This app is amazing and it even tells you an alternative list to compare to what you are currently using. Only thing is that you do have to be a member to search items instead of having to scan them, although the lowest option is 8.99/yearly which is amazing! Highly recommend this app!"
5,kapotoch,This app is literally so amazing! It‚Äôs shocking to find out that so many everyday products we are using on our body aren‚Äôt healthy for us. I love that you can easily scan any item‚Äôs barcode and it will tell you all the ingredients and what the rating is. I used to use Think Dirty before I found out about Yuka and this app is so much better in my eyes. Think Dirty was always trying to get me to pay and Yuka is free and so amazing! I also love that you can scan food too! 10/10 recommend everyone to have this app scan your entire house üòÖ
5,lc250w82,"I can‚Äôt think of a single app that I would rate as positively as Yuka. Incredible mission, service to consumers, and design/ease of use. It‚Äôs even fun to go through the grocery store with my family and be appalled by the amount of junk in our food system. Once the horror subsides, Yuka helps empower us to stay away from hazardous items in the pantry/kitchen and has absolutely changed our lives for the better. I tell everyone about Yuka and have converted many happy customers. Thank you so much for your work and service, team Yuka."
3,MichelleLK39,"Yuka is okay, but definitely not the best app for finding clean non-toxic products. There are several beauty products I scanned that have come up as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù even though Talc is in the ingredient list. I emailed  Yuka about this and they told me Talc is not dangerous which is not true regardless if it‚Äôs deemed safe by the FDA. I use Yuka with a grain of salt and cross check everything with the other 2 apps I use. On top of that you have to pay just to search for a product which is ridiculous, especially when you can‚Äôt trust the results. The only thing I do really like about the app is how fast it scans, and it‚Äôs rare that what I scan isn‚Äôt in their system."
5,Nomorebs27,My coworker told me about this app at lunch one day and we scanned products during lunch it was such a relief knowing this was out there.  I‚Äôm pretty good about looking at labels and researching products but this makes it so much faster.  I had been trying to tell my husband for a while that his shakes were no good I downloaded the app and showed him today - his jaw dropped.  He started asking me to scan random products its amazing how people change their mind when properly informed of the risks and danger.  For the developers/creators - thank you.
4,HealthNut WannaBee,"For most people that are very interested in the nutritional value of foods typically they are going to be health and fitness conscious. Which also means that these folks will tend to have things like high protein powders used on a regular basis and with so many different high protein powders out there, it would be great to see a rating based upon how much sugar each has and if there is any bad ingredients in them. I do hope you consider adding this Food group to thisapplication soon because this would be a high value area that many of your users would be interested in!"
5,Di Lott,"This app is now my go to before using and/or purchasing any items. I‚Äôve been researching ingredients myself but this makes it a lot easier! And I‚Äôm learning as well. I‚Äôve thrown out so many products! I had a lot with poor ratings. Why settle for even just a good product when there are excellent ones out there! I love how it suggests products too, so it helps you find the good products to use. So happy to finally get rid of all the products that are potential endocrine disrupters. There are soooo many!"
5,@ginaconnects,Thank you for creating this app! My 20 yo daughter for told me about it and now that I consult it regularly I feel much more responsible about my health and beauty item purchases. Products that got my attention previously because of marketing dollars but have been found to be not safe for me or the environment are getting tossed from my cupboards. And it has clued me into much better products that are simply less well known. Favorite recent example is Shea Moisture body lotion. It has replaced all of the Bath & Body Works lotions I used to buy.
5,Robstermac,"My hairstylist introduced me to the Yuka app. When she found out I was battling auto immune disease. This app has changed my life, helping me to realize that some of the foods I was consuming and products I was using were potentially contributing to my ailment. I have paid it forward and told every person in my life about this app. I‚Äôve even had people approach me in the store, asking what I was scanning for? I‚Äôd like to personally think the creators of this app for helping me to make healthier choices for myself and my family.  Thank you."
5,#spycee,"Our daughter introduced us to this app and now we‚Äôre hooked. This app has made a world of difference to us while shopping, the things I thought were healthy were not as it looked healthy and the labels looked good to me only to find out what really was in the ingredients and understanding what they meant. It‚Äôs so worth having this app in knowing what you are putting into your body is just as important and what‚Äôs going on your body. Thanks Yuka!!! I have told a lot of people about the app and continue to as it has changed my life."
3,Pinetree07,"It‚Äôs a great app and I‚Äôm really happy that something like this is out there to help people who are concerned with food and cosmetics now a days but first things first, having to buy premium I get it a lot of apps have it but for something as innocent as just not wanting to eat poison and to make sure your not eating poison is wrong. You need to be a member for the whole shabang. I‚Äôve scanned stuff in the past and they might have updated it but it used to be good and now it‚Äôs poor for some reason. A lot of the products they‚Äôve personally recommended me haven‚Äôt really worked out. Other then that if your willing to pay do it."
5,ReeRee v,"I joke that this app ruined my life , but in fact it showed me where I needed to change things around . Some of the things I was eating on putting in my body everyday where not good for me or my health . This app has introduced me to smarter choices . I have suggested this app to total strangers in the supermarket!! Really is a life changer . If you are Suoer sensitive about what you are using ‚Ä¶. Makeup , body lotions , hair products , you are going to feel the same way ‚Äú this app is going to ruin your life ‚Äú in a good way . Make smart choices"
5,Doublestuffedstuff,"I‚Äôm very obsessed with this app. I first heard about it in a TikTok actually, and I‚Äôve had it ever since then. I use it daily, especially when I‚Äôm grocery shopping. My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is I wish it was able to rate/include vitamins and supplements. However, I still would recommend the app to anyone and everyone, and I urge you to use it. I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about chemicals and such since using the app, which I love that there‚Äôs some education in the app as well.  Like I said-I absolutely love this app and I think it should be a staple for everybody"
5,rnjxendksbjxbd x,"I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how essential this app has become in my life. As someone who suffers from chronic illness, and every thing I ingest can make an impact to my health. This has made my life so much easier and I have come to realize how many things that I have been ingesting that I thought were good were actually bad. Every time I can I recommend this to anyone I do-my husband and I use it and it is the best thing to have ever been downloaded on my phone. I love this so much I left my first review ever in my life just to recommend it."
5,Juuliska,"I‚Äôve always read labels, followed EWG advice and tried to track ingredients the EU has banned.  But shopping this way is truly STRESSFUL. Plus, having had breast cancer at 41 (no family history or predisposing genes) I know what my family and I put on and in our bodies is extremely important.  This app has taken so much stress and confusion away.  Im not exaggerating, it‚Äôs changed my life!  I tell everyone about it and they‚Äôve reported they love it too.  I literally do not shop without it anymore. I hope Yuka starts evaluating cleaning products too!!!"
2,AuthenticityBear,"The app overall seems like a good idea and does respond fast, but one of the first things I scanned was ghee (clarified butter), which is a super food and very nutritious, and the BETTER ALTERNATIVE WAS CANOLA OIL. They may be independent, but a lot of their scoring and recommendations seem to fall right in line with the deadly advertising campaigns of the big food companies (Crisco for example). Canola oil and seed oils in general are very bad for the human health.   Look into Weston A. Price diet if you are searching for a better balance between veganism and carnism. Always do your own research. Although wrapping your head around health is complicated, remember, you are what you eat. I wouldn‚Äôt take this app‚Äôs recommendations at face value and make decisions based on blind trust."
5,CKVVAn,"I read about this app on Instagram a couple months back, and had to come back and write a review‚Ä¶. Holy crap it‚Äôs awesome!!! Changed my eating and buying habits.  Not only do I use it,but my husband, my adult kids and some family member have it- No joke!  After a couple weeks I bought the full version to use the search products- best purchase ever!  I have to say I comment a lot about YUKA on Instagram food posts and I‚Äôve told people in grocery stores when I see them struggling to read ingredient labels. Love YUKA. Keep up the good fight!!"
5,Ddbwix,"I‚Äôm a Level 2 CrossFit trainer and I‚Äôm always looking for ways to help positively impact and motivate my athletes. The Yuka app has become my #1 source for excellent information regarding food, cosmetics, toiletries, and household products. I was horrified to learn how many products I believed were healthy for me were actually unhealthy and downright dangerous and damaging. I‚Äôm eternally thankful for the Yuka app and the convenient and easy way it delivers the information I need for myself, my family, and my athletes. Keep up the outstanding work!! I absolutely love and appreciate it!!! DeeDee Wix, CF-L2"
5,appreciated guest,"i downloaded this app about 4 months ago from hearing about it through a friend, literally heaven sent. It gives you all the risk factors and sources backing them up, it scans barcodes, and it does it for hundreds of foods and materials. very informative , it states clearly that none of the recommendations they give you were paid to be there. basically just telling you the absolute best foods for you without a brand shoving it down your throat. this is a great app and should be downloaded by everybody!"
5,FreeIndeed836,"You know, with all of the deceptive labeling going on by the major brands (who also own most of the generic), it‚Äôs really important to KNOW for sure, what you‚Äôre feeding yourself, and your family.   This app has been a gift from Jesus Christ himself! I highly recommend if you, ya know, care about the fact you‚Äôre being lied to and poisoned by these companies. Not only does it reveal the truth about the ingredients, but also provides you with healthier options if available.   Download and start changing your health one scan at a time!"
5,Madameüßúüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èMermaid,With all the toxic junk in our food and products these days it‚Äôs great to have an easy to use app that clearly shows you what exactly is being put in the foods we consume and the products we use. I became a member to have full access to the app and all its perks. Once an item is scanned it will let me know if there are any allergens I need to avoid. I love this app and I also enjoy the informative emails the developers provide. A must for anyone with allergies or whoever wants to avoid toxic substances in their bodies. Highly recommended!!!
5,Noah Kerr,"I downloaded Yuka after my girlfriend showed it to me and we‚Äôve been scanning everything we use. I feel like it has allowed me to learn so much more about the things I interact with in a quick manner. I really love it! Simple to use and gets straight to the point. I would however like to see the implementation of support for alcoholic beverages. I know, I ‚Äúalready know what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù but I‚Äôm very sensitive to things like caffeine and sugar. Would love to see that feature added but either way, keep up the good work I love this app!!"
5,fknfjd,I love this app! I was very skeptical at first but am a true believer now. I love how it explains why some of my favorite products aren‚Äôt great for me and why others that I didn‚Äôt think would do well are rated high. I‚Äôve just been scanning at home but I can‚Äôt wait to take to the store and try it grocery shopping. They are just starting out so you can join at what price you want or use free edition. I love being able to review good apps. I‚Äôm hoping my daughter will try it now. Keep up the good work and thank you so much!!!
3,dancelover10,I got this app because I was interested in the additives in the foods I was eating and looking to investigate that more. I was really disappointed when I saw that foods/drinks have ‚Äúa bit too caloric‚Äù under negative aspects when calories are what provides energy.   Saying that a food is ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it has calories and then giving a ‚Äúgood‚Äù alternative with artificial sweeter and no calories doesn‚Äôt really make sense.   I also wish they provided caffeine content for beverages because providing an alternative to a caffeinated beverage to one with no caffeine isn‚Äôt meeting the need that I‚Äôm looking for.
1,Jmarino726,"This app is definitely useless. If you‚Äôre not going to specify what types of sugars and corn syrups and fructose syrups.  in addition you need to specify what types of oils are in our foods. Because the bottom line those two areas of what is killing humans too much of the fake and bad sugars and too much of the fake and bad oils. I‚Äôve asked this company a dozen times to make the adjustment to simple programming issue when we scan a product and it‚Äôs ingredients label. It could easily separate the sugars the oils like you do all the additives specify, which is a bad moderate or no risk using the same programming, you can specify the different sugars and oils. but you won‚Äôt do it. You probably are paid off by the people that don‚Äôt want this knowledge to be known."
3,cvrocco,I love this app and I am 100% hooked. Even donated to the cause and became a member. I did discover though that some sunscreen reviews and suggestions were off base and didn‚Äôt include the poor ingredients which took products from say a 93 rating to a 16. This was after I emailed the staff and they responded with having issues with their OCR reader. I do appreciate the response and the fact they did rectify the review.  I ended up stocking up on product based on the initial great review so lesson learned.  Again love the app and maybe I was the one off situation but feel you have to check ingredients list just to verify before you stock up on product. Lol.    Cv
5,bhgfdsetuiknfdssjii,"A random cashier at a gas station recommended this app one day when he noticed I was trying to pick out the healthiest energy/granola bar on their counter. I‚Äôm now addicted to this app. I scan everything! My wife also downloaded the app and we‚Äôve since swapped out so many foods and food brands in our refrigerator and pantry. We were shocked at the amount of additives, sugar, and saturated fat in some of the foods we were eating, even foods labeled organic. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to look more closely at what they‚Äôre eating."
5,Erroll Hynson,"My barber showed me this app about 2 months ago and I‚Äôve used it a lot ever since. I be scanning stuff for fun jus to see sometimes. Anyways I think if a feature where the user can I guess tailor the app experience to their own personal diet. I‚Äôve scanned a few foods that have been labeled ‚ÄúBad‚Äù because they are just very calorie dense, and that something I have in my diet. Like I said the app is amazing for real but that‚Äôs just my 2 cents on how I think it could be better."
5,Lumos1234,"This app is literally life changing.  Being able to see all of the additives, what they are, and why they‚Äôre harmful is so eye opening.  I scan almost every single item now when I am shopping and it has changed so much of what we purchase and eat.  It‚Äôs pretty interesting too to see all of the supposedly ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù products that claim to be natural or organic that still have all of these additives in them!! It also rates things based on nutritional value, which is really helpful.  Everyone should use this app!!!"
5,admvr,"Thanks to this app I am more educated and aware of the ingredients inside the products i consume. I was shocked to see the amount of toxins in my food and cosmetics, I completely wiped-out my personal care products and pantry, and replaced them with clean products! I feel more in control and less easily impressed by the packaging or ‚Äúpromises‚Äù of no added sugar or natural flavor labels. I recommended this app to all my friends and loved ones. More people should use this app! I do not buy any products without scanning them first with yuka!"
4,KJCsGirl,"I do suggest putting in dish soaps and laundry detergents. That‚Äôs part of cosmetics and people are conscious of what they use for those products. Overall, this is fun to use but also have to take it with a grain of salt when it comes to food. One thing that had sodium was poor but it‚Äôs because it was soy sauce and then an organic enchilada sauce was excellent obviously because of it being organic but it has higher sodium than the soy sauce haha. Which was listed as a negative but I just found it funny. I do give my self a pat on the back for scanning all my kids‚Äô snacks being good or excellent and having 1 poor item!"
5,UrOnTheList,"If you‚Äôre looking for great information on what you‚Äôre consuming Yuka is THE app. It‚Äôs free but if you want to be a Premium Member (comes with some additional features, but isn‚Äôt a requirement like other apps to be able to enjoy the app) they allow you to pick between 3 different prices that are charged yearly. All prices provide the same Premium Membership but it‚Äôs more of a donation to keep the app updated and improving. There‚Äôs a lot of benefits that I can list in this review but I‚Äôll keep it short."
4,Chodotron,Knowing what‚Äôs in your food with a quick scan: brilliant. What‚Äôs bad in the food with color codes: even better. Why these things are bad: even better. This is what people need no doubt. But y‚Äôall need to fix the scoring system. It is clearly weighed based on how much of one ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing is in the product and the scores are wrong. For example: a Coke Zero is a 38 out of 100 but a normal coke is a 0 out of 100. I don‚Äôt drink pop but that‚Äôs wrong. Organic jams rated worse than Coke Zero and get terrible ratings when it‚Äôs all natural sugar. Wrong. The ratings are just not always true.
5,Yuka Friend!,I began using this app a few years ago and now I don‚Äôt buy anything with out first checking the Yuka App. When you first begin you go through a cleaning out and throwing away process but once that‚Äôs done I never question what should I eat when I open my cabinets because now I can eat anything because it‚Äôs all good for me! And not only do I feel cleaner it‚Äôs so much fun! I have turned on so many people to the app in hopes that small changes make a huge difference. So all I can say is KEEP SCANNING!! And Yuka‚Ä¶thank you!
5,Jay Williams Co,"A woman in Costco saw me come templating buying  a food item. She showed me Yuka ‚Ä¶Amazing!!! I downloaded when I got hit home. Stated scanning with my refrigerator and moved to my cabinets . Foods I thought were high in nutritional value were not only low but had no nutritional value. The scan is almost instant and the data is clear , concise and compelling!!! The recommendation feature is very cool in that you now have an alternative. Recommend to everyone who is looking to make smarter healthier choices in a quick and informative way ."
5,afterburner_666,"I am a person thought of their food purchases as sensible. Low calorie, plant based, turkey instead of fatty ground beef? I‚Äôm doing great! Well, it seems that I am a victim of my own hubris. Just the simple fact that quantifiable scientific data is being used to back up the claims on some of my favorite products being horrendous for me makes me impressed at the efficiency of this app, and also scares me that I truly did not know what I was putting in, and on, my body. Thank you developers for providing such a truly life changing app."
4,Jfog58,So I think it's a little exaggerated because if you scan something like ice cream you clearly now it's going to tell you poor or unhealthy. But a protein drink I scanned ranked poor only because of calories? When in reality it should've been ranked good. I think the app needs to be better about not ranking things because of calories alone and more so harmful toxic chemicals. However I loved how this opened my eyes to harmful things in food/drinks products etc and It's definitly making switch some things. I overall like the app just think it needs a little tweak or two
5,mom of sheldon,"I never write reviews but I am blown away by this app. It is very user friendly, informative, and non-biased. My entire family and many friends have downloaded Yuka and since then we have abandoned many products that we thought were fine but are actually full of potentially harmful ingredients. I scan every item with Yuka before I put it in my cart. You can really tell the difference in overall well-being after switching your products over to those that aren‚Äôt full of additives, saturated fats, sulfates, exc. 100% recommend!!!"
5,Hutch_ppk,"Discovered this app by searching for and app that tells you what the heck you are putting into your body. This wasn‚Äôt my first choice but glad I stumbled on this app because this app is, The GOAT, out of all that I have seen so for and the big plus is that it‚Äôs free. Are these guys trying to trick me/ us or what. Who sent you guysü§î because this is just unbelievableüò≥ üíØüíØ.

5,Gulry22222,"I am always looking for healthy options and I spend hours in the store reading labels. I often times know what I read on the label but sometimes I have no idea and spend even more time on goggle trying to figure out what an ingredient is or translating a nutritional label. This app does allllllll the work for you. You can save favorites, if you scan something that is bad it suggest better options. The absolute best!! I am not sure who thought of this, but whoever you are bless you!!"
4,Submit Button,"This app is amazing for knowing what‚Äôs in your food/beauty products and finding any harmful chemicals in the ingredients.   However, the only problem I have with Yuka is that it rates products based on calories and nutrients, which is only on a scale of numbers so it doesn‚Äôt take account the volume of food. A food might be meant for a meal and have 600 calories in it but Yuma will just label it as ‚Äúbad‚Äù even if it‚Äôs healthy, which I think can be harmful for some people. Personally, I can just read over that part and focus on the additives, but other than that this is a great app."
1,saray huerta,"i heard a lot of great things about the app and i downloaded it and tried to sign up but i was already having issues???? First off, i didn‚Äôt get the option to creat an account. the app just kept saying my email was i valid. I tried closing the app, that didn‚Äôt help. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app, that didn‚Äôt help. My husband ended up downloading the app and creating my account. He logged out and i tried logging in on my phone. the app said my password was wrong? We triple checked the login info i was entering and it still said the information was wrong. He changed the password, we attempted to login again on my phone.. we quadruple checked the information and ended up getting locked out of the account lmaoo"
5,Malvers81,"A friend told me about it, but I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really use it, yet downloaded it anyhow. I am ADDICTED. And I absolutely love that there are no ads and it‚Äôs free. I scan a lot of things for my toddler, and some things have been shocking! I just received an email that Yuka is a small team of 11 people‚Ä¶THANK YOU to all of you! I‚Äôd hug you if I could. It‚Äôs crazy how I can even scan beauty products and toothpastes too. I also love how if you scan something that‚Äôs not great, they give you recommendations. Yuka, I‚Äôm soooo glad you exist, you life saver, you!"
5,@maddox8910,"Download Yuka right now! Yuka helps you find what‚Äôs Healthy and what‚Äôs not. Yuka gives positives and negatives of food products. If the food you are scanning is not in the system all you have to do is fill in the name, select the brand, take a picture of the nutrition facts (Yuka automatically fills it in), take a picture of the ingredients(and again Yuka fills it in automatically), the. It gives the rating from 0-100. Yuka also gives recommendations if you scan a bad food. So cool right. Please I am begging you download Yuka now!!"
2,hsbory,"This rating system and app make no sense. The concept is great and I really wanted to have this be my favorite consumer app but no luck. I have used think dirty for years but wanted to download Yuka because I believed it would have a larger database of products, which it does. But - I‚Äôm very confused because certain products are rated 0 or ‚Äúgood‚Äù on Yuka that are considered toxic on TD. Which I normally would not question, except, I have multiple scanned items with fragrance/parfum in them that are rated low or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù in Yuka. Along with other ingredients that I know are harmful. We all know that fragrance is one of the most unregulated ingredients and is often toxic so I just can‚Äôt trust this app."
5,Falix Oof,"I love this app, it‚Äôs very easy to use the problem with it is sometimes the product shows a different product, which doesn‚Äôt bother me too much since it only happened once. It‚Äôs super fun seeing if my products are good or bad. But I think they should make another app. For dogs! I have a dog and buy food and treats for him, also some other stuff. It would be way easier checking with a dog YUKA app rather than doing 5 hours of research. Otherwise this app itself is great, but I‚Äôd love a dog version.:)"
5,Shanneyy,This app is amazing especially if you are working to live a health conscious lifestyle. I showed it to my friend and she ended up scanning everything in her cabinets üòÇ. She was in love w/ the app just like me. The fact that theres access to the information for free is great and their optional membership price is a yearly donation of $8.99 or more that you want to give to help this independent company is a great way to get support. I definitely decided to become a member! Keep up the great work Yuka!!! I‚Äôve been sharing your app w/ everyone.
5,JWdr√ºms,"In a world of all kinds of apps, Yuka is on another level. I started using Yuka just over two months ago. The app helps me be consistent at the grocery store and buying things that are more healthy and have less garbage in them. As of this review, I have lost over 20 pounds by just eating healthier. I have been telling everybody I know about this app. If it can change my habits and ultimately my life, it can change yours too! Oh and by the way, the team is phenomenal! Thank you Camilla, Julie and EVERYONE at the Yuka team! üíô"
5,Fan of the Fairies,"I love this app, has helped me revamp my skincare routine and make better choices when shopping. My only wish so far is to be able to create envelopes or albums in My Favorites or already have the categories to be able to save the items accordingly or better yet, when selecting as a Favorite it automatically saves to the category! Currently, it‚Äôs a list of items regardless of category and I have to scroll thru to remind myself which item I need to purchase üòÇ."
3,mytw0b1ts,"The webpage for the app states Yuka has developed 3 responsible funding resources -but then they have an in-app purchase for Premium. So if we secured responsible funding resources, why do you also need me to be a responsible funding resource and annually at that? If every other app on the app-store is moving to subscriptions people really need to dig deep and ask this question because I‚Äôm so tired of subscriptions I‚Äôm purging apps that have them as in-app options if they‚Äôre not mission critical. It adds up and people‚Äôs checks are finite but the number of apps popping onto the scene daily, weekly and monthly with in-app subscriptions seems very infinite."
2,JenniferK310,"Tuna should have a poor writing, but when you scan any kind of tuna, it says excellent for every single brand. This should not be the case as there are high levels of mercury in tuna, and if you‚Äôre putting it in your mouth, and then it should be taken into consideration for the score of the food. If you eat more than two cans of tuna per week, you are at risk for mercury poisoning. When this app is telling you that food is excellent, you should be able to eat this food 10 times a day with no issues. This app greatly needs some updating. I contacted their support team about this and they basically blew me off."
5,Dkmaag,"This app is so helpful to me and I have started to realize after using this app which of the foods I‚Äôm eating are harmful and those that are very good for me and my family! I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate this and I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs idea this was, and how you did it, but I like all I can say is, I‚Äôm so extremely grateful, and it feels like a gift from God! I know that my health and my families, health, and all those who eat at my house they‚Äôre going to benefit from this from now on! Thank you again!!! Donna Maag"
5,Moniquedean,"This is the best and smartest app if you care anything about what you eat or any body and skin care products. Yuka opened my eyes to what I was eating and consuming as a consumer. I am making better and more educated choices for me and my loved ones at the grocery store and even convenience stores. This app truly changed my life for a better healthier way. I tell everyone. It‚Äôs so easy to use and I can make better choices today in a world just filled with distractions, Yuka keeps it simple and true!"
5,Ms Sorrela,It‚Äôs literally late at night and I am so pressed to leave this review. All I want to say is thank you. A lot of us are so focused on food and we forget that there are other products on the market that could be harmful to us once digested through our skin and this app has literally opened my eyes.   The fact the this app also presents us with other better options is absolutely fantastic. So to this I say thank you to all 3 of you masterminds behind this app for saving the world one scan at a time!
1,thereviewer25887544,"So I downloaded this app out of curiosity to see if it was accurate. Once I downloaded I didn‚Äôt use it for like a month. Then I actually went on the app and scanned my shampoo and face wash. It said they were both at a risk level. It gave me recommendations for better products but I literally have never seen these products anywhere before so like where do you buy them. I‚Äôm not going on a treasure hunt for the products that you recommended because that‚Äôs wasting my time and money. My shampoo wasn‚Äôt even like a bad brand either, it was Aveda. Deleting this app, very disappointed.üòû  Update: I read more reviews and a lot of people say this app is a scam/inaccurate. Don‚Äôt download!!!!"
5,carboncowboy,I‚Äôve used this for a year and have decided it‚Äôs worth subscribing to support future development and to keep them around. They have given me great feedback on several purchases and kept me from wasting money on bad purchases.    I‚Äôve seen startups with great ideas fail due to a lack of resources. I wish one in particular was still around. They were bought out and shut down in a few years when the founders were no longer involved.
5,Meliiiiiiisa,I‚Äôm always looking for ways to improve my family‚Äôs lifestyle and this app did it for me. I literally walk through my grocery store and scan every item I consider buying. I was surprised at some of the things I THOUGHT were healthy are truly terrible for you. I‚Äôm too lazy to do the extra research so this is has helped me make more informed decisions without the hassle. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to use and informative.   Thank you SO MUCH to the creators of this app. This is my favorite app by far.
5,MarilynReinly,"I have to say, I never rate apps and never leave reviews but Yuka is amazing! I am so grateful this exists. Finally, I can quickly decipher an ingredient list and make purchases based off what‚Äôs healthiest for me. Once you start to see how often you consume harmful ingredients, you really can‚Äôt turn a blind eye to it anymore. Give it a solid try, take control of what you put into and on your body, and be a consumer that only supports companies that leave the harmful ingredients out!"
5,rosswellian2,"I‚Äôm very impressed with this app. The database is enormous. It‚Äôs very simple and easy to use. It always seems to find even the most obscure items, some of which are local to my region of the US, and I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to make a national database.   It shows a picture of the item, and you can search by typing, if you pay for the subscription, but you can always scan a barcode, and it‚Äôs amazing how instant it is.  Kudos to the developers, they‚Äôre onto something here."
5,siouxzville,"This app tips the scales back in favor of the consumer. I‚Äôve had to be diligent about certain ingredients and additives for over three decades now. Finding convenience foods that are healthier has been like finding a needle in a haystack.   How I wish I had this ability when my kids were younger!   Knowledge is a key to healthy living, and unfortunately food corporations have been adding more and more ingredients to enhance flavors or shelf life. These ingredients are added according to what an adult person can ‚Äúsafely‚Äù consume.   Unfortunately, small children are often not able to tolerate those same ingredients at those levels. Much less several products on our shelves that contain the same harmful ingredients, that may all end up in one meal together.   This app gives me back my power of choice in what I wish to ingest or use.   Thank you so much!"
5,A15g14,"Yuka changed the way i shop. I‚Äôm 73. My wife and i have been shopping healthy for 45 years. Im amazed at how many products, even in the best health oriented food markets, are unhealthy. Things that appear healthy, granola, crackers ++ almost anything that is processed, is packed with chemicals, salt +.  I shop with Yuka every time i shop. It may change the food horizon. We are voting with our purchasing and ‚ÄúBig Food‚Äù responds to money. This should lead to more food options that rate good or better on Yuka.  Thank you to the Yuka founders!!"
5,MKMunroe,"I‚Äôm ecstatic to have found this app! It makes it easy to sort through all the foods and cosmetics out there that are damaging to our health. While I always expect something like a chocolate bar or cookies to be high in sugar or fat, I didn‚Äôt expect the level of additives in so many products. Yuka makes it easy to choose the products with the least damaging ingredients and, also, to choose the better products among those ‚Äúcheats‚Äù we sometimes have. Thank you!!!"
5,Nischay Kang <3,"to be honest i don't know how to feel about this app! I love it! But when I scanned some products that really helped me when I had a lot of rashes, such as Vaseline, Cetaphil, and others! they said that the product was bad, honestly i don't know if i can really trust this app, after all it is just an app, i don't really think you should trust this app, but i mean it is your opinion what you should do! And this is just my option, i just wanted to put this out there!"
5,Stone search,This is a must have app!  Just scan the barcode on food and products to find out if they contain ingredients that are harmful.     YUKA does the research and gives you the information to help you find the healthiest options.  Since using this app to check for healthy ingredients I have been shocked by what is in some of the products from companies that I have trusted for years.   This app has been very helpful and I recommend that everyone try it.  You won‚Äôt regret it!
4,Tobeysgal,"They show the ingredients list for cosmetic products, however, does not for food. I have caught a few errors and suggest you also show the ingredient list for food. The only way I caught the errors is because the picture of the product also showed the list of ingredients which was missing an additive warning. It was easily corrected via an email, but makes you wonder how many more errors are out there, that won‚Äôt get corrected because they don‚Äôt show the list of ingredients in food."
5,MaximumBramage,"I‚Äôve been using Yuka for a few months now and basically living by it now. My hormonal acne is getting clearer, my stomach issues have cleared substantially, and my hair is silky smooth. All because of mindful products  with way less hazardous chemicals.  It also helps you find good CHEAP products instead of being tricked into buying something expensive, thinking it must be better if it‚Äôs expensive‚Ä¶ right? I‚Äôm paying way less for shampoo and skin care and getting way better results.  The recommended section is super helpful and has helped me kick bad addictions to diet sodas and heavily processed sweets. Only indulging every once in a while.  Especially in America where companies are literally trying to kill us with their ingredients, this is a huge eye opener. I‚Äôm happy that I can support healthier product lines as well.  Thank you Yuka!"
5,ErinM1002,I have changed my diet to remove additives and this app has changed my life! It makes it so much easier to scan items and figure out what‚Äôs in it! I love that I can see suggestions for potentially better items from the items I have already scanned! Some things may rate ‚Äúpoor‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it may not be because of a hazardous additive it may be because of sugar or salt not so much the additives. I do like that I can select types of diets and look forward to the app adding more !
5,AgedLemon,"I think I‚Äôve written maybe two or three app reviews in my life. After my friend introduced me to Yuka I tried it out on some of my cosmetic & skincare products out of curiosity and I was appalled at how awful some of them were. This app is truly revolutionary in my eyes for closing the knowledge gap for consumers. Who has the time to look up every single ingredient on every product they pick up? This really will forever change how I shop, and I urge everyone to download this."
5,Bella Wix,I‚Äôve been using the app about 2 months and I too have learned so much from it!! Thank you to the creators! I only wish I‚Äôd known about all the toxins and chemicals that are doing our children and our bodies harm a long time ago. I‚Äôve made so many changes to my day to day routine and have lost weight and have more energy as a result! I love that you offer a healthy alternative as well to the product scanned!! That‚Äôs amazing! So much work put into the app. Thank you!üíõüíõ
4,LuxUmbra890,"Edit - after being informed of a glitch that messed with the menu they responded and fixed the problem quickly. The information given is nice and knowing alternatives is even better.  Past review - When my friend showed me this app it showed the negatives of items and other information, as well as shows recommended alternatives. When I downloaded it they showed nothing and it was limited for some reason. I don‚Äôt know if there was a change but it feels like less of an app."
1,ShadowJet1357,"it‚Äôs way too inaccurate with information on what‚Äôs actually good or poor nutrition. For example, Perfect Bars (Peanut Butter flavor is what I eat mostly) are great for you but it‚Äôs listed as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù cause it has 19g of sugar (comes from mostly honey which is a natural sweetener) 3g of saturated fat and high in calories at 340. Didn‚Äôt take into account the unsaturated fats in the item which a person may need more of. Two of the same exact things can have two completely different ratings depending on the scaling they choose to use. I‚Äôm like really‚Ä¶? -.- Apps like these can be helpful but only if the info is accurate otherwise it‚Äôs better to do the research on your own and/or read books that‚Äôs on the mark about it."
5,Amz1031,"I rarely ever write reviews, but I feel obligated to write this one. You guys are amazing, keep up the great work with this app!! I work in retail and use this app every day for a variety of reasons. I also recommend this app to everyone at work and all the people who naturally ask me what I‚Äôm scanning for. It has been a true eye opener for me, as well. It‚Äôs not an easy thing to keep your products you typically buy ‚Äúin the green!‚Äù But it‚Äôs a challenge I am willing to keep at it."
3,Rezzy3,"App works great to scan an item you‚Äôre thinking of buying. Not quite sure where all the product data is based on but some recommendations on bad or poor items promote products as that are worse. For example, pineapple juice. Scanned a juice that was cold pressed with only one ingredient. Pineapple. Recommendation was for Dole pineapple juice which also has good ingredients but with added vitamins and ascorbic acid. This juice is pasteurized which is why they add back in the lost vitamins. The other juice consists of a cold pressed pineapple. Nothing more. Still a good app but you still have to compare for yourself."
3,mollyannehydorn,"I really like this app for making decisions between competitors in the grocery store, but if I could change one thing, I would like to see some sort of scoring based on sustainability for a product. Maybe one brand is a bit more sugary, but they don‚Äôt use palm oil or source locally or something like that. When considering our own health, it‚Äôs short sighted to only think about what‚Äôs going into our guts and not what‚Äôs being put out or taken from the ecosystem in doing so. Once again, I really like the app, but would love to see ecological impact being factored into scoring."
3,ggmsfo,"I bought a variety package of dried fruit and nuts from Costco. Each package has a different blend of nuts and fruits. All three of them have the exact same calories protein and sugars but one of the packages was rated in the 85% excellent range while the others were marked as good. Furthermore, two of the packages were marked as having not any preservatives and the other one didn't say any rating at all on preservatives. The question remains what made this one package excellent at 85% and the other two packages in the good rating and why did they all three not have information on preservatives?"
3,Fromagette4,"When I heard about this app, I was really excited! One of my children has a lot of skin allergies and it had been a struggle finding skin care products that are safe for her to use. Unfortunately, this app does not work for us. Many of the things she is allergic to are considered low risk by the app and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to have the app tell us when a product has something she is allergic to in it. If you don‚Äôt have specific allergies and just want to use better products, then it‚Äôs great. If you have to avoid specific things, then you‚Äôre out of luck."
3,Sadie-Grey,"I think it‚Äôs cool that this app alerts you to potentially harmful additives‚Ä¶ but the fact that a product gets a poor score based on fat content is one thing based on old ideas. It is metabolically healthier to eat cheese than carb-loaded Triscuits, yet this app is suggesting them as a replacement ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs also telling me that 1.5 tbsp of one thing is too caloric (40 calories), but that 1 tbsp of another thing is calorically ideal (120 calories ‚Äî like, huh?).  Ideally, the app would have controls where users can set the type of diet/lifestyle they lead (i.e. keto, paleo, SAD), so that scores are more personally accurate."
5,sydpa23,"This app is such a game changer. I was using for a while and decided recently to upgrade to premium because of how awesome this app is. It‚Äôs super helpful and super easy to use! I love how I can find the ingredients and understand them more. I‚Äôm the person that‚Äôs always looking at the ingredients and trying to determine whether to by something based on it. So rather than being indecisive, I scan the product, get a rating on if it‚Äôs good or bad (based on ingredients) and make my decision much faster. Thanks Yuka!"
5,Healthy Choice Advocate,"Yuka has completely transformed the way we shop. Scanning products to check for harmful ingredients makes choosing healthier options so much quicker and easier. The app is user-friendly and super informative. I‚Äôm especially excited about their new feature that lets us call out brands using high-risk additives‚Äîwhat an empowering way to demand better choices for our health. Yuka is an essential tool for anyone who wants to make  informed, healthier decisions."
5,Lady Di Thor,"I can‚Äôt believe how many products I had already that were scanned poor or bad. Many were expensive items. I like the way it explains why it‚Äôs bad and gives recommendations. Thank you for helping us make better decisions and what to avoid. I use this every where I go shopping and spread the word about this app to help others be aware of products in our stores, from food, shampoo, soap, lotion and makeup. Before it goes in my cart it‚Äôs scanned. Thanks again!"
5,JaceRommm,"I‚Äôve been using it for around a week now and have encountered only a single issue which I believe to be because the item simply has not been rated yet; The issue is that when I scanned the item it got into a loop and kept beeping. Other than that it Is a great app for literally everything, it helped me buy and identify soaps and hygiene items that could simply hurt me or that I could be allergic to and replace them with good replacements. Same with food."
5,Mari-luVA,"I like being able to get quick shot of nutritional value of specific product. When I scanned my 2nd product, the nutrition numbers did not match product container. I saw a way to report a problem and did so, not expecting anything to happen. I was so surprised to receive an email a few hours later, acknowledging mistake and note it was updated to correct numbers. I immediately rescanned and it was accurate. Great Customer Service!!"
5,Kfkdjdjjd,"I have never written an app review before, but Yuka deserves one. It has changed my life in helping me pick the right foods when I go to eat. I had no idea the amount of chemicals and for lack of a better word ‚Äúcrap‚Äù that I was putting into my body on a daily basis. Since I‚Äôve started using Yuka I have been feeling better every single day. More uplifted, more energetic, and just all around more content. I cannot recommend this app enough! Thank you so much for this app!"
5,Sod1111,"I now scan every product before I buy it, switched around many brands and products because of this app, it‚Äôs so sneaky how the companies advertise their product as healthy and beneficial but no one talks about all the hidden unwanted substances. The app is a must have, a big thank you to the developers, we need more people like them and more Apps like this one.  Can we please develop another app for cleaning products.  Job well done guys, great work, much love and respect, thank you."
5,the truth ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,This app literally changed my life for the better. Getting better products for my hair and body is so much harder than you think but not with this app it makes it easy and it also give you recommendations!!!!  For similar products!!   This app also works the same way with food you scan something you love and it come up with a bad score well here are some healthy options it‚Äôs amazing this is a game changer!!!     Thank you so much for this app!!!!
5,allenyo7,I know tons about eating healthy and I wish I had this app at 21 year old. Instead I spent years having to learn everything manually. Fortunately I never could fully wrap my head around not good products like shampoos and lotion etc so this is amazing. Wish I had this for food back in the day ü§∑ but it confirms what I already knew so that is still helpful too! Anyone who needs help being healthier this is the greatest app of all time. To the entrepreneur behind this: I love you lol
5,Fear loathing 84,I am so happy about this app because I actually feel safe from harmful products in food. I have been feeling sick for a long time and allergy symptoms and couldn‚Äôt figure out with the doctors for two years why I feel sick all the time. I use this app to cut out all hazardous foods. I have suggested this app to so many people in hope it helps them too be able to eat healthier with the help of this app. Also thank you for not charging to us it. Thanks for that kindness!!
5,Mizz Coko,"I am so grateful for this app. Period. I am a cancer survivor, and I had no idea of the harmful chemicals and additives that were being added to our food. Needless to say, I‚Äôm very disappointed in the United States for allowing unsuspected and citizens to be harmed all for the game of a dollar, but this app gives us hope because it lets us know there are people that care will help us help ourselves again. Let me say thank you for the creators of this app. Me and my family are most grateful."
5,Thisiscray!,"First of all, I‚Äôm an actual human not AI or paid anything for this review. I was turned on to this app after I saw a woman using it while she shopped. I can‚Äôt stop sharing this now w everyone bc of how useful it has been for me! I would definitely recommend anyone who cares what they are putting in and on their bodies from food to all things hygiene‚Ä¶I promise it‚Äôs a game changer! Great and intuitive work developers this should be available to everyone! Thank you!"
5,AkashVyas03,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy in college and i have been using this for years. My goal was to use stuff that isn‚Äôt damaging to me, and this is the best app i‚Äôve found! I was looking for something very convenient and easy, but also backed up with science, all while being nice to look at. I tried many other apps but they weren‚Äôt up to my standards. Yuka also had everything rated that i‚Äôve scanned. I would highly highly recommend Yuka."
5,Giselle.D,"I am so grateful for this app. It literally changed my life! Yuka made it extremely easy to be more environmentally aware of the products we consume everyday. Reading the labels/ingredients of products can be so confusing and time consuming. Yuka rates products on a scale from 0-100 AND it explains why each product got the rating it received. It even tells you what the ingredients mean!   Be prepared to get rid of a bunch of products (cleaning products, hair/skin products, food, beverages etc) I also use this app while I‚Äôm shopping to ensure I‚Äôm selecting the right products.  To conclude, I wish I had known about this app sooner. I can‚Äôt stop using it. I have to scan everything nowüò≠!!!!  If I could give this app more than 5 stars, I would and NO I‚Äôm not being dramatic. 10/10.  To the creators of this app, thank you!"
2,c.book.review,"The idea behind the app is great but there are major issues with the execution. Many products I have scanned and searched populate with multiples, many are missing ingredients/information and therefore there are different ratings for the same product. The recommended alternative products usually aren‚Äôt fitting. I‚Äôve sent reports for missing ingredients and the items are still on the app. Also important to note that the ratings are solely based on the ingredients used and how the app ranks those individually, not necessarily the quality of the product as a whole. Still has a lot of potential, just needs some help."
5,Sebastiano1963,"Thank you for hard work you guys are doing, I find the Yuka App to be one of the most Helpful and Honest App out there this days, and this is coming from a person whom don‚Äôt like social media apps nor any other apps.  Keep up the great work guys. And just to be on record!!! I have no idea who the founders are, so there‚Äôs no confusion on thinking that I‚Äôm saying what I‚Äôm saying because I have some sort of relationship with the founders.  Again thank you guys. Love your work."
1,multiple upsets,I appreciate that you responded to my concern. Not sure what happened but my IPhone background returned to normal so it probably was not this app. I left the rating at a 1 simply because I‚Äôm not downloading the app again at this time and know nothing about it - good or bad. I‚Äôm not downloading it again because I don‚Äôt want personal info on it to work but that‚Äôs on me - not the app. I understand their need for it. I would‚Äôve changed my review quicker but after deleting it I forgot the name of the app - my apologies. Thank you for the opportunity to change and correct my review. I might rethink downloading it again in the future. It does sound like a great app. Thanks again.
5,MammaJoVS,"This app has changed the way I shop!! Trying to keep my family away from preservatives, additives, and harmful ingredients. Yuka makes it so simple to scan products and if they don‚Äôt have a product in their list, you can add and they will rate it in a few seconds based on the ingredients. The US needs to stop allowing these harmful chemicals into our foods and products like the European governments do!! Yuka takes the guess work out of it! Thank you!!"
5,annoiata 2,"YUKA is fabulously, comprehensive, informative, and easy to use. It‚Äôs incredible how they programmed all the behind-the-scenes linkages (with ‚Äúif this, than that‚Äù equations?) for ingredients, ratings, healthy alternatives which enable inclusion of possibly every product in existence!  For  this reason, it‚Äôs worth looking at the ingredients breakdown behind the rating.  I am mostly WFPB organic, but this is super helpful for plant-based milks and butters,  and especially for cosmetics, where even the good ingredients sound horrendous!"
5,Gypsyrose1714,"A huge Thank you to Yuka!  I‚Äôve recommended this App to everyone I talk too that even mentions health or food lol  The little ones love going around scanning everything and seeing what‚Äôs a healthy choice! And ‚Äúthis‚Äù was the thing that finally got them to WANT to make healthy eating choices? YES IT WAS  ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ègo figure ! So again ; Thank you Yuka , much love to this App!!  üôåüèª... p.s. be forewarned though , to feel a little set back when you see the things you may be putting into your Beautiful Self üò±"
2,Hdbcdzbnczbnkpg,I do feel like it promotes fearmongering and unhealthy relationships with food.  I hate the food portion. It is not necessary to break down and pick apart every food imaginable to determine if they are good or not. Food is food. It is not productive to have an app tell you that the granola bar you ate is too caloric or has too much sugar so therefore it is ‚Äûpoor‚Äú. If it rates an item as poor the app will give suggestions that are often inappropriate (like vinegar instead of mayo) or that are twice the price of the original product. This app just seems wildly out of touch with the fact that there are many people with eating disorders.
4,Elise_00,"I love things app, really. But it loses so much credibility by using calories in their rating system for food. My oatmeal this morning lost 10 points because it‚Äôs ‚Äúa bit to a caloric‚Äù. It‚Äôs oatmeal, be for real. There‚Äôs no way to accurately use calories as a way to rate the food, and they need to take it out of their ratings.   Otherwise, the app is very helpful for buying clean products and it offers suggestions for cleaner versions of similar products.   Take away the caloric ratings and it‚Äôs a five out of five app."
5,PICSYLKG,Like so many others I am making a real effort to eat healthier and Yuka is making that so much easier. I love the red light/green light visuals and the very informative additives blurbs. Yuka really highlights that just because something is marketed as healthy it isn‚Äôt necessarily good for you (questionable additives.) The one thing I‚Äôd love to see is a way to organize or sort ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù and perhaps even ‚ÄúHistory.‚Äù  Even your sliding scale fee shows a true commitment to helping people.   I truly love this app!
5,Yuka User,"The Yuka app was recommended to me two days in a row by two different doctors! I am finding it very useful to check on the quality of things I already have, (mostly good), and to make good choices when I‚Äôm shopping. I like that it gives reasons for the ratings and details about the ingredients it reviews. I will continue to recommend Yuka to people I know who are interested in making healthier choices. Thank you, Yuka, for this excellent free app!!!"
5,Lourdesüëç,"This product has improved my life and that of my family‚Äôs!  After downloading the app I scanned all relevant items in our household. I found out that many products, even though some were expensive premium brands, were of high risk. Thanks to Yuka‚Äôs developers they are now in the garbage! I now only buy products after scanning them with Yuka. I can select healthful products for my family with confidence. Highly recommended."
5,jujubeez11,"I recently encountered an issue where I broke my phone and subsequently lost my membership access on my new device. I sent two pictures and detailed my problem through the app and via email, doing so quite late at night. To my surprise, Liz responded to my email in less than 24 hours, and her response came in very early in the morning, around 5 am. Her prompt and helpful assistance was impressive and greatly appreciated."
5,jackie092901,"i love this app, the idea is great and the execution is well done. i mostly use it for the cosmetics part and it‚Äôs really helped me in the store! especially when there‚Äôs several options i‚Äôm looking at and only one or two don‚Äôt have toxic ingredients haha. the scale of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù with the percentages doesn‚Äôt seem to always fit the list of ingredients, but i can easily make my own conclusion with the information given. i don‚Äôt think anyone should be critical of the grading system because ultimately, you‚Äôre making your own choices and it‚Äôs reasonable having to read a bit before doing so.   the one suggestion i have is to add pet food/products! i understand that would obviously take time to implement, but that feature would certainly motivate me to purchase a membership. i don‚Äôt care as much about what i eat, but i‚Äôm very particular about my cats‚Äô diet which probably sounds normal to other pet owners :)  i‚Äôve tried researching on my own, but pet food is clearly very different from human food and there isn‚Äôt much helpful info out there that isn‚Äôt sponsored or influenced. i haven‚Äôt seen a pet food equivalent for yuka's system so that‚Äôs definitely an untapped market!   regardless, great app and service! thank you!!"
5,fgghtedg,"I‚Äôve never written an app review before. That‚Äôs how passionate I am about Yuka. I finally feel like I can make informed decisions about what I‚Äôm putting on and in my body. I am also a new mom, so it makes me feel VERY empowered to know that we can make healthier choices for our family.  I don‚Äôt know much about the founders, but I have to say thank you! I‚Äôm learning so much about the ingredients in my food and it‚Äôs honestly been a game-changer. God bless!"
5,zerba321,"This is the best app I‚Äôve ever had. My favorite app on my phone and I tell anyone who will listen about this app. This clearly shows you what‚Äôs in your food and why it‚Äôs harmful. I‚Äôve cut out all harmful additives (bye MOST crackers üò≥ü§Ø) and I feel GOOD! Haven‚Äôt had *cramps* since I started cutting stuff out.  Before this app, I didn‚Äôt know what was in my food. Now I do and I can have a good conscience about what I‚Äôm putting in my body AND where my money goes!  10/10 recommend. And tell YOUR friends!"
3,krovopelsin,"I recommend only using this app to see really harmful things like food dye or preservatives. Ignore the rating (bad/poor/good/excellent) as it is biased and there is no way to tweak the settings to personalize the rating system.  For example, bad smoked salmon is 570 mg Sodium and the suggested good one is 540 mg üòÑ which is still too salty per serving but it‚Äôs acceptable in such food. But wait for that: an excellent suggestion is the one with artificial smoke flavor, an additive with limited risk. Really? Less salt + artificial smoke is excellent?  And I‚Äôve seen similar bias several times. But for cosmetics it works great as it‚Äôs simply about harmful additives."
5,Things to do and grocery List,"I can‚Äôt believe how many products we eat that are causing cancer, endocrine disruptors and cause thyroid issues. By scanning products, with the Yuka app you instantly see what things are in the foods and products you consume. At least you can decide if you want to eat those foods and put those products on your skin. The app also gives you ideas of alternative items that aren‚Äôt detrimental. This app is a lifesaver, literally!!"
1,Runninmouse,"This app is horrible and hypocritically inconsistent. First of all, it treats every one who uses the app as the same without considering people‚Äôs different health goals. Second, this app overvalued saturated fats and food additives/artificial sweeteners. Without taking in consideration the dosage of food additives and artificial sweeteners, this app ranks a food as bad if it has any dosage at all in it. The poison is in the dose. This app gives people a false idea of what foods are good for them and which foods are bad for their health by oversimplifying a foods‚Äô nutrition, not considering different users‚Äô health goals, and recommending ‚Äúbetter‚Äù alternatives that aren‚Äôt even actually better nutrition-wise, but just don‚Äôt have food additives."
5,Stevie118,"Think the same brand of OJ is healthy with and without pulp? I used to, until I found this app!  You would be shocked to see your fav brand of OJ rates as poor without pulp and much healthier with it.  Works on generic and name brand products.  Many products labeled as healthy or assumed healthy are really garbage.    Great for parents as well as anyone who wants to make healthy food choices.  You can make small changes or big ones to feel and look better!"
3,AER-XIII,"It‚Äôs great to find out what additives are in my food. I‚Äôve been eating a lot more organic foods, so this helps to find what justifies their price tag.   Now, two things: 1. The rating system is pretty bad. Saturated fat and sugar are not evil. They‚Äôre fine and our bodies adapt to them. I think that this rating system will scare people off of food that isn‚Äôt boring to eat like all the plain items without sugar.   2. Not their fault, but the ingredients do get messed up sometimes. Like one of the most healthiest milks, for example, somehow had ‚Äúartificial flavor‚Äù mark when the flavor was actually natural. I‚Äôm wondering if there is manipulation going on, but who knows.   This app is a great supplemental tool to learn more about food. I feel like the ratings shouldn‚Äôt be on a 100 point scale. Just make it 5 with 1 being the least healthy. And don‚Äôt put so much blame on sugar and saturated fat. We do need all kinds of fat."
5,Seth god ormsbiggles,"Every time I open this app I‚Äôm a little bit more blown away. Truly useful and informative, it‚Äôs an incredibly important tool for those who are becoming more conscious of their health and what they are choosing to put into their bodies! The right fuel is very key to feeling and looking better, and just downright being more comfortable with ourselves which leads to more energy, more confidence, which will come right back around. Cheers to a really great app!"
3,LillyLally424,"Old El Paso chilies was rated excellent but the label states: Bioengineered ingredients!! I love this app for so many reasons, but this very mind blowing rating had me questioning their rating system.  I emailed them and asked how this could be possible since we all know GMO‚Äòs wreak havoc on our bodies. The response was, the main concern of GMO ingredients is their environmental impact which isn‚Äôt currently a evaluated by the app. (What about the impact on our bodies?) Unfortunately, anything with bioengineered ingredients should be rated poor from my estimation. Outside of this one glitch in the app, it‚Äôs excellent on every other level."
5,Zonegun117,"I cannot recommend this app more highly.  Once you try it you will never go grocery shopping again, knowing how unhealthy food you have been purchasing in the past and shocking to find that what I thought was healthy and branded as healthy is indeed not. Also saves a fortune in being able to compare brands.  Get this app.  You will thank the development team, save money and live longer."
4,The Bees-Knees,"First off, I LOVE that this uses the European standard (EFSA) vs the American‚Äôs FDA, which is stricter and prioritizes health over capitalism. That being said, I use Yuka strictly for the additives ratings and information. Seeing sodium is good too; but counting calories & macros is easy enough, so I‚Äôm not a fan of Yuka giving certain products low ratings just because EFSA would subjectively deem them too caloric or fatty. Maybe I want those for my individual goals. I‚Äôd love if Yuka had a setting or came out with another app that rated things purely on additives and micronutrients."
5,Savvyü´∂üèΩ,"Ok so I loveeeeee this app but, I have skin care. Let‚Äôs use bubble as an example slam dunk has 111 great ingredients but one low risk and one moderate risk. You‚Äôd think oh it would probably be like an 80 no! It‚Äôs a 49 just because of those two ingredients I don‚Äôt understand how but it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm not a dermatologist. I could have this all wrong but I just don‚Äôt understand. Again love the app really helpful but I don‚Äôt understand the ratings for some products."
3,angelarosasr,"I love the app it has changed my life!! Scanning to see what‚Äôs good or bad is amazing but when I want to search products that I don‚Äôt have to see if it‚Äôs good or bad, it wants me to become a member and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary. I want to search a product that I want but I can‚Äôt check if it‚Äôs good or bad and I don‚Äôt want to waste money to become a member just so I can search up product. I think this app should remove the membership and should let us search products for free. Love the app it‚Äôs amazing but becoming is a member is ridiculous. (Hope this made sense)"
2,trosesm,"It‚Äôs great‚Ä¶.. until you find inconsistencies when searching for products. I mainly use this app to help decide which products I should purchase prior to heading to the store. So one night, I looked up Huda Beauty Faux Filter Luminous Concealer, and the ratings were all over the place. I thought ‚Äúokay, maybe different shades have different ingredients‚Äù, so I looked up a couple skincare products and the same thing happened. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue if you scan the barcode since it‚Äôll take you directly to the product. However, I do question it‚Äôs accuracy. Why are there variances and which rating should I trust??"
5,poozorelley,"This app is so wonderful helps me so much if I need to find something wrong with my food the #1 for me is theirs no add and they don‚Äôt disable anything to make you pay they only offer donations. I wish every app did this when they do I‚Äôm so happy to donate. I used to think Yuka would just give ratings based on fat,salt etc. Then to find out so much more is factored in. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but you would be a idiot to give this app anything under a 5 star"
5,Lfridd,"I am a cancer survivor so I do my best to monitor what I put in my body and let me tell you, this app is fantastic for that. I can at easy scan an item in the store and figure out if this is a safe product or not. Not only that but it gives you recommendations on alternatives. Out of 10 I would give this app a 10. Would love to see a lock screen widget to make access that much quicker in the the future."
5,Rollerbladegirl,"I never leave app reviews, but Yuka has been a game changer for me. No more struggling at Sephora and at grocery stores trying to figure out which ingredients will cause cancer or have other long term risk exposure for my family and me.    I‚Äôve entirely stopped buying certain products and brands after finding out how toxic and harmful they are. I ended up splurging on the upgrade because I like being able to search to see what products ARE recommended."
5,aritina agalopol,I swear by this app ever since I found out about it! The first day I had it I scanned just about every food and cosmetic product I had and was horrified how many products were so bad for my health! No wonder I have an autoimmune issue!! This country is slowly killing us or keeping us sick on purpose it seems!! At least someone is trying to combat this madness by educating us! I could not be more grateful to the developers of this app! Thank you thank you THANK YOU!!!üôèüôèüôè
5,Chicakrit,"I will use this app forever! It‚Äôs helped me to find products I now use everyday. I still use it anytime I buy something unfamiliar. I don‚Äôt care so much about the fat/sodium in things, but seeing the chemicals in things I used to use everyday was insane! No wonder people are so sick after using some products their whole lives. It is sad companies get away with it. Anyways, you won‚Äôt regret downloading this app!! A life saver, literally!"
5,Koprest,"I love this App for how quickly it checks barcodes of food products at the grocery store. When you are shopping and you see multiple products to choose from, this App rates the product quickly based on the ingredients.  If more people were health conscious about the products they were buying, many health problems would go away. This is a great educational tool for young people too."
5,htncld2dy,My baby boomer mother is seriously obsessed with this app! She goes around the grocery store scanning everything and telling other customers about it. She‚Äôs had other customers ask her to scan the items in their cart.  She‚Äôs gotten the whole family to use the app. I‚Äôve stopped buying some foods that have really harmful ingredients- it‚Äôs hard to buy something once you see that little red dot pop up ‚Äúbad.‚Äù
1,stoptheban,"When I downloaded this app, I was impressed but I also did not know much about health. As my knowledge grew about healthy vs. unhealthy I am amazed at how many product/food are either labeled unhealthy but are actually good for you health or labeled healthy but are terrible for you. The biggest product I have noticed this with is oils. Coconut oil, olive oil, and avocado oil and the only oils that you can consume that are healthy for you and won‚Äôt cause chronic illnesses. In this app, canola oil and vegetable oil(which are both seed oils) are labeled as good. These seed oils are not good for you by any means. Seed oils cause cancer, heart disease, obesity, and many other chronic illnesses. I am very disappointed that an app like this is promoting this. I will be deleting this app."
5,Pen Art√≠st,"I know the barcode business isn‚Äôt new, but I love how you guys made it easy and insightful.   I was recommended to this app by a YouTuber named ‚ÄúThe Truth Is‚Äù. He exposes and acknowledges the detrimental effects of our government, cultural icons, and symbols of society.   He mentioned your app makes it easy to stay safe from predator companies poisoning us for profit, which is clearly ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô. Much love to you guys, and blessings to y‚Äôall for looking out for the consumer. I pray your pockets stay full ü•Ç"
5,Mr. Chef Luke,This app has significantly transformed my shopping experience. I cannot express enough positive feedback regarding this app. It is imperative that we address the need for substantial changes in food production by manufacturers. The current food options available in the United States are contributing to serious health issues and obesity. I sincerely appreciate Yuka for their efforts in creating awareness and promoting change. Let us work together to drive meaningful transformation.
5,LuvtheLake67,"My daughter told me about this app and how it has changed the way she now shops.  Items she thought were healthy, and that she was paying top dollar for, she was finding out were awful to have!  Our whole family now shops using the app and it‚Äôs amazing how our lives have changed (and how it‚Äôs saved us money too). I highly recommend downloading it and using it as soon as you can. It really will be ‚Äúeye opening‚Äù to you."
4,Mboe,"This app has become my Go To for determining if what I‚Äôm currently using or what I‚Äôm considering buying is the best option. Thanks for that. If I were to give some constructive feedback it would be that the orientation is locked and that‚Äôs a real pain.  I plug in my iPad when it‚Äôs in the stand and it has to be upside down because the plug doesn‚Äôt actually fit through the hold in the stand designed for that.  ANYWAY, that the app won‚Äôt adapt to the orientation I want/need to use seems like lazy programming."
3,Annmbv,"All of the products that I scanned were highly rated, contained good ingredients and were customer favorites. They were products I have used and had good results with, for a few years. For some odd reason, they all score a poor rating, and the app‚Äôs recommended products which were also given positive reviews, had more questionable ingredients than were in the products I had scanned. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. Ppl should use their own common sense. The app has a good premise, but needs to be tweaked a bit."
5,Fed up29,I absolutely love this app! I just have one question or critique? Why is it that the carbohydrate content is not listed or taken into consideration when scoring a product? I always look for the carb  and sugar content in nutrition labels as I am trying to eat low carb foods. So I was just curious as to why the total carb content of a food item is not considered for its rating?  Thank you so much for all you do. This is a fantastic tool and a must have!!!
3,MoniqueHTX,"I've been using the app since last year. I was happy with it at first. My issue is that some of the items I scanned last year and showed up excellent now all of a sudden are bad. 3x it happened. Those that were excellent I marked them as favorites and just by chance I looked through my list of ""favorites"" and found these items went from excellent to bad. I've been reading all ingredients on items I purchase in the last 30 years, some results in the app surprised me. Just take whatever the app tells you with a grain of salt."
5,wgyst1247,"Love this app!!! I use it every time I go to get my groceries. There are so many artificial ingredients or harmful ingredients that are unknown to the to the common person, if  they‚Äôre harmful or not. Yuka allows me to decide if those ingredients are OK for me to ingest or put on my skin. There have been quite a few items I was shocked to see were unhealthy that I always thought were healthy. Yuka also gives recommendations for alternative products to replace the ones that are unhealthy."
5,Missysalinas0,"I am obsessed with this app. If you are trying to make healthier choices, this app is super convenient in helping to guide you into the right direction!  When I grocery shop, I always have my app open and ready to start scanning before putting things into my cart. I also love that you can have some preferences set up. So if you‚Äôre avoiding gluten, it will show you if it‚Äôs gluten free or not which is really nice. Sometimes we miss things in that ingredient list.   RECOMMENDATION FOR THE APP: I would really like to be able to see the nutrition label and ingredient list myself as well on the app. There are a few things that Yuka doesn‚Äôt warn you about like Seed Oils or other specific ingredients. So it would be nice if it would show you all of that info.   Overall, HIGHLY recommend. An amazing app to have."
5,Monique/Holistic Practitioner,"This is a must have! Even if you are just starting your journey, you need this app. I have been reading labels for about 2 years now and it is just overwhelming to have to look up the unfamiliar ingredients. This app not only breaks down the ingredients but also provides scientific sources of their finding. If a product is not in their database, you can add it and with my experience within hours it will be added to the app."
5,addyochoo,In the world we live in today we are constantly being feed chemicals in the things we eat and the products we use. This app has made it so easy to finally know what chemical are bad and need to be avoided so you don‚Äôt have to memorize it yourself. I love that when you scan something bad it gives recommendation on replacements. The only thing is I wish it had a wider range then just food and cosmetics. Still a must have app
5,pattysur,"We absolutely love this app!!  Had to dispose of things that I have used for years, but happy to do it!! I recommend this app to everyone. You will be shocked what is in the food you eat and beauty products you use everyday. First time we went to the grocery store we spent 3 hrs scanning.  üòÇ Genius App!! Well worth the download. You will not be disappointed!! Interesting is the fact that many of the older and cheaper products are better and cleaner."
5,1)65fg,"This app works quickly and makes decisions on food purchases much easier. Remember people: you don‚Äôt have to eat only food in the Excellent category. It‚Äôs moderation. If something you love falls in the bad category, we‚Äôll don‚Äôt eat it everyday. So the worse something is for you, we‚Äôll maybe only once Or twice a month. Get what I mean? Don‚Äôt be obsessed with only Excellent rated Items. Remember to live a little! Enjoy the app. It‚Äôs really freaking neat!"
5,DebbieSt. Louis,This app is so helpful in determining which foods and products are safer choices. I signed up for the premium version and love it. I‚Äôve only been a member for a few days but I‚Äôm going through my house and scanning everything. It‚Äôs so very sad how many products I‚Äôve been consuming and using that contain Hazardous ingredients. BUT‚Ä¶.NOW I KNOW and can make a CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  Thank you for putting me on the path to Better Health!!! Debbie
5,Puppy121212,"I love this app. So much faster and easier than reading the labels, which are often small and hard to read for me. It has helped me make better choices when trying to pick which item to buy. I  always feel good when I can find a highly rated sauce with low sodium! I also like how easy it is to add local products and get a rating for it. I use this app so much when grocery shopping!!"
5,N9OLA,I appreciate having Yuka. I am a University of Illinois Master Gardener and Master Food Preserver; and University of Florida Master Beekeeper. On my 2 acre property I have gardened organically since 1988. I teach likewise. I mentor a young family in gardening and beekeeping. The mother is French with a 5 year old and Father is a corporate jet pilot. Her family from France came to USA this summer and her sister visited my property. Our food supply has many many unhealthy products. Yuka helps me in purchasing. Welcome to USA and what you are doing for us. Jerry
1,sarah.lynne.bell,"This app is extremely off. I‚Äôve done experimenting with it. It seems they are being paid by corporations to rate certain items better and certain items not. I scanned my protein oatmeal in which I know all ingredients, levels, and they are all healthy and good for you. Rated it a 2/100. Yet it suggests Gatorade as healthy. Which it is well known it is not. I‚Äôve tested it on multiple items and it‚Äôs actually shocking and inaccurate. I highly encourage people to try this. Scan an actual healthy item from a smaller brand, it will be labeled as ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Ä¶ then scan a big name brand of something you know is bad for you, and see the score be higher. What a scam."
5,Tbenaustin,I was introduced to this app a couple weeks ago and I use it each time I go to the store. I‚Äôm blown away by so many items I thought were healthy choices that actually weren‚Äôt at all OMG! This app has helped me to make better choices. I‚Äôm still a work in progress but at least now I‚Äôm being more conscious about what I buy. So thank you to all the creators of this app who want a healthier life and environment for us all.
5,Ryan ghhwjjvwhsu,The beauty and food industry use deceptive marketing that confuses the consumer and tries to convince us that the items they sell to us everyday are healthy and safe. I use this app everyday and didn‚Äôt realize how many products I was using were filled with harmful and banned additives. Highly recommend. This app gives power back to the consumer and hopefully will encourage manufacturers to change their ways.
2,Heatherwens,The app started crashing a few months ago. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it would not stay open. I updated when an update was released but that did not help. I let my subscription lapse and deleted the app. I reinstalled the app last week and renewed my subscription thinking that the bugs were probably fixed by now but the app keeps crashing. I‚Äôve tried to delete and reinstall but that had not helped. I will open the app and it will close after 5 seconds. I cannot click on anything or scan anything. Very disappointed.
5,JBToodotoh,"I love knowing what I‚Äôm eating! There have been a few surprises (all Instant Oatmeal is NOT the same!) and it‚Äôs so easy to use! I take Yuka with me shopping, and the garbage food doesn‚Äôt even come home with me.  The Big Food industry has a marketing machine to convince us to eat junk that they‚Äôve described as so-called ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù This humble little App is our defense to protect our bodies against the sugar and chemicals and other garbage that‚Äôs killing us.  An informed consumer is a healthy consumer."
5,411Knowledge is Power,"We donated so that we could use the search function. It‚Äôs been way easier in helping our family to choose better and healthier options. And possibly eliminate some foods we shouldn‚Äôt be consuming.  What would put this app over the top, in my opinion, would be recipes/meals in the alternative recommendation section. I know that might take some time to add, but it would be very helpful and appreciated!"
5,Honors World History,"I love this app. Now every time I go to buy a cosmetic product, I can scan it to see what the ingredients really are. Manufacturers don‚Äôt like educated customers because it just means less business for them. But I‚Äôd rather be educated about what I‚Äôm putting on my skin, hair, etc. and not give business to the manufacturers who put harsh/harmful chemicals in their products!! definitely buy this app if you want a safe skincare/body care/haircare routine."
5,Just Another PotterHead,"I‚Äôve been using Yuka since 2021, and this app is amazing. You can scan an item your wiling to buy and see what is in it and how It tanks on toxicity to you. 0/100 being the worst. Now this app doesn‚Äôt just willy nilly, on ranking THEY GO IN DEATAIL about what these chemicals are and how they are harmful. This app has made me mindful on what I‚Äôm putting on my skin, in my mouth and in body. This app is ESSENTIAL!   Thank you so much Yuka creators this app is amazing and truly important in our modern world."
5,Miladybug,"I recently learned about Yuka and I am incredibly impressed (I am embarrassed to admit that it‚Äôs hard to impress me.) There are so many foods and products I have been using that are incredibly bad. I so wish I‚Äôd learned about this along time ago. They also email articles that are so articulate and complete, it is amazing. I urge everyone to download this app, and also to subscribe to the very low cost premium package which will help to support them. Yes, a winner!"
5,Chicago central,"I‚Äôm thoroughly thought I was Eating Healthy Good Food. Being a Truck Driver by Day, cycling 75 miles weekly! Having Little Time to Read the back of every item, then when you Do, there‚Äôs still ingredients, not listed! Premium Membership includes Search Engine box, History, works offline , once a connection is restored it updates what was not included to your History. INDEPENDENT -no big Brother- Game Changer!  Why haven‚Äôt you Downloaded it Already?"
5,NatiB.C,"My sister-in-law showed me this app, and since day one, I've been forever changed and blown away. This app makes it so much easier to look up products you have or thinking of buying. It would take me forever to read and look up each ingredient in anything, and this is just one scan away. I am telling everyone on my social media to get this app ASAP! Know what you are ingesting and putting on your body."
5,Klyn S,"My family uses this app for all of our food/ health product purchases. We‚Äôve made a commitment to find safer products and healthier food for our young kids after learning what garbage was in the foods we ate growing up. This app has changed how we live our lives. I am equally excited about the call out option, which is new, and I believe an incredible tool to promote real change from food companies!"
5,Brynes,"This app has helped me make a lot better choices in regards to what to use and what to avoid for food and beverages or things you use on your body (soap, deodorant, etc.) Very intuitive and useful. Highly recommend and I‚Äôm always showing this app to my friends so they can make better choices and avoid harmful things as well. Hands down easily one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever seen and utilized on the App Store. Total game changer. A+"
5,Echoisgreen,The more I use this app the more I learn! It‚Äôs very descriptive and detailed. I‚Äôm glad that people cared enough to create an app like this. Super grateful. Haven‚Äôt found any issues with it yet. Only suggestion would be under each product if it lists which stores commonly carry the product just so I can find the good stuff more easily (but that‚Äôs more for my convenience and has less to do with the app‚Äôs purpose)
5,Bryon1111,"You are my #1 favorite app on my phone. You allow me to walk around a grocery store and make good decisions in 5 seconds that would otherwise take 5 minutes. Thank you for improving my health, saving me time, and helping me ‚Äúvote‚Äù with my purchases! I really believe your app is making the world a better place, and - hopefully - will pressure food producers to use better ingredients for all of our well-being."
5,KimmyBradley,"This app has changed my household completely! We now scan all of our products that we want to buy at the grocery store before we purchase it. With this app, I can stay out of any hazardous risk in all of our health journeys and for a lifetime. A lot of times we eat what we buy without knowing 100% what‚Äôs inside. Very thankful for this app, just shared it on my feed to Facebook. Hopefully it can save more lives!"
5,22Laine23,Excellent for a quick look at what‚Äôs good or bad but you have to see what makes it good or bad for instance I almost threw out organic coconut oil because it said it was bad because of the high saturated fat! Well that‚Äôs a given I thought there was something really wrong with it so I had to take a lot of stuff out of the garbage and see what was making it bad. Also Campbell‚Äôs pork and beans has 7 g of added sugar and it says it‚Äôs excellent. Not too sure that one
5,Eli8086,"Discovering the Yuka app has transformed my life by revealing the truth about the ingredients in my food and cosmetics üò¨. I love that it provides clear ratings, empowering informed decisions and leading to healthier choices. Yuka is very user friendly and you can decide how much you want to contribute to their mission by becoming member starting form a $1. Yuka has become an indispensable tool for taking control of my health. If you care about what you consume and use, Yuka is a must-have app ü§©"
4,Jsinns,"This app is amazing but could use some improvements. What I would suggest is adding a feature where you look up the food or product and add it to the foods or items  you ate/ used today, yesterday, or in the future. I find it really good that this App is not swayed by big companies and or the money but rather help the people find out what they are putting into their body. Especially with all the chemicals and ingredients that‚Äôs in everything these days."
5,JudyAnnR,"I have been using Yuka for about 3 months now, mainly to eat healthier. I have been quite impressed with all of it (mostly the ease of use and the recommendations feature).  I would gladly give it 10 stars if you could add Carbs. Protein, Fats, Sugar, and Sodium are all numbers I look but being able to see total carbs would enable me to make balanced choices all in one app. I think you all have done a wonderful job helping us to be healthier!"
5,_NataliaHills_,"This app transformed my life :) I went through my whole bathroom, pantry and fridge, and got rid of 70% of what I was using and putting on my face and inside my body. So eye-opening - how many hazardous ingredients have all those products we use to buy. Shopping process now changed completely - I scan every single thing and only buy what‚Äôs good for me and my body. I paid for a yearly subscription and it‚Äôs such a good value. What a great app!"
4,ReedMikel,"A database of 2 million foods - wonderful!  As a software developer, I see so much more opportunity to leverage this app.  e.g. a meal diary where I could first define a common thing I eat (english muffin with peanut butter and half banana this morning).  Once my common meals are defined (made up of items in the Yuka database), it becomes a simple task to record my meals every day.  App could then show the overall health (or lack of) of my meals each day.  Incorporate glycemic index/load values of everything we eat etc‚Ä¶"
5,idlcmfic,"This app is amazing and we‚Äôve transformed our purchasing habits and have a home full of healthy and safe products compared to the poisons and endocrine disrupters that we had previously because we were uninformed, so thank you for all you do. Please check in with Apple, I‚Äôve tried to tell people about the app and it appears to be shadow banned in the App Store. Luckily I can click the share icon in my App Store purchases."
5,wasabily,"What I like: - it explains everything in a way that even people not an expert in nutrition or chemical field can understand easily.  - the database is huge that I can almost find everything so far.  - user interface is cute and color tone is also very nice that I enjoy using it.  What I wish to be improved: - Taiwan is not supported to use it. What a pity! Cosmetics and life style are super trending in Taiwan now. Please support it soon  - When sending mail within App, it requires iOS user to use default Apple mail app. I use gmail all the time and I don‚Äôt want to re-install Apple mail only to send the feedback/report problem. Please support send message via installed mail app or within app directly.  Well done team! Thank you for making this app!"
5,Candlemannj,Nothing is more important than your health and this has been my go to app whenever I do shopping. It‚Äôs amazing. Items that I thought were healthy based on the name or the labels turned out to be anything but. So I use this as my filter tell me avoid poor foods and now with the new service of letting you know the best pics in that particular item this app has become essential to me.
5,s_wiss13,I am so happy to have found this app. I have wanted to make better decisions about my food choices and this app is exactly what I needed. The ease of scanning a product to understand the ingredients is perfect. I use this on everything I buy. The first day we cleaned out many things that contained additives and replaced them with healthier choices. I especially appreciate the alternatives that the app provides. Thank you.
5,Johnny Appleseed 12,"This app is useful to parse out the long ingredient lists in food. Often times foods are labeled as healthy, but contain additives (some which are BANNED in Europe). This app provides transparency to allow you to make an informed decision.   Some reviewers seem to take the ratings scale in this app a bit too seriously. This app should not be used as a final authority for dietary or health decisions. Please consult a health professional for that.   Overall 5/5, keep up the good work devs."
1,suetenner,"I went to organic stores, drugstores and grocery stores, and scanned as many hair products as I could with this app. Apparently, every single shampoo and conditioner out there is bad. I did not find one, not even a one even at a beauty supply store, that said it was good. Although I believe that there are a lot of hair products out there that have bad ingredients in them, they can‚Äôt all be bad. Even the ones that say that they are free of parabens and silicone and all that, Yuka says they‚Äôre bad I am challenging you to list the shampoos and conditionersand hair products that you think are good because I haven‚Äôt found a one on your app."
5,Ghyto22,"This app is almost too good to be true!  Everyone should download it and use it every time you go to the market, like I do.  I no longer have to stand there reading the nutrition labels and doing all the math in my head.  Now I have my own saved list of all the healthy products I buy regularly, and use the app for any products I‚Äôm unfamiliar with.  The only reason I gave you guys 5 stars is because there aren‚Äôt 6!"
5,Edwaq582,About 90% of the products I‚Äôve been using had carcinogens and other bad things in them that I thought were good for me! Learning just because it‚Äôs expensive and says it‚Äôs doing good for you it can actually be doing the complete opposite. So glad my sister recommended me this app and I‚Äôm glad I found it not too late in my life. I def will be scanning everything I buy from now on!
5,KelaineS,"Thank you Lord for such an amazing app. I never leave reviews, but this app truly needed attention. I have told so many family members and friends about this app. Thank you all for all your efforts to make this app. I already knew about so many bad ingredients in things. But this app just made it a bit easier. So if your on the fence whether or not to get this app. I say get it and try it you will be such a great tool to have.   God Bless  Karen"
5,Lexi the Llama,"I always try to buy healthy & clean products but I must say, I never truly researched what was really in my products. This app is wonderful, it does the work for you so you have live a healthier & cleaner life! I will forever have this app & I‚Äôm a bit jealous I didn‚Äôt think of coming up with an app like this sooner. I discovered that literally ALL of my hygiene products that I use weren‚Äôt good at all, this app helped open my eyes a bit."
1,NY Andrew,"I like how they FORCE you to create an account to harvest your data THEN first thing I do is go to do a search and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, REQUIRES A MEMBERSHIP!!!!! Gets better. Says ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù ok I can get down with that, but then they FORCE YOU TO MAKE A SELECTION OF THREE OPTIONS!!!! How is that, ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù if I have to choose an option!? Slimy business practice all around. Just do your own research. It‚Äôs honestly not that hard. Over time you‚Äôll build memory of what‚Äôs good and bad as far as ingredients go anyway and keeps your brain sharp. No shortcuts in life unless you wanna bend over and pay. Disappointed and will be sharing this negative experience everywhere."
5,mgdbyy,"I love this app it‚Äôs helped me to be more healthy I check everything I buy and eat and it‚Äôs helpful to have beauty product reviews also But I wish it would be able to go on an Apple Watch so when I don‚Äôt have my phone and I have my watch, I could scan it still but overall, I love the app. I do wish she wouldn‚Äôt have to be a member to look up products but it‚Äôs still very very helpful. 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è"
5,Laura Sally,"My son, who is very health conscious, told me about this app and I love it! I use it every time I grocery shop; it helps me to make better/healthier choices of what I buy! I‚Äôve learned that foods I once thought wasn‚Äôt that bad for us, IS BAD FOR US. Now, I only buy things that scan ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. I also love that it shows what the positives and negatives are in the item you scan, and no manufacturer or brand sponsors this app, YUKA is a 100% independent project!"
5,__‚ÄîSAS‚Äî__,"I was thinking of an app that can scan barcodes and tell me what products are the best for you, as i was walking down the aisle in a supermarket, sure enough when I searched online I found out it already exists and I downloaded it on the spot, it was helpful in choosing what‚Äôs for breakfast the next morning. It‚Äôs informative and has good recommendations on choosing the right food would definitely recommend it.  üíØ"
5,Jplaynyc,"My daughter has severe eczema, and has broken out in rashes repeatedly, but she‚Äôs also a teenager who is obsessed with beauty products. Yuka has made it so simple to check for her allergens in products. I use EWG a lot, but for toiletries and cosmetics Yuka is far superior. I didn‚Äôt even know you could scan food products, I‚Äôll be trying that immediately.  One suggestion: don‚Äôt top out at your $18 donation. I would‚Äôve given more."
5,MomWma,"I can quit spending untold amounts of time googling ingredients!!!!  Limiting chemicals, dyes, sugar, salt, artificial anything and preservatives just got easy. The hard part?  Americas groceries are garbage!!!!  Hard to find decent food but this app helps us keep things on the shelf where they belong and not in our cart. We just turn it and scan it. If it‚Äôs scored unacceptable we walk away.  I almost wish it gave off a mean sounding alarm when things rate bad üòÜ"
5,Life-Natural,I am very pleased that this app was developed for us consumers.  Now I can see the hidden ingredients and understand the the effects of each one.    The color labeling makes it easy to know what to stay away from and love that the app provides healthy alternative suggestions.   I am more health conscious now on the ingredients of the products I buy either it‚Äôs food or beauty.  I scan all my products now before buying.
5,mfnb3,"This app will not only help people be and stay healthy but I hope it also helps get bad products off the market. If the manufacturers were half as thoughtful as the people who did this app maybe we‚Äôd get somewhere. I‚Äôve also found some of the recommendations to be better and less money. Not always the case but I‚Äôd rather spend now on good, safe products then later on medical care from illness‚Ä¶"
5,Gramdma loves Jesus,"So far this app is all I had hoped for. Even though some ratings feel like a low blow. Honestly it is a wonder I personally,haven‚Äôt turned into the proverbial ‚Äòpillar of salt‚Äô by now, from all the sodium in food. Not to mention the preservatives, which are staggering. It might be helpful if this could analyze the packaging for us, too, lol. But maybe not ü§î, because that knowledge might give us all strokes sooner rather than later!"
4,ProjectJSL1782,"While this is a handy app to have to check for bad chemical ingredients, it misses the bar by not calling out seed oils and giving things like an ultra-processed peanut butter a Good Score and an all natural, grass fed beef stick a poor score due to fat content. A nice feature to add would be the ability to select foods as allergens (you could add seed oils here for example) and have them scan and do the reviews with that in mind. Otherwise, fantastic app. Downloaded it after I heard about it on Joe Rogans podcast."
5,BarbMacCrate,"I use this app every time I try something new. I've even shared it with people looking at ingredients in the store.  Sometimes the score is low on a product but I can make the decision if the reason it is low is due to, say, calorie content, which is not a big factor for me. The additives category is something very important to me and to find out that some of those additives are dangerous is such a plus!"
5,Aks26,"This app is amazing! Started using it out of curiosity- but now I scan everything I eat and all cosmetics at home and at the store. The way it is organized and displayed is so easy to use and understand, and has helped me make more conscious decisions about what I eat and what I use on a daily basis. I‚Äôve been telling everyone I know to get this app! Thank you to the makers for creating this helpful tool!"
4,ClaudeJackson,"I love this app showing harmful additives especially. I will I had it 50 years ago but of course that wasn‚Äôt possible. I might have saved myself bowel perforations, prostate cancer and subsequent radiation damages and side effects but not eating garbage and using harmful products.  I wish I didn‚Äôt have to add an item back to my favorites if I scan it again though. You should already see it‚Äôs In your favorites after you scan it again."
5,Snugglebuni,"I just became a premium member. This app has been a real eye opener especially on food items marked as hazardous. It gives a detailed description of what are the contents in the food products that contain additives that can be harmful to one‚Äôs health. The rating of excellent, good, poor and bad are very helpful. Processed foods typically are not good for our health. Anything in a bag, a box or a can should be the rule of thumb as they are the ones that contain most of the harmful additives."
5,Floatingpotsie,"Absolutely love this app.  I was completely overwhelmed with trying to help my family eat better and this simplifies things SO much.  However, I would LOVE it if the app would add a feature so you could set it to rate according to what is important to you and your health needs.  For example, I actually require higher sodium so that rating isn‚Äôt important to me, however I really want to eliminate any additives."
5,caolin72,This has been a great app to find out about the harmful ingredients in a variety of things. I have told several friends about it and they love it too. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt get subsidized by any brand and is totally free from bias is the most import fact for me.  Other apps are influenced by receiving support from manufacturers. I hope you continue to expand the database of products and keep up the good work!
5,ladi3sman216,"I‚Äôll start this by saying that I‚Äôm not a bot and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever written a review before because I found it unnecessary but once I tried this app I was instantly in LOVE, I‚Äôm a health nut and it‚Äôs a lifesaver. It tells you everything you need to know about what you‚Äôre looking at to buy down to the molecular level it‚Äôs crazy. I had to instantly write a review I hope you guys find this app as useful as me because its a real game changer ."
4,stretch_tastik!,"I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm blown away and kicking myself for not utilizing this app earlier! Protect these developers at ALL COST!!! My kids now use this app to help with allergies and sensitivities to certain foods and ingredients‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very appreciative of how easy this app is to use and how it relays such important data in a very good, easy way to understand and use on everyday products that well, let‚Äôs face it, slowly kill us. I highly highly recommend this app and send many many THANKS to the creators!!!  üíØüëåü§ô"
5,MitchBuys,"hello,  I want to become a subscriber. but i want to ask first, in the ‚ÄúFood Preference‚Äù feature, is there a coconut oil option? i am detagly allergic to it, and wondering if you have it there or you can add it? I tried sending a medsage via your contact page on website but it is giving an error each time that syas ‚Äú There was an error trying to send your message. Please try again later.‚Äù. Thanks"
5,This Life of Faith,"When you want to start making healthier choices but don‚Äôt have hours to spend researching products, this app does it for you.   I would love if they would list the ingredient Annatto as so many kids have reactions to it. Their bodies respond the same way as other synthetic dyes. This would help out so many families who have to comb through ingredients labels to ensure they are not giving this ingredient to their children."
4,valvdvd,"I love this app so much I have a premium subscription to support them. I have a few suggestions that would make this app perfect for me: - let us look up ingredients by one or a whole list, not just products.  -let us choose our own grading system, for example I don‚Äôt care about allergens and sometimes it‚Äôs the only thing bringing down a product‚Äôs score.  -let us make ‚Äúcollections‚Äù for our saved/favorite items."
5,Valori W,"I absolutely love this app. I just have to scan it and it‚Äôll tell me whether or not it is good or bad, and it gives me recommendations for something better. It also tells me the reasons why one of my products is bad. I also love how you get to choose how much you want to pay for the membership to search up products and it tries to make it as affordable as possible. I love this app, it is super helpful!! It‚Äôs free too! :)"
5,Jessica Bittmann,"I have always thought that the food industry is probably corrupt, but I‚Äôve been paralyzed by knowing how to research, where to begin. I‚Äôve never known how to make consistent changes until Yuka. This app has seriously empowered me to make changes in the way I grocery shop. I can finally prioritize buying food with no additives without feeling overwhelmed at doing all the research myself."
5,Blellb1324,"Overall great and really enjoy using it. The females in my household also like the ability to utilize it for their skin care, make up, and hair care items as well. While I disagree on how certain fats and seed oils are viewed the overall app details and breakdown info of full ingredients and potential dangers or hazards of those ingredients should be seen as a net positive in helping people make healthier and wiser purchases, and be supported."
5,birkie9,As a first time mom we try our hardest to make healthy choices for our kiddos! Swapping out certain snacks for a healthier option. It‚Äôs great to have whilst shopping being able to scan each product to see which is the better option. I REALLY wish it had a category for metals!  We all know that a lot of baby foods have lead in them and that would be a great factor for this app to have.
3,such vbjczgb,"This app has a number of bad recommendations, labeling plenty of ingredients with a plethora of reaserch debunking old alarmist claims-for example monosodium glutamate (which has actually been shown to have a number of benefits but was railroad during a wave of anti-Asian hate in the 1900s) and certain food colorings (which have been proven over and over again NOT to cause adhd, again just a speculative rumor)   This WHILE labeling ‚Äúclean‚Äù ingredients with just as much IF NOT MORE research showing their potential harms as ‚Äúgood‚Äù For example stevia, which despite being natural‚Äô has been shown to be a likely carcinogenic, as a better alternative to Sucralose. An ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô sweetener which has been shown to have no negative effects at regular doses   I suspect public perception of a food plays a much bigger role in the so called evidence based scoring system, which is a shame because this concept is really fantastic"
3,Jkbogle,"This app is pretty useful overall the difficulties lie in missing key ingredients that are detrimental to human health like hi fructose corn syrup, or fluoride. Other thing it seems to look over is SEED oils like canola, vegetable, soy bean oil, and peanut oil. Artificial sweeteners like maltodextrin, sucralose, and agave are just a few more to add to this list. The common denominator between the seed oil‚Äòs and the artificial sweeteners happens to be with the chemical process used and the chemicals involved to create these ingredients. Another area that‚Äôs lacking would be supplements and laundry detergent, soap.  Definitely helpful app."
5,Tesalala,"I‚Äôm giving 5 stars but I do have one small suggestion. For my lifestyle I don‚Äôt really need to count calories in order to maintain my weight, so calories aren‚Äôt really an issue for me. That being said, it‚Äôs be nice if there was an option to not have calories negatively impact a foods score. I‚Äôd like scores more relevant to my preferences/needs. I could see something like ‚Äúcontains dairy‚Äù as being more relevant for me, for example."
5,Bertapoo,"I am absolutely shocked at how many of my beauty/personal products contain harmful chemicals that I thought was said to be organic or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. Yuka, I thank you for caring enough to make this app accessible to everyone and providing us with potentially life saving technology. Moving forward, my app will be open and ready whenever I‚Äôm in the store. It‚Äôs absolutely insane how these products are even able to reach the shelves."
4,CurryTiff,"Great app! Consider changing the way you frame calories, as many nutritious foods are naturally high in calorie and fats (olive oil). Perhaps instead of labeling these foods that would have otherwise scored higher as having a ‚Äúhigh amount of healthy fat‚Äù or simply stating calorie/fat amounts without a rating of good/bad.   Actually, I feel that rating of food should be heavily based on carcinogenic ingredients/sourcing methods/emission levels. Nutrition is so subjective and the factors listed above are of more importance in the long run."
5,nolongerscammed,"I am so happy to have discovered this app. So many ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù things I had been buying, especially for the children; only to find out through this app that they are not ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù at all. I especially love that it gives you alternatives to buy instead. That it is sited, and goes into detail to why, is what really makes this a 5 star app that everyone should have on hand!"
5,Daria_ya,"I absolutely love the Yuka app! It has made choosing products with good ingredients so much easier. This app has saved me so much time and effort. I used to research every single ingredient and google everything‚Äîit was such a process! But now, everything is so much simpler. Whether it‚Äôs picking the right shampoo or finding a detangling product for my daughter, Yuka helps me make the best choices. Love you guys, thank you for what you do!"
5,Alexandra Lallave,"This is a great app! This app scans any products such as food and beauty! I struggle a lot especially to eat healthy foods, especially living in America. With Yuka, I am able to scan any food product and it tells me in good detail what‚Äôs unhealthy and healthy about the product. I genuinely cannot stress to you how great this app is.  I truly hope this app stays free, it‚Äôs a truly useful app. I definitely recommend installing:)!"
5,SueBeazer,I am so amazed at how much using Yuka made for us.  My husband and I went up and down all the isles looking at at all our items.  I am ore diabetic and have to make changes in my diet. Using  Yuka helped to pick better choices. Plus it was fun to do. Win/win. Try it once and you‚Äôll me hooked. We came home and went through our pantry too.  So amazing to see the ratings . My husband‚Äôs reactions made me laugh.
5,Lemony Melanie,"My entire family uses the Yuka app, it is so helpful making wise choices ! I cleaned out my pantry after finding ingredients that are hazardous when I thought I had made healthy foods. I actually signed up for the $15 annual subscription so I can type in foods and beauty and makeup products even if I don‚Äôt have them in front of me. Thank you for this wise app for helping us stay healthy and safe!"
5,delightful denny,"The information that we have been learning about the various products that we typically use has been a real eye-opener! We have been using the app to review products we‚Äôve been using for years and finding out that they‚Äôre very unhealthy. The great thing is, is that we‚Äôre provided with choices. The information provided is knowledge and knowledge allows us to make wise and healthy decisions!"
4,ashmrob,"I love this app. I have switched to many healthier foods and products. However, I just wish it was more consistent with ratings. A product will rate ‚Äúgood‚Äù or higher and then there will be the same duplicate product rated ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. I also wish there was a list to access with bad ingredients to be able to reference when looking at labels. Otherwise, I recommend this app to everyone and love knowing I‚Äôm making healthier choices!"
5,@icanhazcateyez,"Absolutely LOVE the app, but wish it could be incorporated as a plug in for the browser when I am shopping on Amazon/Walmart/Target/Ulta and the like. Would also be great if it showed the rating on the side when searching for a particular type of product without having to click on each item since I typically want to keep my products in the range of 90+ rating."
5,Agt127,"This app is my holy grail for everything! It makes me feel more aware and safe when choosing what products to buy so I know what I am putting in my body. The only downside is shopping now takes 2x as long because I scan EVERYTHING lol üòÇ. I wish every feature was free on here but for what you do get for free it‚Äôs so worth it. Thank you for making this app, it puts my mind at ease when shopping. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,wallstte,"This app will show you the good and bad food out there. Sad that here in America we continue to add additives that are bad for our health but as know our additives are banned in other countries. This app is will show and tell you what it is and why it‚Äôs bad for you. Also does cosmetics too, remember what you put on your body gets absorbed into your body. 5 stars all the way around, highly recommend downloading this app."
5,Tttyyylllreeerrr,"This is the MOST important app you can have if you care about your health and longevity. They break down the ingredients in every food or cosmetic item and describe to you what its used for, and what it does to your or even the environment. I highly recommend. Also if you scan products that are REALLY bad, they give you a humorous answer. Straight up : Download and use this app, and tell your loved ones about it too."
5,Chrisfury!,"This app is so useful to be able to quickly scan products, super simple and easy to read, love how you all put in the effort to even talk about the bad additives that the average consumer has no clue about, and I love the recommended other options for the poor and bad products! Totally recommend this to anyone who wants to eat healthier, and doesn‚Äôt know where to start at the grocery store."
2,Brishney,"I got this app mostly out of curiosity. While the ingredients aspect is accurate, the way they are presented is more about scaring people than being informative. Firstly, it will tell you that a drink with 5 calories is ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù and lists it as a negative. Secondly, it will tell you scientific names for ingredients and then claim that they are more dangerous than they actually are. I‚Äôve just noticed a lot of inconsistency with how the app addresses certain ingredients. It really looks as though the app is trying to instill unnecessary fear in consumers. If you were to live by this app you would never eat anything ever."
5,CarrieB18,"Whether it is food, shampoo, hair spray, hand cream or other ‚Äòbeauty products‚Äô products, know that your skin absorbs toxins into your body. I will now use this app to scan & see if it is an unhealthy item, filled with toxic preservatives before I buy it! This app even provides a healthy substitute for what you might currently be using. Change your habits, improve your life‚ù£Ô∏è Huge kudos to this developer. Spread the word. App is so easy to use."
5,Jazmynejt,"To be and informed consumer is to feel empowered. I had changed my eating habits so many times trying to feed me and my family ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods. After downloading Yuka I realized how many marketing traps I fell into. Now there‚Äôs full transparency in my purchases and I‚Äôm forever grateful. My app is open and ready with every food, body  and hair care product I purchase and I tell anyone who will listen about the app. Love love love!!"
5,ColoRebecca,This app is amazing! We have tried to get cleaner and safer products for years only to find out some of the things I thought were safe had questionable chemicals in them. I love that this app tells me what‚Äôs in a product and I am able to do my own research to see how I feel about it. I have not recommended an app since Waze and I am recommending Yuka to everyone.
5,Allen Girl 2013,"I love this app and I hate this app. I am surprised to find what I believed to be at least partly healthy to have ‚Äúdangerous‚Äùchemicals! Some foods I loved. No wonder we‚Äôre so unhealthy as a nation! And foods I didn‚Äôt think would be at all get a good rating. It is easy to use and the annual to go premium is negligible. I would encourage folks who are curious as to what they‚Äôre eating to try this app, I think you‚Äôll be surprised at the foods we consume."
5,Mahalo Nui Loa!,"Since my daughter told me about this app, it has totally changed how I shop for skin care. I am very sensitive to so many products and believe many I‚Äôve used over the years may have negatively effected my thyroid function. I‚Äôm hoping with this app, it will continue to help me refrain from using products detrimental to my health. Thank you so much for caring enough to help us use healthier alternatives!! God bless you!!"
5,Allorahz,"I use Yuka for EVERYTHING. You will see me in the grocery store scanning every item before I purchase it. My friends and family tease me, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because at least I know what I‚Äôm putting in and on my body.  I‚Äôve ditched so many bad foods and products that aren‚Äôt good for me and my health. Yuka is one of the best things that‚Äôs happened to me and has allowed me to make healthier choices in life. I will never stop using Yuka. ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂"
5,Ninacositas,"Thank you - for the creation of this app‚Ä¶ I used for a while as free, one day I was looking for a product by name, and it requested I buy the app- not asking for a crazy amount but a ‚Äúyou pick what the price is from a considerable amount‚Äù - this tells me the creators are conscious of the human need, and  they understand  the greed from the companies‚Ä¶ poisoning humans for profit.  This app has changed my life and the health of my family."
2,celine jeanne marie,"I just downloaded Yuka and used it for the first time in the store. I was looking at granola cereals. I scanned Purely Elizabeths berry crisp, ancient grain granola to which Yuka attributed a poor score (too much saturated fat and too much sugar 7 g). I should add that all the ingredients in Purely Elizabeth are organic. They use coconut oil, which is a medium chain fatty acid, recognized as one of the better type of fat to consume.  Instead, it suggested that I buy Quaker Simply Granola which is non-organic and contains 13 g of sugar per servings compared to 7 g for P.E. - and a bunch of nasty seed oils such as canola and soybean.  So maybe this is just a glitch. But at the moment I am underwhelmed."
5,Stephers910,"This app has been truly eye-opening for me. As somebody who has always taken pride in eating healthy, I have been very surprised to learn some of the foods I‚Äôve eaten for years are far from the best. Keep up the great work I don‚Äôt normally pay for a subscription for anything but I signed up to help you guys out and everybody else reading this should do the same to support your efforts! Thank you!"
5,Siara Anastasia,"My manager told me about this app and I can‚Äôt even explain to you what a game changer it‚Äôs been for me and my family.  We all ask ourselves when we see ingredients ‚Äòwhat is that monohdjsthssihe whatever‚Äô right.   Well this will tell you and help you on the journey of eating healthier.. or at least make you aware.  And if it is not a good choice, it‚Äôs going to give you healthier options to choose from‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüôèüôè"
5,She Rides,"Thankful for this wonderful FREE APP.  I never buy apps.  But this is so wonderfully informative, easy to use and really helpful. I love the recommendations.  When I find I have been using an unhealthy product... I am delighted to be given a list of similar products that are more healthful.  Additives are confusing.  I appreciate the simple explanations of what is risky.    I will become a member and pay for this App so others can learn ."
5,revieweruser1234,"After getting this app, I was amazed at what poor things I used to buy thinking it wasn‚Äôt all that bad when in reality it was worse. This app is a diet/body care improver! I scan everything I consume and cover my body with before buying it, and I am amazed at what horrible things I used to get for YEARS. Now, everything I eat and use is organic and fresh, and I feel so much better. Download Yuka now! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉ"
5,Greaguirre,"Honestly I was never into caring about the food I consumed. But I had my baby boy, and wanted to make sure all I ate was healthy and fresh, with no addictives added! Since I am breastfeeding.  This app has helped me so much, on not just the food but the products I purchase like lotions and detergents. Thank you so so much! Even just the free version of this app is amazing! Definitely going to purchase to have more options!üíô 10/10!!!!!"
4,albrougher,"Honestly I love this app. I was able to find healthy and safe shampoo/conditioner/ body wash for me and my kid. I love that it tells you what the harmful chemicals are and what they might cause. My one and only issue is that it doesn‚Äôt scan stuff like diapers, wipes, some baby foods, cleaning products, and supplements/vitamins. A lot of these things have a tendency to have harmful things in them and I would love to see those areas expand. Other than that, GET THIS APP!"
5,Pete & Joyce,"It is surprising to see how many products, many wealthy brand name companies, have the appearance of being healthy for you but are not. Advertising  can be so deceiving. ‚ÄúSelf Regulation‚Äù of most companies DOSES NOT WORK! Here is the proof. It‚Äôs a shame that we need this kind of App. Thank you for giving us the ability to self regulate the products we purchase, so we can make truly healthy choices for our families to use and eat! Pete & Joyce."
5,rymaie,"I downloaded this out of curiosity after seeing someone use it on TikTok. I was sure all of the good in-detail parts that I saw in the tiktok would be locked behind a paywall, but it‚Äôs not! It lets you scan, as promised, and the recommending better alternatives part that I thought would be a premium only thing is also free! I don‚Äôt see any downside to this app, and I‚Äôd definitely recommend."
5,jlrnmar2303,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP! seriously it has helped me decrease the amount of toxins in our food and house hold products. When I find clean products it helps me then determine which of the clean products is the healthiest for me. I had no idea how many harmful additives were in our food!  Trust me if you are on the fence about this app it has changed my life. Please download and support this app. Thank you and please keep updating and adding products!
5,russiannabarb,Amazing App. I would like to thank Yuka inventor for coming up with this application because it allowed me and also gave me a Knowledge that the expensive make up product I have been using for years causes thyroid problems and I have thyroid problems. Although there is some mistakes but I believe if we as a community come up and tell they will be able to fix these minor issues
3,lyssetic,I‚Äôm sorry I just can‚Äôt stand that in order to search products I have to pay a monthly fee.  Too many things these days cost a monthly membership fee and it‚Äôs really out of hand. I might sound like a boomer saying that but I would rather pay a one time price for the app rather than download it for free only to find I need to be a member to truly get what I want out of it. Deleted my account and gonna try to find something similar. Love the concept and general goal of the app though. Sorry guys :/
5,orange apple man ?,"I learned about Yuka from a Faze Rug video. I wanted to try I, so I downloaded it and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing! Now my grandparents, my best friend, and I are using this app everyday and we‚Äôre eating a lot healthier! But my brother and some others don‚Äôt use this app because they claim most foods are unhealthy, so they won‚Äôt be able to eat anything, which is not true! You should download this app now; you won‚Äôt regret it!"
5,calmmmmmmmm,"Thank you Yuka Team for being conscientious. And thank you even more for sharing this gem with the world. Anybody who cares about themselves and loves themselves need to download this app ASAP. I feel a difference, I see a difference. I share this app with everyone I come in contact with as it has truly changed my life. Thank you all again for the work you have done and the lives you‚Äôve impacted."
5,shakenbd,"I‚Äôve been using this app for months now and this is the one nutrition app that I consistently use all the time. I really don‚Äôt buy anything at the grocery store unless I scan it first. It even works on non-food items as well such as toothpaste. This app honestly feels too good to be true a lot of times for how simple, quick, and full of information it provides you."
5,Anlig,"I have been using this app for a while now when I go to the grocery store. I have always tried to purchase healthy items, But this app has shown me many things that are labeled ‚Äúhealthy‚Äú and even ‚Äúorganic‚Äú that contain hazards to my overall health. I feel like we can no longer really trust the nutrition labeling. I‚Äôm very thankful for this app."
4,Claudia i A,"I absolutely love the Yuka app and use it almost every day to check products for chemicals we should all avoid. When I discovered it over a year ago, I went through all my products and got rid of anything with poor or bad ratings. Your app is truly a blessing, helping to protect us from harmful chemicals that may be linked to cancer.  Please keep up the great work! I‚Äôm your biggest fan, and I‚Äôm so grateful to the person who introduced me to your app.  Claudia NYC SDF"
5,!@Blue@!,Thank you so much for having this app come to life. It‚Äôs has changed our life. My kids love it when we go food shopping. It helps them to understand why certain foods are more healthier than others. I love it and the fact that is also scans body care is great too.  Thank you again ‚Ä¶ the best thing ever created. I tell my family and friends about it all the time.
1,Fruit sugar is good for you!,"As a health expert (from personal and professional experience), this app has a lot of misinformation about what‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù food versus what‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor‚Äù or ‚Äúbad.‚Äù I eat whole food, plant based, and it was startling to me to see a heavily processed protein bar with additives receive a ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating when my all natural fruit and nut bar received a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù rating. This makes no sense. Fruit sugar is NOT the same as processed sugar and shouldn‚Äôt be treated as such. Unfortunately, because of this false information, I cannot trust this app to actually offer users the service it claims to."
1,Officially_maya_,"There are quite a few products that I know personally are very good yet. The app says that it‚Äôs bad. If you actually look at the ingredients that says that are bad, all that it does is give a very generic description that has nothing to do skin care more food. For example, CeraVe healing ointment I know is very good for the skin. It does not clog pores. Yet on the app it gives it 0 out of 100 saying that the petroleum jelly inside it has bad oils to ingest. I do not care about ingesting my face cream I only care about putting it on my face. So for those of you who go 100% by this app please do your research per ingredient that says is bad."
5,dailydilemma7,"My friend recommended this app to me and I‚Äôm so glad she did. Yuka is a great unbiased source of information that educates you on the ingredients of products and their potential impact. I‚Äôve always looked at ingredient lists, but I don‚Äôt know what every single ingredients purpose is. Yuka takes the hassle out of nutrition/skincare ingredient comprehension! I hope the app stays independent and continues to reach and educate more people!"
5,Alejandroemtz,a complete game changer when it comes to personal health. as a person who was 210 lbs one year ago to now 160 pounds. this app gives that last piece of the puzzle when it comes to health. being able to see hazardous additives along with a overall health score makes my personal fitness goals so much easier! i‚Äôll be looking like ronnie coleman thanks to Yuka!
5,Nick_waters,Just discovered this a few days ago and I love it! Super quick and easy to know if a product looks good and is worth buying! I enjoy that it‚Äôs possible to add a good that the developers had not put in themselves. Gives a sense of that there‚Äôs a community working together to help each other make better food choices. Let‚Äôs go world! Really looking forward to how this app will improve!
5,symentje606,I had a friend show me Yuka & it has been a game changer since. I in the past have gone to the store & not known exactly what to purchase‚Ä¶ now I use Yuka and I am able to find things that are actually work/are good products  If you have anxiety & feel uncomfortable asking people for help at the grocery store/ulta/sephora then this is the app for you
4,Ana Mona Lala,"Honestly this app is a still developing but the idea behind it, it‚Äôs amazing. Most bad reviews are based that some products aren‚Äôt available and u can always take picture of ingredients and they review it for u. It‚Äôs imposible for an app to know products of all ethnicity of countries. Honestly is a great app and the idea of helping you to read ingredients that u are not familiar with Is definitely a pro. Needs some adjustments but is a development app over time it would be great."
5,tchangaroo,"I love this app because it is almost like playing a mini game when I go grocery shopping, although yes you have to deal with the fact that America in particular is laden with bad-for-you products.   I became a subscriber because I want to support these developers. To make this a holy grail app for me:  1. Add carbohydrates! Even if not included in a full rating it would be really useful to have the data on-hand for my dietary journey. I would love to use this app as a way to validate keto.   2. Failing above, a picture of the nutrition facts directly would also be SO helpful.   Thank you to the small team that creates this app, my friend referred this to me because we all of tummy problems :)"
5,Dee Wible,"My reflexologist recommended this app last week. What a game changer! Who has time to look at every ingredient in every product?! No one! This has truly expedited the chore of going to the grocery store.  And ‚Äúwe‚Äù wonder why so many people are dying from cancer.  I‚Äôve told countless people of this app, and they too are most appreciative.  Thanks again for your hard work and sharing your findings."
5,LW94602,This app is amazing and it was recommended to me by my mom‚Äôs nurse. I am recommending it to everyone! It‚Äôs truly changing how we look at food and beauty products. Everything gets scanned! At first we thought it would be super depressing seeing everything we love turn out to be bad for us but instead we just feel empowered to make healthier decisions. I can‚Äôt recommend it strongly enough.
5,Juananaco,"Great app , this app really has helped me into changing what I eat and use . Here are some recommendations to make this app even better .   To have an option of animal cruelty free products it can be a separate category . And also to add a category of sunscreens alongside the day creams , shampoos , etc. probably also an option for HALAL food or kosher ? Anyway. Thank you for your work and I‚Äôll be recommending this app like crazy ."
5,s18gmong,Love this app! I‚Äôve been using it for years now and have the premium subscription. It‚Äôs really great but I wish that it would highlight more things or give you the option to turn on certain filters. Like I mostly care about additives and not if something is high in sugar or too much sodium. But it doesn‚Äôt flag high fructose corn syrup which is a huge red flag for me.
5,javucjo,"This app is great and super usefull and educational.  But I want to edit the photos and make them PNG (transparent background) and take the time to make many product‚Äôs photo perfectly accurate.  So what Im asking in short is that you add a ‚Äúselect from photo library‚Äù option when taking a photo of a product. So we can go to google, get a nice looking PNG photo. And make the product great. And its totally optional."
5,looseweight,I am so glad I came across this app. I will never buy some thing before I scan it. We don‚Äôt realize  what we are buying to apply to our face or body and also the food that we‚Äôre putting into our body until you have this app. I wish everyone could get this app and not only download the app but alsoplease donate to this app. This is a great cause for all of us.üòÄ
5,Naylah Gabriella Everett,"this app is a NEED for healthy living, and it even lets you submit ratings. the only problem I have with this app is when it doesn‚Äôt identify some products. this is the only reason i give it a 4/5. but other then that you need to download this app its truly amazing! it makes our life easier without having to take so much time researching products."
5,Folded Hands,"There aren‚Äôt enough words to fully express the convenience having Yuka‚Äôs handy food ratings with a click on your app. I‚Äôm given information in detail why the food product is excellent, good, poor to bad. Sure has made me think twice if I want to purchase an item with a poor rating. Love Yuka ‚Ä¶ as I love sharing the app‚Ä¶ makes me feel great knowing I‚Äôve picked the right choice for healthier living."
4,nukezues,"Does not show additives for current version of app for foods that do have additives. A sibling of mine has the same app but has not updated to the current version. For her, it shows additives of a dorito bag she scanned, however, for me it does not show any additives. The app does not have an option to turn on or off additives and I can not find out why it does not show the additives anywhere on the internet for this app. (Edit: this has since been corrected)"
2,SJT1084,"I just paid for the premium version of this app, and used it to search for deodorant. My current deodorant was listed as poor because it included a specific ingredient (ozokerite) so great I‚Äôll find a new one! But then when I click on a new option, it has the same ingredient listed as problematic in my original deodorant, but is considered excellent. There are duplicates everywhere with different ratings. Impossible to know what to trust unless you‚Äôre actually doing the research this app is supposed to help you avoid having to do. Super bummed. I‚Äôll stick with EWG."
5,houk2331,"I scan everything, at the store and things already around my house. It‚Äôs a great baseline to help decide and consider what I‚Äôm eating, what my kids are eating and using on their skin. Things I thought were good, I can see not only what‚Äôs in them but WHY it‚Äôs harmful. Very educational and extremely helpful when you want to be more mindful of what is going in and on your body."
5,HAHEO NATA,"Im obsessed with this app. It scans super quick, tells you the risk of each ingredient and the rating!! Ive made switches on my skincare and hair products and seen a HUGE difference. Some things look healthy and are actually awful for you. This will help! I cannot recommend this enough. You can scan pretty much any cosmetic or food product and it will give you the info you need! GET IT! GET IT! GET IT!"
5,lexi lee rae,Yuka is a fantastic app that has given me the information to make sensible and informed choices. Regarding beauty products it will list the chemical and what it is known to effect. I then can make an informed decision on if that is a chemical I want to stay away from or if I want to take a chance on it. It really helps to educate and gives us as users a chance to make the best choice for ourselves.
5,Rere900,I have been needing this app in my life! A friend of my casually suggested that I try it because she knew I was transitioning to a healthier lifestyle. So I downloaded and now I‚Äôm obsessed! In two days I have thrown out food and personal care items in my home and have made lists of substitute items to buy. This is so important for me and my family so we are not putting harmful chemicals in our body! THANK YOU!
4,Spadadada,"I‚Äôve been a big fan of Yuka ever since I downloaded it. But the one thing I am unhappy about is that they do not distinguish between good and bad sugar specifically sugar substitutes. I.e. sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, stevia and xylitol.   Overall, if these changes are added helping us identify bad substitute alternatives mentioned above I will definitely change my 4 star rating to 5 stars. I‚Äôd much rather consume natural/cane sugar than these ingredients that ruin the gut microbiome.  Note: I am a new Yuka subscription member"
5,MJ_ghum,"I LOVE this app. It gives me such peace of mind when shopping for food, household items, body care and make up! I appreciate having the option to find out more about what I‚Äôm putting in my body and my environment to try to minimize harmful chemicals as best as we can during this day and age. Please keep improving and adding products, and big thanks for the developers on this must-have app."
5,DebbieB09,I put in the sunscreen that I‚Äôve been using on my child‚Äôs skin and found out it has harsh chemicals in it. Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what harm those chemicals are to your body. Yuka tells you what effects the ingredients have on your body. The app then gives recommendations that are truly safe to use. They don‚Äôt get kick backs for doing that. Thank you for caring also about our environment!
5,Lil Al Deezy,"Listen people, download the app ‚Ä¶. it‚Äôll change the way you look at health products and snacks; etc.  They give you a grade from 0-100 on how good or bad things may be for us to eat drink or use on our skin.  Anything rated  50 and above is good to excellent. Anything under 50 is bad to poor. Thank me later or don‚Äôt thank me at all. Just please use that app. Treat yourself; don‚Äôt cheat yourself üí™üèæüíØ"
5,Marissa Harris,This app has made this big bad world seem more manageable. This app gives it to you how it is and it up to you what to do with it. I discovered most of my favorite foods weren‚Äôt necessarily the best options and Yuka provided helpful recommendations and alternatives to ease my mind. Its hard enough trying to eat healthy but Yuka helps weed out the counterfeit healthy foods. Very grateful to creators!
5,Elly Es.,"I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how grateful I am for this app. Not only that it‚Äôs educational, and free but that it is focused on the general health and well-being of individuals. Unlike pharmaceutical companies where they want you to stay sick. This app helps you become more aware of the poisons they‚Äôre putting within the products. I love this app!! Please never change, you guys are saving lives!!!"
5,JexseT,"This app is fantastic and a must have for anyone wanting to be more conscious of their health. Simply scanning products and instantly showing the positives and negatives while also offering alternatives is so useful. I use it every time i‚Äôm out shopping.  I hope that they continue to expand into more product ranges such as deodorant, etc.  Overall a 10/10 experience."
5,Zimrud,"I‚Äôm just using this app for the last two weeks, but feeling like it is feeling a need I‚Äôve had for sometime. I love scanning the barcodes and finding a better alternative. Even items like tortillas, which we eat a lot of in the southwest of the United States, dairy and their content preservatives and nutritional value. Yuka has brought this information to me ‚Äì to my fingertips!"
5,krieker,Really enjoy the app so far. I have trouble looking up all ingredients so this app is great with that and gives me the reasoning why the product is poor or bad. Definitely will be trying different products. I also have a suggestion that I think would be really helpful later on. Would love to be able to scan pet food/treats to figure out what‚Äôs good and bad for my pets.
5,tcreed1226,"I‚Äôve had a lot of apps to scan products, but normally it‚Äôll just give macros. This gives a full breakdown of ingredients for good and bad and the issues associated to each ingredient. And to top it off it works on all products not just food and drinks. And now with the feature to email the companies about the additives, it goes above and beyond. Highly recommend."
4,Sonar11,"Perfect performance, comprehensive analysis report. Everything is nice and smooth. But, I which I can add custom ingredients that I‚Äôve just found I‚Äôm allergic to. For example, I‚Äôm allergic to nickel. It would be nice to add a nickel-free diet category. Also it would be nice if I could add custom ingredients I want to avoid. For example I‚Äôm allergic to propylene glycol and ylang ylang. If I could add these to the list of dangerous for me it would help make my shopping easier.  Is it possible to implement?"
1,MrManMax,"Out of all the products I‚Äôve scanned using this app, it only worked on my cerave moisturizer. I went to scan some hummus I bought simply out of curiosity and it read it as mustard and when I tried it again it read it as creave face wash? Then, I thought I might as well just search the brand but when I went to do so, it said I had to be a member. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs cool whenever it actually works, but putting the option to just use a search bar instead behind a paywall is insane."
5,Piajmd,"I was looking for something like this for ages! I am so happy I found this app. It is easy to use, thorough in their explanations and I love that they analyze the label of something that is not in their database and then it gets added. It has been an eye opening experience. Especially trying to buy snacks for my kids. Not everything organic is good. Thank you for creating this app."
5,nlehmkuhl,"The app is great however I think it sometimes rates food as ‚Äúbad‚Äù due to not so bad things such as calorie content. Like peanut butter, it‚Äôll say it isn‚Äôt as good and have a lower rating but just because the calorie per serving is a little high, but does not mean the food itself is bad for you. I‚Äôd recommend reading everything it says about the product before deciding to buy or not."
5,Dandylyn,"Overall, I am extremely pleased with the information this application contains.  People  who are put off by past experiences of hearing ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat things like eggs for example.. then hearing OK eggs are OK to eat again .. these people might seriously consider getting over it and look at this application from the perspective of its benefits.   Thank you for doing the research on amount of hazardous chemicals that are put in food.  It‚Äôs also awesome that the application offers alternatives to the food with the hazardous chemicals that do not have such and are healthy/effective.  I‚Äôm appreciative of the fact that you rate beauty related items as well as food and that you allow foods not rated to be input into the application.  GREAT JOB!!!"
5,DAILYCoverage,I‚Äôm extremely please with this app! I am one who reads labels because I want to know what my food has in it. Sadly in the US a lot of advertising on food is false and contains harmful ingredients. this app helps detect what those harmful ingredients are.   I am obsessed with this app and I now spread the word about this to my law enforcement family. Now I have friends and coworkers scanning away and they‚Äôre please with this app.
5,Lukas.La,"I‚Äôm really enjoying this app. It‚Äôs so helpful when picking items at the store. I just worry it will get taken down, or the food companies are going to file a lawsuit when they start losing money. There should be transparency in what goes into our food, and this country needs to do a better job with that. This app is a fantastic starting place."
5,Evan Wol,"My girlfriend recently showed me this app I usually am pretty good with my health and eat well, but some of the foods and snacks I get that are advertised as healthy snacks or low in fat or in sugar have so many additives! I now scan almost everything I buy and this app really will help if you are trying to eat better and stay away from harmful chemicals and ingredients that companies slip into products!"
5,0763elf,Sometimes it recommends non comparable food items as replacements but so far it‚Äôs helping me redesign my grocery list for non toxic food and skin care products ! I‚Äôm really surprised about some of the brands that are safer than others or what I have bought in the past and how it compares safety Wise to similar products. The non biased brand opinion makes a difference. Thanks YUKA ! My friends are liking it too.
5,Winslowdown,What else can I say about this app except it offers you all the information these companies don‚Äôt want you to know foods that I used to eat I don‚Äôt even touch anymore because of what they do to your body. I just want to say thank you to the creators of the app and I look forward to see how far it comes in the future!
4,emperorfeelsgrim,"I heard about this app through TikTok, and I instantly downloaded it! It has helped realize how important my body is, and further my self-care! Only issue I have with the app is I can‚Äôt put what products I already have into the overview charts. Because you have to scan the barcode, when you don‚Äôt have, you would have to go in store and scan it. Other than that, love the app!! Hope to keeping using it for years to come!!"
5,Leslie Burnett,My son heard me checking food in the pantry and came to see what I was doing. I scanned his chili and asked if he wanted that or wanted to find a new brand.  It‚Äôs great for them to be able to make that choice. It‚Äôs also great to have an app say it‚Äôs not good instead of a mom that doesn‚Äôt know anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôm thankful my daughter recommended this to me. I‚Äôm recommending it to others ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Poloug,"5 stars because they make a big difference in our lives.  Before we buy, we can the products & if it‚Äôs approved by Yuka, we get it. I believe if everyone uses it they‚Äôll know what it means to obtain a healthy choice. I recommend Yuka to my friends & relatives who are curious about it. Thank you Julia, one of the owners who came from France.  Hope to meet you or your staff to thank you.  Good luck!!! Pacifico & May"
5,Santino2026,This app is easily the best when it comes to the user interface and the content provided. This app has made me a mindful person when it comes to shopping at my local market. I would recommend supporting them by subscribing to their monthly supporters payment as this program will help many make better decisions.
4,4k2d,"This app is very helpful when it comes to knowing what I should or shouldn't use, but once in a while, I feel like the rating of a product that I know is a good product is not correct when it says it‚Äôs poor. It comes down to the ingredients in the product and the affect that they can have on someone, but still, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt seem like a good product is getting the correct rating."
5,sid woodhouse,"Their emails are personal and their app is amazing. This app isn‚Äôt trying to scam you or capitalise on your personal data. It has helped me a lot when I‚Äôm at the store and I‚Äôm trying to pick the healthiest option. You just scan the barcode of the item and it will tell you what ingredients are unhealthy and to what scale to which they are. Truly the coolest app, best way to start off 2023 !!"
5,Marvin Chris,"You guys are amazing! Just a big thank you for putting your own personal time for making such an important app that actually gives accurate nutritional value to food products that people think are ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, even though most of them are not harmful, its a huge help for people starting their journey to a healthy diet and more!"
5,Polydactyl lova,"Lots of food labels are misleading, making consumers believe they are eating something healthy‚Ä¶..well this APP opens many peoples eyes as to just what companies actually put in their products. This APP leaves no one wondering. It breaks down everything listed so that you, the consumer, has a clearer understanding of EXACTLY what your ingesting. Its the new FDA! Use it, tell all your friends, lets start getting healthy!  Thank you YUKA"
5,MHDfloridabuilt23,"I have used the app for all things food and cosmetics and it‚Äôs phenomenal! It sources from qualified institutions from the EU, USA, and additional studies. It lists all sorts of details of every product on the market. The features are useful and easy to use. You have all the data to make great health decisions as a consumer. The aesthetics are A+ and sleek. The price to be a member is affordable and a no brainer.   Keep up the great work YUKA!üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ"
5,Massinissa01,"The app is perfect, it helped me a lot. But I wish I could just type the ingredients of a product and just get a quick rating. Especially if you try to scan the barcode but you get a message ‚Äúunknown barcode‚Äù perhaps it‚Äôs because the product is home made. Overall the app is perfect"
5,Sperry84093,I love Yuka. But for those of us on low Sodium didn‚Äôt the search is not helpful. Can you add search by nutritional fact. Then anyone could search by Sodium or sugary or whatever at sort by amount. Currently I have to open all of the search results which isn‚Äôt really searching. It‚Äôs like cray man browsing. Make us all happy. Add search by nutritional fact üòÄ
5,Reviewer47253,I‚Äôve recommended this app to so many friends and family. I use it every time I shop and it‚Äôs allowed me to be more informed and conscious about the products/brands I buy and support. The best way to force companies to stop putting harmful additives in food and cosmetics and start making healthier alternatives is by NOT BUYING it. Truly grateful for the creators of this app and their mission.
5,Onedayvinefamous,"I love this app! So much! It‚Äôs made shopping so much easier, especially cosmetics. The only thing it is missing for me is to deduct points for food coloring. There have been multiple times I‚Äôve bought something with an excellent score then saw that it had food coloring when I got home. I‚Äôd love to see that update. Also, deductions for vegetable oils would be great too!"
5,anjenieagle,"Literally the best app ever I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs free! It doesn‚Äôt only give you a rating of the product out of 100 but it‚Äôs gives you why it‚Äôs bad and the healthy amount of chemicals you should have in your products as well, also it gives you paragraph of reasons why a certain chemical is bad! Download this if you are on a journey to being healthier inside and out!!!!!üíóüíóüíó"
5,Blurredmachine,"This app is amazing that whenever I go shopping, I just take this app scanner always in front of me and then when I look at a product and I feel craving about having it I just scan it and see all the carcinogenic items that it has added. Makes me so easy to not buy all that crappy food and maintain a very good healthy diet."
5,Melahnee,"I recommend this app to everyone , it lets you know specifically how bad a product can be as well as how good and safe a product can be . If a product is bad it gives you suggestions and alternatives to better and cleaner products. Your body is your home so it is important to pay attention to the products you‚Äôre using and consuming."
5,Curlyhairlady,"This app has changed my life. My eyes have been opened to the truth of how much chemicals ruled my life. From shampoos to lotion, perfume, makeup and hair products that I had were ALL TOXIC. Since I got the all I‚Äôve thrown everything out and started fresh. I feel more energized and ‚Äúclear minded‚Äù, I‚Äôm super conscious of what I put into my body. Can‚Äôt look back. 10/10 how easy it is to use as well."
1,Blackangel13,"First harvesting your information by requiring an email address in order to access means they are just selling your info on what products you are scanning and selling that to advertisers.   Second, none of this is based on nutrition or science. It says 130mg of sodium per serving is bad. Clams by themselves have 1021 mg per serving, and also has 21 g of lean protein 21% DV or Vitamin C, 13% iron, 6% calcium, 11% potassium(something you should focus on more than sodium intake) and 23% phosphorous. It has 1,401% your DV of b12! But it says bad because high sodium. That‚Äôs dangerous and predatory behavior. This app needs to be reported and fined for posing as doctors giving medical advice."
2,glitchykitten,"It‚Äôs a fine app, but if you want to use it to determine the safety of something, you can‚Äôt go by the health score. It takes into account many dieting factors like sugar and calories, which I would assume most people would already be aware of. I‚Äôve had foods with no dangerous additives labeled as ‚Äúbad‚Äù and given very low health scores, simply because they had ‚Äútoo many calories‚Äù for the generic person they thought might be eating them. Makes the app more difficult to use than it should be, but the concept is there."
5,chrissy 20205,"I can‚Äôt put my phone down.  I got the app and started scanning everything in my  cupboards! My gosh! It was so eye-opening, all this time we thought we were making great choices in our grocery shopping.  I‚Äôve discovered that these huge companies are killing us with all the additives, phosphates, and food coloring!  Love this app and recommend it to everyone that buys groceries üòÄüëçüèª"
5,Quiks1lver,"This app has helped me so much with my food purchases! It‚Äôs very easy to use and extremely informative. Even my kids have such a fun time scanning items (mostly snacks) and they don‚Äôt want to buy anything now if it shows orange or red (bad scan); it‚Äôs like a game kind of for them, which is perfect. They only want the green (good) scanned snacks! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks for the app! We are really enjoying it!"
5,WB_51,Making health choices on the fly is often difficult and time consuming with little frame of reference available or constantly researching while you‚Äôre navigating the aisles of a food store. This app provides ‚Äúquick‚Äù reference from poor to excellent to help make  informed choices when time is a factor!! Great go to tool!
5,pizzaquick,"I have been using this app for about a week ago. I was introduced by a coworker.  I almost never pay for the premium version, but this one is worth it!! I have been scanning all over my kitchen and bathroom. I am amazed by the things I thought were healthy, that are not. I am lactose intolerant, and i can set to detect lactose. You can also set for gluten. I highly recommend this app!"
5,Lola lola,"I adore this app! If knowledge is power then this app is the Rosetta Stone for food & beauty products. I'm learning so much about all the products I've been using for years. I instantly shared it with family & friend. (Hey developers, after the first Share, there should always be an easy way to share this App inside the app itself. Everyone should know about Yuka!)."
3,joswii,"I like this app for beauty products and such, but I don‚Äôt like it as much for food. I do like that it shows all the ingredients for everything, and what‚Äôs bad and good and for what reasons. However I have noticed on a lot of the food items? It will mark it down for having too many calories, even if it is a natural healthy product. There are many foods that are very good for you, but are high in calories, but this will mark the item down. Life isn‚Äôt all about counting calories."
1,8 bit snow,"You have to create a login.  You can't try out the app first.  Automatic 1 star.  Then once you do make a login, it makes you scan something.  Ok, that's a great option, but no search?  I love the idea of this app.  I get it is meant for use on the go with scanning being a primary use case.  However, I don't want to go dig out something to scan at the moment.  That's friction and an off putting user experience.  I saw mention of the app and decided to check it out, but this terrible first impression has turned off a potential user.  Deleted."
5,Srpinni,I recommend this app to everyone I know. I never knew just how chemical laden my cosmetics were. I was shocked. Needless to say I have definitely changed the brands that I use on my face these days. It is well worth the yearly subscription fee to have the search function at your fingertips!!!  Used it one day at a big box store scanning deodorants. Another eye opener!!!  Keep up the good work!!
5,JossBossRoss,I love the transparency of the information from this app. So many of the products I was using had so many harmful chemicals. I use it for my groceries and skincare products. I have peace of mind every time I use or eat something I have purchased because it was scanned through this app. Thank you to the people who made this a thing!
1,FormerYukaFan,"This used to be my go-to app when shopping, but I‚Äôm beginning to wonder (especially after reading the recent comments) that your app has become compromised? Many have been victims to cyberattacks lately, myself included, and I recently bought a new iPhone and created a new Apple ID account, but haven‚Äôt been able to create a new account after downloading your app because your error message claims my new email address is invalid. I tried my former email address and I still get the same message. Your app‚Äôs become unusable."
1,gayreich‚Ñ¢,"This app is pretty good when the info on the products are scanning is actually correct but half the time I‚Äôm scanning stuff and then I‚Äôm looking into the additives or the ingredients list and half the things are either misspelled or completely incorrect so how are you giving a score effectively on a product when the ingredients listed that you‚Äôre pulling the information from is incorrect it just makes no sense they should have a more diligent process as far as vetting the ingredients are actually correct! Like we‚Äôre in 2024, shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult."
5,Nolivalentine,I love the Yuka app!   I use the app while I‚Äôm shopping and when I scan my products and if doesn‚Äôt pass the Yuka test it does not go in my shopping cart.  I love this app  because I love to live a healthy clean life as much as possible and  I love it so much that I upgraded to premium for $13 a year you are helping the team employed so they can continue to evaluate and research products.
5,dnfnjjdnnfnf,"I‚Äôve been using this app for only 5 days and it is already proving so useful! It allows me to find the nutritional info of pretty much any product! And if it isn‚Äôt on there, you can add it to the crowdsourced database. It‚Äôs so cool and fascinating. Also, the app assigns a so-called ‚Äúscore‚Äù to each product that rates how healthy it is. It makes the work to find healthy foods so simple. üëç"
5,Dana4Well Being,Making a commitment to eating healthier and using healthier products is not easy. But the Yuka app makes living healthy so much easier. The app can tell you exactly what is in your products. It gives you in depth resources if you want to learn more. And it provides recommendations for the healthiest choices. I hope more people use Yuka so they can keep providing this valuable service!
5,Southern cowgirl,Yuka has saved me so much time by not having to research every item online myself. The helpful information is so eye opening! So many products we as consumers ‚Äúthink‚Äù and are misled to believe are good for us and safe for us to use and consume in actuality are NOT!! Some infact contain many hazards to our health! Thank you Yuka!!! I am a member from now on! Get the premium use of Yuka! Well worth it!!! üòä
5,Maxxparker,I‚Äôm a full believer when it comes to our food is poisoning us. I watch what I eat all the time for me and my family because I know the benefits of eating healthy. This app makes it so much easier it shows everything you need to know from sugar to preserves. And you don‚Äôt have to pay like most apps. They care about health not money. It‚Äôs got my vote.
5,cocoa sweets,I don‚Äôt leave reviews often on apps but I‚Äôve been telling everyone and anyone on social media and in person about this app. I do not shop without it!!  I love how informative and detailed it is. This helped me identify food and products that are not safe which has helped me shop for me and my 4 year old son. I could go on and on about how good this app is.
5,notp1nk,"I love this app but my account got locked cause my friends added my school computer as a skincare product to the data base and I got my account permanently locked for a stupid mistake I want my account back I don‚Äôt know what to do right now, I keep deleting it and redownloading but it still has my data I just want my account back"
5,princessmoee11,I love this app very much! It makes finding healthier products MUCH easier :)  I think something that could help would be the ability to upload photos of a barcode rather than a strictly the scanner. Like take a screenshot of what you‚Äôre thinking to get so that way I don‚Äôt physically have to be at the store to find the stuff then buy. If that makes sense XD
4,Apprater404,"I‚Äôd love for the scan to include crucial information on how processed the food is, as high processed foods aren‚Äôt necessarily taken into consideration here. I‚Äôd also like to see some data on micro plastic measurements.   Im she‚Äôs this is extremely difficult to implement and might require a lot, but it is the 2 core components to being a fully aware consumer that aren‚Äôt present. Even basic information on these 2 areas is helpful."
5,marcco68,So there we were in the break room at work scanning each other‚Äôs food. It was fun but I also learned a lot about some of foods that I thought were healthy. But most important for me is the suggestions. I used the app in the grocery store and was able to level up choices for the things I already buy and eat.
5,david032511,There were a lot of products that I‚Äôve found out that is very harmful to your health and well-being and this app helps me find those products and determine which products are good for me. This app is amazing and the developers should be proud that they are actively changing lives with this app and possibly saving some as well.
5,an0NYmOuSSsssllyyy,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever written a review for anything ever..Until now because I am obsessed with this app so many benefits for you/ur health/ ur kids health etc!!I love how it even gives you suggestions if it‚Äôs not good for you. Here in America there are so many things we don‚Äôt know what that in food and cosmetics so it‚Äôs amazing and whoever made this app thank you .. thank you so much you rock!!!
5,adhhvcftubvxdrtjnnnnnnjgfc,I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH!!! I use this app all the time! It‚Äôs so fun to scan everything in my fridge and figure out what to stop buying and what to buy instead!! I have one suggestion please please please add a feature where you can see where to find some of the healthier suggestions!!! I know I could just search on google. But having it on the app would be so so convenient! Love you Yuka so much ‚ô•Ô∏è
5,lexiguess,"I love this app so much, I don‚Äôt even pay for the premium and it‚Äôs a wonderful app. I don‚Äôt go to the grocery store without scanning every self care product I think about buying. This app has changed my skin routine my hair routine and more to come. I recommend this app to everyone I know and if your reading this I recommend this app to you as well."
5,Bombshellz,"I review products and I am a beauty expert on Beautytap under Seekingsusan and this app really helps me with my journey on eating healthy food and using non toxic products . I really find joy in going into grocery stores and start scanning products it almost causes a crowd when u go in a grocery store and people see you . It‚Äôs fun , educational and great for your health . I love this app and I highly recommend it !"
5,EdgarG24,"I‚Äôm not one to leave reviews, but I had to for this app. I‚Äôve been on a fitness journey and Yuka has made my life a lot easier in terms of finding the right kind of nutrition. Items I used to think were healthy were actually full of harmful additives. Not only did they find what was risky, but they recommend healthier alternatives. I absolutely love this app. Highly recommend."
4,xl fable,"After I started using this app I‚Äôve noticed a difference in my health, my digestive system has been functioning a little bit better now that I get to keep track of ingredients that are in my food. I just wish the app was able to also rate supplement, vitamins , etc ‚Ä¶ this app is wonderful but that one thing , I hope to see that one day so for  I‚Äôll continue to use this wonderful app ‚ú®üò≠"
5,Fnpolsh1973,We as a family have been learning a lot about what ingredients and chemicals are being put in our food and cosmetics. This app has been such a great resource and learning experience. We are slowly making changes as a family swapping out chemical ridden products for more TRUE clean foods and products.  Thank you so much Yuka team!!
1,Chrisdmarquez,"For those who are trying to find an app that helps determine if the product is good enough to purchase, I recommend using a different one. I noticed some of the products I was using were given an average rating but the recommendations that it would give me were absurd. It recommended me to use clean and clear products when in fact their products have gone through multiple lawsuits in the past due to cancerous ingredients they put in their products. Any product that has the additive yellow included in their ingredient is a NO! Be safe and try better next time Yuka."
5,Dog_mom_of_two,"This app has helped us really understand what eating clean means!! We went through every item in our pantry, freezer, and fridge! Along with all the products in our bathroom. I highly recommend using this app when grocery shopping too! I do wish you could use this app for pet food/treats as well!! I hope they come up with a ‚Äúpet mode‚Äù in the near future!"
5,EE2140,"This app has had a huge impact on my family‚Äôs food choices. The best part of the app is that it is SO easy to use and has literally every product I have ever scanned. I love the rating system, details about harmful additives, including the research and specifics. I love that cosmetics are included too. I hope that cleaning agents might be added at some point in the future."
5,relamdestroyer,This app is very easy to use and the process of adding new items is very quick and requires almost no typing other than the name of the product. The rating can seem a little harsh if you are good at regulating your intake but never fails to point out the harmful additives that are in food or personal care products.
5,MiaFl024,"Wow I‚Äôm glad I found this app and am now aware that a lot of products need to go to the trash. Especially shocking, my Neutrogena sunscreen I‚Äôve been using for years on a daily basis contains very harmful ingredients. I was under the impression that‚Äôs a brand you can trust but apparently not. Glad I now know. Thanks for making this useful app free!"
5,Luna__bella,"This app, I use EVERYWHERE !! I recommend to EVERYONE !!! This has helped turn my house into a more eco, healthier home. It has made me find better items that have actually improved my overall mood/health !! I cannot get enough of this app.   I love the fact that I can update items and help make things over all easier and better for other users !"
5,jesicaaaaaaaasaaaaaaa,This app allows you to accurately see you each ingredient that a product contains. It also provides the sources listed for its ratings. This Apple loves you to do your own research to find out. If this is something you want to do or a product you want to use. rarely has an app. Have this much impact on my life. Amazing amazing amazing 10 stars.
2,m3talc0re,"This app is great for making you more aware of some of the ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù harmful ingredients in products, but their recommendations are just as bad and they‚Äôll rate them good. Changing the portion size can change the results between two products. It just told me a bread with 4g of sugar per slice is better than a Keto bread I scanned. It will also tell you Arizona fruit punch is better than the tea because the serving size in the punch is like 8oz and less sugar vs the 12 or 16oz of the tea with more sugar. But ounce for ounce, the fruit punch has way more sugar."
5,kantonschnell,I am a physician that helps people become healthier and live longer. I recommend this app daily so my clients can easily see where additives hide and healthy nutrients flourish. I had one client that lost 11 pounds in one month just by sticking to the foods in the good and green colors of the app recommendations. Thank you for such a great app! You‚Äôre making the world a healthier place!
5,User female,This app is going to replace Fooducate for me! I love that the recommended alternatives are all decent instead of the former app where it shows you C‚Äôs and D‚Äôs. I love the way the information is displayed where I‚Äôm interested in seeing if a product has negative additives etc. The scan history and recommended tab are fantastic too! I‚Äôm looking forward to the annual pricing to support a great product.
5,Russell77x7,We absolutely love this app! It is sooo informative and it‚Äôs been awesome being able to share this information and app with loved ones! It‚Äôs made things sooo much easier instead of having to work so hard to dig for info on products it‚Äôs right there at your fingertips! Makes decision making so much easier!! ‚ù§Ô∏è you guys for creating this life changing app!
5,sarden23,I love this App. I use it every day! Companies are no longer transparent and anyone can claim health now days. I love being able to make educated decisions about what I put on and in my body :) sometimes I still eat or use the things that aren‚Äôt the best but this is making it possible to transition to much better and be involved in my own health choices
5,Hayden7531135786532,"I have different type‚Äôs of hair in some parts, and most of the shampoo and conditioner I use make my hair really dry or hard, I had saw this app on tiktok and decided to download it cause I needed the right type of shampoo and conditioner, I went to Walmart and found a bunch that are great for my hair, this app also does food too, it‚Äôs an amazing app and I think everyone should have this!"
5,Sparky11309,"This app is truly amazing I can‚Äôt believe anyone could give it a one star.  When you break it down this app can be used to help you become healthier and see what‚Äôs going into you‚Äôre body.  I was diagnosed with brain tumors, and my wife found this app shortly after. I have noticed a huge change in both of our health while using the app and cutting out all the toxins in this app  I literally recommend this app to everyone I can people at the grocery store, friends family anyone that is interested and not lol.  I‚Äôm not a total health nut but just being able to see the chemical breakdown and what they cause is amazing.  I can‚Äôt believe the app is free!"
1,"Read a book, not 'the book'","This app just tells you what the product‚Äôs packaging tells you‚Ä¶but most products are still not even in the system yet, so it asks the users to upload product information. 0 stars. This is way more steps than just reading the nutrition/ingredients label on the back of the product you have in your hand. It just seems so silly.  Why take a picture, upload it, type in all of the product‚Äôs packaging information in ‚Ä¶so it could tell you what you would already know by reading the label you just typed in. Genius!"
5,monolith number1,Want to start with saying thank you for developing this app. My wife and I are working on getting as healthy as possible by removing GMO's and other chemicals from our diet. The app works easily and does a great job. And as it couldn't get any better I became a premium member and discovered so much more. Thanks again and know I have turned my friends and family on to your app.
5,Diesel_Boss,"This app is literally a life saver. It will open up your eyes on the food industry and how the FDA fails its job to protect us against money hungry food companies. Go ahead and download this free app and start scanning your food right away. You will be unpleasantly surprised to see so many hazardous additives in your food. Be careful, shop smarter, always scan your food, cosmetics, lotions with Yuka."
5,Alafalanazon,I‚Äôve gotten so many people to download this app I should be payed a commission. I thought I knew a thing or two about clean eating / product use‚Ä¶until I got this app. I scan everything. I‚Äôd scan toilet paper if It had the option. I‚Äôve learned more about food processing through this app than with my degree in food systems. Thank you.
5,Paperjamila,"This app is one of those apps where you wish you could send more money, or you wish you HAD  to pay for it  So useful and quick, plus sometimes articles and sources are linked to verify claims of an additive being limited or high risk. AND other recommendations !? Seriously a life saver to have both of those as features  Love this app"
5,xo638,"I thought I was a smart and healthy shopper but Yuka has been a real eye opener. You‚Äôd be surprised by the number of products you thought were healthy - but aren‚Äôt, and ones you avoided that turn out to be good. I use it all the time now and it has saved me money (especially on cosmetics) and given me healthy food choices.  You really should get this app!!! It‚Äôs wonderful!"
5,misstyra03,"This app is phenomenal! The fact that it‚Äôs free is crazy, I use it almost everyday. If you can, please contribute to keep this app running free! I love that they give recommendations for healthier options at the bottom once you scan an item. Im also surprised they have SO many items in their system. Thank you guys so much, you‚Äôve changed the game."
5,Strawberryllh,"Absolutely love this app for food and cosmetic products, have tried a few others and Yuka‚Äôs user experience and product information is 10x better.   Biggest downside is no cleaning products or supplement information. I would pay twice as much for the premium membership if this was included!!!"
5,Kina.112555555,I LOVE this app! It‚Äôs helped me so much in choosing products that are right for my daughter and I. It also informs you of why each toxin is bad for you and gives you recommendations for similar products that are of course better for you! This is a necessity app for me now and has been for quite some time now! Thank you for creating this!!
5,Jahquari007,Are usually don‚Äôt write reviews but this one I couldn‚Äôt skip. I‚Äôve had this app for only four hours and I went to the grocery store and I can‚Äôt believe how helpful this app is. I love everything about it. It gives details on everything and lets you know that there are better choices. All I can say is thank you very much.
5,KWSPgH,I have scanned many things including a Sams Club Members Mark product and the results were given. There has been only one occasion where a product was not rated and in their system but I already knew I should be eating it anyway!! Please Yuka keep up the good work! And thank you for allowing easy access to nutritional information!
5,shortcake91,"I finally have an app that helps me really know what is in my food! Being able to read about the additives in food I‚Äôm buying is what I‚Äôve been looking for, because not buying something for not understanding the ingredients list wasn‚Äôt good enough. Thank you for making this app and I‚Äôm so glad to say that I use it almost daily."
5,ShaneyDane1111236787,"This app is amazing! It has already helped me make better, healthier decisions for my family and me. It is so easy to just scan and see the rating and explanation. It is so user-friendly and thoroughly explains everything. It even gives better alternatives. I really can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app. I am so grateful for it."
5,holldorff,Very valuable information about what your putting on/inside your body! I feel like I have a lot more control because it‚Äôs so easy to figure out if what you have is bad for you. Just scan or search it‚Äôs there and has detailed information about each ingredient good or bad. So much more peace of mind!! Thank you Yuka!!!!
3,mew me,"Okay I keep accidentally deleting my reviews so I‚Äôm gonna keep this one short. Most of the time, it‚Äôs accurate. But it‚Äôs inaccurate way more often than it should be. For example, when I scanned my hair conditioner it reccomended body lotion. Also when I scanned my salted peanuts (the only ingredients were salt and peanuts) it said it was poor. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense and I think the product needs a lot of work‚Ä¶ but it was kind of fun scanning stuff around my house for no reason lol."
5,dancegina7,"I really appreciate YUKA app as it helps me make informed decisions that I've been reading and discovering for over 20 years. I love to read labels and ensure I'm eating the right food for my health. While food is essential for survival, it's equally important to keep chemicals out of our food and be mindful of what our bodies intake daily. This is crucial for our vital health. I highly recommend this app!"
5,korkegi,I find this app very helpful . It‚Äôs helping me to get healthier products and gives me recommendations on good products to get . It‚Äôs very easy to use . I highly recommended it .  I am a teacher of young children and I‚Äôm shock to see the unhealthy snacks and lunches parents pack in their lunch  boxes . Parents need to use this appearance choosing their children food.
5,üñ§üíúüñ§üôåüèæüíú,"I love the fact you can save the good food to history, I pay more attention to additives. Hopefully, it will not charge us in the future. Once you learn the products you will be on the road to healthy eating.  I would like for all products to be rated, if its not rated I do not buy.  Please try to expand and rate more products as far as food."
5,Listolicious,For starters this is the only food scanner app that lets you do unlimited scans for free without subscription. This app has helped so much with changing my diet and becoming healthier. This is a must have that everyone should have on their phone and to use every time they shop so they don‚Äôt end up with some crazy cancer and die a horrible death
5,plated app,Thank you for this App that helps keep me and my family healthy!! So needed for busy mom‚Äôs who want to know what is healthy and what is not as fast as possible while shopping with children! Every parent needs this! So easy to educate myself now on all the chemicals put into food. And wonderful there are healthy recommendations to replace items! Thank youüôèüèª
5,Leakfreak,I got to know about the app through one of my friends. Ever since I started using Yuka it literally changed my perspective about everything I see while grocery shopping. The most important aspect is the fact that it has alternative suggestions for bad/poor rated products which I found to be very useful.
5,EmmV01,So I found this app from tic tok literally last night and let me tell you i have been scanning all the items in my house. Not only does it tell you the rating of health on the item but it gives you recommendations for better use as well. Never found a better app without ads and it‚Äôs legit. Definitely download this app you guys will be thankful:)
5,thechihuahuaisin,"My mom and I love it, we have gotten rid of so much and have even replaced things with better alternatives that have made a huge difference to our skin! Thank you Yuka for helping, I am absolutely so grateful for your app! I think that it‚Äôs very helpful, especially now we hate 5+ kids wanting skin care, and parents not knowing what‚Äôs good and bad for the skin based on packaging!"
4,Mscarolinebster,"The idea for the app is wonderful, however the execution is so-so. The app requires that it‚Äôs user upload the product ingredients and doesn‚Äôt verify its accuracy. Therefore some products may not have all ingredients added, which can‚Äôt give you the full scope on how safe the product is or isn‚Äôt.  Also, when reviewing the same products on competitors sites like EWG, they are not on the same page. It makes me wonder if the app‚Äôs information is trustworthy."
5,iamninjareviwer,"Great quick way to find a better alternative when shopping. Further research is needed and you still need to figure out what‚Äôs best for you, but this is a fantastic start in building a strong diet. I would love to see more ways to support the app and spread the word and create a community. Maybe cool merch please designed by artists that share health values?"
5,Fashionista524,As a person that always reads the label of everything I buy and constantly having to google the side effects of foreign ingredients this amazing app does all the work for me thus making my shopping experience pleasurable and not frustrating and anxiety ridden.  I‚Äôm obsessed with this app and highly recommend especially for those that are health conscious.
3,SarotoninLe,"The details of what you look for in this app is minimal. There is no listed pricing for products you scan. If even for better, pricing for each serving product. To balance worth and quality is more helpful than the given information. This is a good app. Some information needs to be updated as well, some products that are part of being a cosmetic or food are not listed to have data.   I‚Äôm a self-proclaimed critic. üë∂üëç"
2,Liqcvby469,After using this app it does not no how to rate spray oils and a hot sauce Cholula saying bad with a sodium of 110  0 carbs  but list a known bad pace picante sauce as good which has more than double the sodium and known bad ingredients and many others containing real sugar and higher carb‚Äôs starting using higher rated apps the best so far is Bobby‚Äôs app will show bad ingredients information and list the best products with clean and organic ingredients salt is needed in humans and is easy to find good information on how much is acceptable for 1 recommended serving pure cane sugars are bad along with preservatives
5,Amberevelynn,"I am so impressed with this app. I believe this will help people take charge of their own health by spreading knowledge about the harmful ingredients the FDA allows in our beauty products and food. By scoring and explaining the harsh ingredients, it helps me make a conscious choice to choose better, lesser known brands that actually put quality ingredients in their products."
5,Raestarr2400,I had no idea an app like this existed. I came across it by accident. I am always looking for nutritional info on products I buy but it is very time consuming on the internet. I am so stoked about this app and have already set aside foods I‚Äôm throwing away. Making healthy replacements available you can go buy for those products is a Godsend. Thank you!
5,doctor danner,"The one thing I ask of you‚Ä¶Please stay objective!!! Please let us know that you will NOT be bought out by people who, to different degrees, do not care about the truth. Thankyou so much for your support of the best for the world! We love you and what you have created and your service to all of us. Putting choice, through awareness, back into our own hands."
3,TheodoraDimitra,"When I scanned an item that is poor, I chose to try their recommendations on the bottom which have great scores. Then I scan the recommendations and they end up also having poor scores. This has happened multiple times and therefore I feel like I can no longer trust Yuka. So sad because I was happy to have an app that can help me stay away from bad chemicals."
5,GratefulLife,This app has helped me to determine the food I need to keep or eliminate from my diet. I was really gratified to know that many of the foods I eat were in the Good or Excellent. I use when I am shopping and it has also helped to select healthy alternatives. I especially enjoy finding out about the unhealthy additives. So glad this app is available.
5,Jmrjudee,Find out what is really in the products you eat. I was shocked by what was in many of the so called healthy foods I was eating. The best part of Yuka is the alternative healthier products that are recommended. Love this app! And their customer support is five-star also. I found an item that was not correct in the ingredients listed and they corrected it immediately.
5,Sambocephus,If you want to understand ingredients and REALLY learn what‚Äôs in your food then this is the app for you!! We have turned it into a family affair and my kids have now taken control of their health as well we now know what most ingredients really are and I love that the app allows you to filter your dietary guidelines!! Hands down the best app you didn‚Äôt know you neededü•∞
4,gmoney american,"I have been using this app for years now to help me find healthier alternatives to everyday items and it‚Äôs been super helpful for someone like me who‚Äôs really trying to be health conscious. The only thing I‚Äôve become more conscious about in the last year is Cedar Hills, and one thing that you could does not highlight as bad is seed oils such as sunflower, soybean, canola oil, etc. if they add that this app will be 5 stars."
5,Shart face 1018963,"I never write reviews but I felt compelled to because of how great this app is. Yuka is absolutely amazing. If you‚Äôre someone who is trying to be health conscious it is an absolute must. Thank you Benoit, Julie, and Fran√ßois for creating something that legitimately saves lives by educating people about harmful ingredients and chemicals in their food/beauty products. For the sake of everyone please never sell out!"
2,BettyElizabethHill,"I am currently doing a unit on health in my gym class and my teacher told us about this app. I decided to download it and at first it was giving good feedback and seemed very essential. However, when I opened the app today it told me to sign in with my email. However, I didn‚Äôt even register with my email, so I had to change‚Ä¶ My ‚Äúpassword‚Äù‚Ä¶ which I didn‚Äôt even use ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And then when I started scanning again it just would not work for some reason. I have a video that I can send to someone‚Äôs email."
5,JennGreen739,This app is amazing I found it shocking to see what items in my household are actually bad for me. I love this Ann‚Äôs will be making improvements in my house thanks to this. I would love to see this app expand to other things I think finding out what laundry it wants are good for you to use. But for now i will definitely be using it to frighten out cosmetics and food iteams!!
5,breezycreek,"My nephew showed me this app.  I have always made my food from scratch but this is a game changer.  Every parent in America needs to re-evaluate how they feed themselves AND their children.    This app even gives definitions of the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù amounts of hazardous ingredients they allow in food but if you click further it tells you what they cause.   If you eat a small amount of a specific hazardous ingredient in one food, chances are it‚Äôs in another or even many foods you eat. So it‚Äôs compounding.   I say all of AMERICA needs this app.  I did pay the yearly fee for additional foods on the list because I loved it so much.  And it wasn‚Äôt much at all.   Love this app"
5,thdavis2011,I am always checking and verifying and double checking and triple checking what products I put on my body or what items I put in my body so I wanted to make sure and this app is able to do a wonderful job making my life easier and less stress overall. I hope this helps anybody else.
5,GodismyProvider206,I love the fact that when I go grocery shopping I can scan all my food and it tells me if it‚Äôs healthy or not. I don‚Äôt mind staying in the grocery store for hours now. I look forward to scanning all my food items now. I will be sharing this app with family and friends. Thanks again Yuka!!!
5,Stormebo,"Just completed the survey and had to let you guys know, The impact you have sparked in my life has had so many significant positive benefits I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough for creating an app like this!  Some of the biggest changes has been my relationship to sodas and anything with food coloring, I won‚Äôt touch it at all now because of the impact cutting those things out has had. I feel like my brain fog has completely lifted, I have a more positive outlook on life and my ability to learn, process and recall information has significantly improved and I never thought that would happen, especially as I reach my 30s!   Thank you for your creation!  üíö"
5,RikaandWalter,"I shared this app with my entire family. We have always been aware and rather intentional when it came to skincare and cosmetics, but this app made us aware that not everything on the Whole Foods isles were good! Products marketed as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù were loaded with carcinogens. Nonetheless get the app it will help you and your family be happy and healthier. Scary to check your makeup lol!"
2,BigAzWalrus,"After reading into some of the products with poor ratings, and the list of alternatives, compared with facts about products online. I found every product not found in a whole foods store is moderate to poor. Overpriced scam health foods are the only way, with a few exceptions. Of course eating too much of one thing isn‚Äôt good as well. Before you clear out your pantry with this app, do some digging because most of the products you are consuming are good if you are health conscious about what you are eating."
5,cj romeyn,I just downloaded this App and in just using it for one day I have to say I LOVE  it. I am very much into it health and love the fact that I can check my beauty products plus my food the next time I go to the grocery store I will make sure to check it out using Yuca app.   I‚Äôm recommending this to every who is into eating a healthy diet. Thank you so much developing this app. üëçüòäüëè
5,JanzerMG,"This app is absolutely wonderful! If the product is not out there, it allows you to add it. If it‚Äôs not rated, it will let you know. It‚Äôs provided me every single time with any additives or preservatives so I can know if it‚Äôs safe for me to eat or not, I have recommended this application to 10 to 12 people already and they are already using it on a regular basis!!"
4,DomTheeCreator,It really is a great app & I am so happy that they came up with this. Thank you guys. My only request would be that maybe give some information on all of the good ingredients along with the hazards of the bad ingredients. I‚Äôd like to know why this is good ingredient for me vs only knowing why an ingredient bad for me. And also maybe what‚Äôs good for someone else it may not particularly be the best for me and my agenda. If that makes sense.¬ø
1,Courtttaaney,this app tells you what products contain. what it doesn‚Äôt do is explain how much of these ingredients they actually have. a lot of the skin care products that you look up have ‚Äúpoor‚Äù ratings because of some of these ingredients. i work in the skin care industry and i know for a FACT that these are specially formulated so that these ‚Äúbad‚Äù ingredients aren‚Äôt harmful to your health or your skin. they just pick out the ingredients that are labeled as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and freak you out. this is a TERRIBLE app. you should probably actually ask someone about these products that actually knows about them.
5,XPvalkyrieXD,"Wonderful app, reasonable membership price and worth it. Informative on what ingredients are in the products and their effects backed with scientific research. I hope in the future that laundry detergents, protein drinks, and even pet foods are available to search. Also, even though ingredients are ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù it would be nice to read about what those are, their purpose, and what scientific research proves they are really risk free."
5,Playnthegame,"I try to feed my 4 year old as much healthy food as I can get him to try for his future benefit. When I started using Yuka I was shocked by the harmful chemicals in some of the name brand foods marketed towards children. I threw out a lot of products and now use this app to help make better choices. Thank you for this app, will be donating to the cause and contacting the FDA."
3,ssangyi,"I‚Äôve always been self conscious about things I put on my body and skin but with food it‚Äôs a little bit harder because they are able to label things organic that is still full of pesticides, biodegradable which isn‚Äôt real food or gmo it‚Äôs insane the regulations in this country vs others. As you can see I hate being forced to create an account before I can see what an app is about however so my rating reflects that developer need."
5,Cami-leon,I love this app. I last hours in stores just scanning items; it has become very therapeutic.  This is a must have app for sure. I was looking into the subscription price and I like how it has options to choose how much you‚Äôd like to pay a year. I believe it is so fair because you can tell how much work they put into the app.
4,Jean Swanson,I love how the app looks at the ingredients in the products we use. However the app uses nutritional guidelines to rate food and after years of learning about food. The ingredients of the food is most important in food as well as products. Please consider adding all ingredients to the food database as well. This app is not accurate for rating food‚Ä¶ I use it only for products. Great app tho!!!
5,Djmarkat,"I have been using this app for over a month now, payed for the 5 dollars yearly plan, and absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs great for knowing what to avoid and what to eat more of. It also tells you what is bad and what is good in beauty products! Overall a great and very helpful app for everyone who wants a healthier life!"
5,lisapach,This app has drastically changed what I put in my body and I look at many popular ‚Äúhealth‚Äù brands very differently. I recommend it to all my friends and family and they‚Äôre obsessed with it. My biggest fear is that big food corps will try to buy your integrity!!! Please stay true to your values and keep changing the food game in the US. It needs to change!! THANK YOU!
5,Monet87960,"I love Yuka and use it when I shop for groceries or cosmetics. I am surprised by how many products have been reviewed. Instead of having to read all the ingredients, I can instantly learn whether a product poses any health risks. I can also quickly find healthy alternatives, if the product I‚Äôm considering has toxic ingredients."
5,LisaBLV,This app has changed my life! My eating habits have changed for the better and I absolutely love that tgere are no sponsored ads or emails! The recommendations have been great too and I did the yearly subscription after using it for a month because I love be it so much! I have told many of my friends about it too!
5,JohannaW79,"Yuka plays such and important role in making transparent what‚Äôs in our food and hygiene products, thereby also putting pressure on producers to be health and environmentally focused instead of just profit driven. As a parent it also saves me so much time in researching what may be supportive of my family‚Äôs longterm health. Thank you for doing this work team Yuka! For us and our planet."
5,A_lwr,"Informative, fresh, easy, user, interface, easily understood by all ages, there‚Äôs so much you can say about this app. Thank you so much for actually caring for people. This app is about people for the people.  Donate, participate, give back to this app for all the wonderful research they do, and keeping us informed of all the things that are killing us slowly."
5,Bs602,"Great app, works excellent. The team sounds like a great bunch of people too. As a young cancer survivor this app is invaluable to me for assessing the foods I buy for my future health. Some of the risky additives allowed here in the USA are banned in Europe. This app makes it easy to stay away from that and choose cleaner food.. it helps give me a peace of mind. We only have one body, take care of it!"
5,ObelleP,"I love using this app so much, it allows me to see what‚Äôs coming in and out of my body because, health is so important to me.   I love that I found an app that give you real and factual information to educate us on what‚Äôs going into the products we use on a daily basis.   I hope everyone gets on this app soon enough."
1,mimiavo,"This app was pretty good a few months ago. Albeit not perfect but informative enough that I loved using it. Today I tried to look at products and most of the info is gone. It gives a rating & the list of ingredients, but no longer breaks down the reason for rating to be low or what some ingredients may cause issues with. I also found the exact same product listed twice (i got it a couple of months because of the app), one displayed an excellent rating and the other one displayed a poor rating. It just seems pointless now."
5,llllcccc1234,Ok so I REALLY LIKE THIS APP. I think everyone should have it and it is pretty fun. Though some times it will say something is poor and it‚Äôs because of 50 calories but other than that it‚Äôs really cool. My favorite thing about it is it will show you a better option when the app says it is poor or bad. I definitely recommend this app.
1,Meowwwwwwwwwwwwjdbdlamavx,"I decided to go through my food with my own eye tonight and see the ingredients in things. This app has missed so many toxic ingredients, not just a misstep on let‚Äôs say sodium content but leaving out additives that are Red going from mid 80‚Äôs to 40‚Äôs just from my simple update with the ingredients. Do your own research and with this app please double check when you scan stuff, im really disappointed, maybe as much in myself for just blindly trusting but I can not believe how much this was missing. Do your own research and use this as a check if still need be."
1,CS-Eric,"First of all, if you use this app to determine what you consume or what products you use, then you probably don‚Äôt eat or use anything.  Yuka will mark safe ingredients such as preservative (which are literally needed to keep products safe and usable) as moderate risk or hazardous. And in food, they will mark sodium or sugar as hazardous (which obviously it‚Äôs not healthy in high amounts but definitely nowhere near hazardous????)  This app doesn‚Äôt consider percentages in cosmetics or skincare so they just slap ‚Äúhazardous‚Äù on everything if the resource they used concluded that the ingredient might be unsafe in very high concentrations, even if it‚Äôs harmless in concentrations used. It‚Äôs very over exaggerated and inaccurate‚Ä¶  Maybe the app is not bad if you don‚Äôt look at product scores, or for people who have very specific diets, but scores and safety markings are trash and completely inaccurate and random."
5,Asataeger,"Yuka is a great app! Easy to use, intuitive, with the information I need for both food, drink, hygiene, and beauty products. Health and ingredients are hard to track‚ÄîYuka makes it easy with a great scanner.   I paid the extra one-time $10 fee for a bit more features. Definitely would pay it again‚Äîvery worthwhile."
5,vcbob,My coworker had this and told me about it‚Ä¶.I just downloaded it and went through all my ‚Äúdiet‚Äù food to find out it rated poor or bad‚Ä¶only about 20% was good or excellent. So that explains why I haven‚Äôt been able to shed pounds. That all changes now because of this outstanding app. I will be checking everything.  Thank you so much.
4,transmigrating,"If you have OCD or are a hypochondriac. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app is driving me insane, I found myself scanning literally everything and researching every single ingredient and what they do, you'll literally start throwing food away if you have OCD or severe hypochondria. This app is great for people with healthy brains who are trying to stay away from certain things or to keep their families healthy."
4,Fjfnsnfhk,This app is really amazing at breaking down ingredients and giving you information on what is inside and how it can affect you. The only down side is their swaps are inaccurate when it comes to many ethnic products like black hair care. For example I tried to find a swap for edge control and it was giving me a curly jelly instead. But overall it is good.
4,Slaemin,Hi I just started using this and so far i think it‚Äôs amazing! But i do have one suggestion. I‚Äôm one of those unlucky few people who are caffeine sensitive and I really wish this app could also tell me caffeine content in each product! That would make my life alot easier instead of googling it whenever I cant find it on bottles or boxes! But i do think this app is worth the download
5,Delta Craig,"I downloaded this tonight and I am obsessed! I have been scanning everything in my house. Luckily most of my food was excellent, but my beauty products, not so much. I LOVE the suggestions and I already used one to replace my body lotion. I am definitely going to donate for the yearly subscription.   Where has this been app been all of my life!? Thank you!"
5,Ihavenonicknamehehe,"I‚Äôve probably written 1-2 app reviews in my whole lifetime but this app definitely deserves one. It is amazing, easy to use and full with tons of nutritional information about daily products. Not just that but It recommends you substitutes with higher quality ingredients. Best of all its free version has lots of outstanding features. I 200% recommend!"
4,loading...... loading,"The app seems great if it‚Äôs accurate. The tweaks needed to allow this app to scan over the counter medicine shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. Many might even pay to help offset, if it‚Äôs not biased.  Keeping this info from the people any longer is not the cool thing to do. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to be the trail blazer of truth? Would be nice to see this added. Wonder if it‚Äôs even allowed yet.."
5,Guys hot,I watched a TikTok that recommended this app and it has lived up to all my expectations. It‚Äôs easy to use (all you do is scan the barcode) and you‚Äôll be given an easy to understand rating. They also include the specific ingredients you should avoid and have sources linked if you want to check for yourself.
5,CCCstrong,"While walking with a friend the other day, she mentioned this app.  I went home, downloaded it, became an instant premier member and have been addicted since the moment I downloaded it.  I‚Äôve been on a scanning frenzy in my home.  Love love love it!  Just recommended it to every friend I have as well as my grown children.  It‚Äôs amazing!  Don‚Äôt hesitate, download it asap!!!"
4,krevbot,Overall I think this app. The ease to which I can scan an item and see what it ACTUALLY has in it is great.   My one issue I take with it is that items with a lot of sugar still get rated pretty high. I think sugar is a major problem in the US (and maybe other countries as well) and leading to lots of diseases and obesity and we really need to think about how much sugar we consume.
5,Tio Josue,"Honestly we live in a great time of technology. Heard about this app yesterday, and my oh my, the app is extremely useful! Now I can know right away if a product is bad for you! Today just realized the lotion I bought a while back, is actually really bad for you. Thanks to the developers for making our lives easier, God bless!"
5,missmorganjenkins,"This app has changed the way I shop! I‚Äôm so grateful for it! One feature that would be amazing to see is a little note or icon next to products to let you know if the companies test on animals. When I‚Äôm deciding between products, sometimes I take this into consideration! Thanks so much!"
1,CourT from Boston,"I cannot get into my previously created account. There is a bug occurring when I tap my keychain to populate my password, it auto-populates the email field with my first name. I am then unable to interact with the email input to edit it to be my email credentials. Lastly, I attempted to reset my password but the recovery email never arrived. (I waited 10 mins- far too long if you ask me)  Additionally, the user experience upon login is cute but usability gets a 1. The tap state to slide the ui slider open, is far too small and I had to attempt it 3x to work."
5,Ë¶™Ëµ¥,"Americans are taking back control of their health and diet with the simple app. I encourage everyone to educate themselves about the food they eat and where it comes from. Support your local CSA. Eat food as it was meant to be eaten, local, seasonal, and organic methods, not frozen, or shipped 2,000 miles, doused in banned pesticides, and selected for size only (and not nutrition.)"
5,LeMieuxBoyz,"My friend suggested this app, and it has opened my eyes to healthier choices for myself and my family in regards to food and beauty products.   Many advertising campaigns make products appear to be healthy for you when, in actuality, the additives and their negative effects outweigh the positives listed on the product label.   I was shocked to realize my calcium supplement contained additives that prevent calcium absorption and metabolism.   I am sending this app to all of my friends and family and I thank you for what you‚Äôre doing to help us. Hopefully the FDA will also realize the importance of these necessary changes to improve the health of the world."
5,Cattle 2,If you are health conscious this app is for you! If you‚Äôre not you should be using this! I absolutely LOVE THIS APP. I have told so many people about this app. This is a must knowing what is in your food. I use it religiously at the store. So much my husband doesn‚Äôt like going with me because I scan every single item. My favorite app on my phone!
5,Kiki_123@,This app is so helpful! It helps you have a better diet and see what products and good for you and which products and bad for you. This app was a literal lifesaver! My mom loves this app too. She uses like 24/7. She loves more than me! I hope this helps you decide if you want to get this app. Bye! Also if your reading this have a great Day/Night! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
5,Angel_Acts,I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews on apps but my goodness I love this app. It tells you what ingredients are in something and if it‚Äôs bad or good. Then it‚Äôll recommend similar better products if it‚Äôs bad. It also makes a pie chart of the levels of good or bad on different products you own. It‚Äôs so helpful and I use it so often.
4,Nickname lassie,"I think this app is pretty great but it sometimes is out of context. I scanned my butter and it said it was bad because it was too fatty but butter is literally fat! It then compared it to peanut butter. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIt says something‚Äôs are bad because they have to much fat, sugar, and calories and if you care about that cool. I mostly use it to look for harmful additives and it works great. Still an awesome app."
5,amanda20000000,Everyone needs this app!! It is helping me get in peak health when it comes to cosmetics. I never realized how hazardous so many products are! I‚Äôm so grateful for an app like this to tell me the truth about what‚Äôs actually in all these products. I appreciate how the creators do not take any pay offs from brands wanting to promote or lie about their products and ingredients.
5,jungilover,I can‚Äôt believe all the products and food that I thought were safe are the opposite!  I am having a blast going through Walmart scanning things I buy. It has certainly opened my mind about how products are advertised as safe when they are the opposite. Get this app and see the food and beauty industries as they really are.
5,CozenedIndigo,"I‚Äôm so grateful for Yuka, the ease of accessing information related to what we put inside our bodies every single day, and doing it in a non biased way. I would gladly pay for the free version of this app and becoming a member doesn‚Äôt increase too many benefits but I‚Äôll do it to support what you‚Äôre doing. Well done."
5,xtviae,"I LOVE THIS APP. My family has multiple chemical sensitivity, which is an allergy to fragrance and other types of chemicals. usually, I have to do trial and error finding skincare products to find what doesn‚Äôt give me a burning/rashes out face. but this app tells you if there‚Äôs any fragrance, or whatever chemicals that could make u have a chemical reaction!!!! EXACTLY WHAT I NEED!!! 10/10 I LOVE YOU GUYS"
5,Someguy1212,Find out what toxic and harmful additives to ‚Äúfood‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù products these companies have been trying to hide from you!  Also you know these developers are onto something when the fake news outlets are saying how bad it is to know what you are consuming!
5,m r campbell,"Encouraged by our daughter, I downloaded the app & did my grocery shopping. I was shocked and delighted at the outcome. Things I had purchased for years were not really as ‚Äúhealthful‚Äù as advertised !  Shopping took me a bit longer but will develop better habits Michele 80 years old & planning on a longer life"
1,Desert Dweller 85,I am disappointed in this app. I bought hair products from the Aveda store that I searched for using the Yuka app and they were rated as excellent so didn‚Äôt scan them in the store. When I got home and scanned them they rated as poor. Yuka‚Äôs response to my inquiry was that there are 2 different formulations but there‚Äôs only one option at the store and online for the Rosemary Mint shampoo/conditioner. They said the products should be scanned in person but that defeats the purpose of the search feature and to purchase products online. I don‚Äôt trust their app.
1,Every person in the world,"While the app is effective by making the user aware of various harmful ingredients in different products, it fails to address the issue of bioengineered food. Foods that are bioengineered are unfit for human consumption, and therefore should be brought to the attention of the consumer and absolutely effect the ratings of products.   Not to mention the processing methods that go into the production of various foods are not addressed, only focusing on nutritional values and harmful additives.   We must take into consideration any and all factors that will negatively impact our health, including bioengineered foods and harmful methods of production in order to obtain as complete an understanding as possible as for  what our diets should look like.   There are certain helpful aspects of the app but ultimately you're left feeling as if you understand and are on top of your health, when in reality you're just another misinformed consumer."
5,heyminnie,"I was just told about this app today.  Scanned my go to lotion only to see it‚Äôs poor rating, I will be trying the alternative recommendation.  Also scanned products at the grocery store and was able to find healthier choices.  Thank you so much for all the hard work that went into this app.  I love it."
5,2wicked4u2,"I would like to think that I have been eating healthy for the last few years. NOT SO!! I‚Äôm so grateful for this app!! Things I thought were healthy, like seeded Keto bread, or carb balance tortillas, or fiber one bars, turned out to have nasty chemicals I would rather not put into my body!  Now I have a quick way to prescreen things before they land in my cart!! Thanks Yuka!!"
5,dankskibidi,"I love the app it‚Äôs great the only thing I don‚Äôt like is that they block their convenience features for membership buying users. Other than that it‚Äôs great app, you just have to overlook the nicer features if you don‚Äôt want to pay their membership prices to unlock them."
5,Stop C,"I think it‚Äôs great, I must re-think the choices that I make when it comes to what to eat. And how to feed my family, so that we eat to live, and not live to eat. This is my motto from the seventies. I must re-think what‚Äôs in my food closet and make a better plan. This App will help me to make the best choices for my family. ‚ÄúI Pray! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Connor R. L.,"I heard about this app from a relative. I haven‚Äôt ever fallen in love with a useful app so quickly. Products appear quickly, with descriptions for why certain products can be harmful or toxic. This is a new staple app that anyone seeking to improve their health must have. No media bias, just straight facts on products and ingredients. I‚Äôd highly recommend to anyone."
5,YogiOne,I LOVE this app. I downloaded it while I was on vacation in Europe and I‚Äôve been using it for all sorts of food stuff ever since. I am amazed at all the additives I find in the products I once was consuming. I live plant-based whole food lifestyle and this app has been a game changer for buying and bringing in foods that align with my manner of living.
5,@alexandra.rae.lv,"I absolutely LOVE the yuka app.  Nothing is hidden. If you‚Äôre looking to optimize your health, look no further. The yuka app does an amazing job doing the hard stuff. It allows us, the consumer, to quickly learn whether or not a product is actually high quality or not. No more being mislead by false advertising.  Quality ingredients >>>>. Thank you Yuka!"
5,Day Blind Stars,"I was unaware how many of the products I use day to day were at best unhealthy and at worst hazardous. I have sent this app to friends and family and now we are all sharing information and discovering the cleanest, healthiest products, and breaking free of the marketing that has done a number on us for a lifetime."
3,CerealGuy65,"I like to try to eat healthier so it‚Äôs useful. I don‚Äôt like that it counts calorie heavy things as bad. I have a high metabolism and a very physically demanding job. If I don‚Äôt eat over 3,000 calories I start dropping weight very quickly so I tend to eat calorie dense foods. I wish that was customizable. I know every person is different and most are not in my situation but it would be nice if it didn‚Äôt list calorie dense as bad for me, since I‚Äôd waste away without it."
4,Ideas1234,This is awsome. I love the app but let me cut to the chase here. I really think it needs to be able to have a test you can take on your skin type. For the skincare products. Sometimes things work for some people but not others! Please do this ‚ù§Ô∏è I love this app it‚Äôs so nice to see what‚Äôs going on my face and in my body but listen to my suggestion it would make the app a 5/5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è
3,Chvrry2k,"I really liked this app at first, however after a while I noticed when i try to look up certain brands they will have the same product repeatedly (with the same rating‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs legit, but just annoying). They also don‚Äôt have as many reviews for products that aren‚Äôt American or European. It‚Äôs not as organized as it should be and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs due to lack of funding or something else."
5,Its Your Poppa,"After using Yuka for little over half a year now, I can say that it is amazingly helpful!   Lots of the products I‚Äôd been eating/drinking had so much terrible ingredients in it and with Yuka it helped me find and figure out healthy alternatives to the food/drinks I was using.   Yuka - (5/5) stars, very easy to use and simple for most people to navigate!"
5,Omq._.ItzAMadUser,This app has actually changed my life. No other app will give you recommendations for the poor/bad food you own other than Yuka. My food is so much more healthier now and because it‚Äôs healthier now I feel so much better about what I‚Äôm eating and also I feel so much healthier without the risks of hazardous additives. Great app!
5,Fredforfood,My daughter just had a baby and concern about good food to feed him. She goes to grocery store and scan the item that she‚Äôll buy. No need to read the content label of the item. Must have if you are health conscious and watching your health. I use it now and quickly changed few things what to eat
5,üêüFishyKissesüêü,"This has been a great app but, as with any consumer entered database, it‚Äôs only as good as the person entering the information.  If it seems too good to be true, scan and check for yourself!  Correct information when you find errors!!!  Let‚Äôs keep the integrity of this app worthy of its cause!"
5,lovechicfila,"I truly love this Yuka app. I use it to scan everything when I'm shopping for food and cosmetics. It recommends alternative products incase something is bad or poor. I share it every chance I get with family, friends, and total strangers. They love it and give great feedback about using it. You are a genius!!!! Absolutely 5* rating. Carlyl"
5,DMad11,"Our family use Yuka every time we are shopping, we have a new verb in our dictionary; YUKA. We Yuka everything before putting it in the cart. It also a very helpful tool to convince the kids of better ‚Äúcandy‚Äù options and avoid the junk in stores. Thank you so much and keep up the good work"
4,b.w.888,"It‚Äôs a very good app I‚Äôve recommended it to many friends in the past, only reason why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because if you wanted to look up a product & it doesn‚Äôt have the barcode on it you‚Äôd have to look it up but to do that you have to be a member. Other than that yuka is indeed a helpful app if the barcode is intact or on the product!"
5,Vlharvey,I am really loving this app! So helpful and surprised at products I thought were healthy and it really isn‚Äôt.  Especially like the detailed explanations of ingredients and what the moderate and harmful ones do to your body.  I am wondering if the app can flag if a food is GMO or not? That would be a great addition and would take it over the top for me!
2,thefuturemrssmart,"I purchased the premium option to help support this small business. I was diagnosed with skin cancer among a few other health issues this year and decided it was time for a lifestyle change. I wanted to be more cognizant of the stuff I put inside and on my body. I‚Äôve been using the Yuka app to help make informed decisions, especially steering clear of products that contain ingredients of known carcinogens. Unfortunately I‚Äôve found this app to be inconsistent with product ingredient list."
5,Bankaiabel,A friend of mine installed this app on my phone and told me that will be the best gift he could give me and man was he right it‚Äôs a must have for everyone not only you will make better choices in healthy eating and also you will be more educated about what we are really consuming . Thanks a lot guys for this app üëäüôè.
5,Junebugh22,"The only thing I would suggest is adding prices, especially to alternatives. The reason I get the products I do is price above almost all else, but if there‚Äôs a healthier alternative, I would love to know the price difference without having to look it up every time. Everything else is great!!"
5,Mara Leana,"Since downloading the app I have significantly improved on the quality of products I buy. What I like the most about the app is that so far it is free AND when scanning is returned as poor or bad, YUKA will give you (in most cases) a list of alternatives. I have become an advocate for this app. I wish I had discovered it earlier on."
5,Melio09161993,"This app has changed so much for me but I need to review because I discovered a cool feature today. If someone else scans an item and shared it with you, that item is added to YOUR history. I love that!!! Now my family and friends can share excellent products with me and it‚Äôs saved for me to refer to later! Love it so much!"
5,PB&J12,"Absolutely love this app I love that I can read the ingredients and and can kind of just skim any food I‚Äôd like and see how bad it is, not just food though put all my body wash and shampoo‚Äôs I have curly hair, so see what products have what? In their shampoo and conditioners really helps as well. I take this about any time I‚Äôm at the grocery store.ü§é"
2,dani.333,"Wow I did like the app, but‚Ä¶ I received this email‚Ä¶‚Äù I had to close your account due to one of the following: - You added non-food products to the app - You modified a product by entering incorrect values - You added a product of which no nutritional value was indicated, and therefore entered fictitious values‚Äù  So because I thought adding a dog treat would help the community I got blocked from the app. I figured dog food when be considered food. It‚Äôs not like I was trying to do something bad. Omg what kind of company does that?"
5,MrsZDP,"I had no idea all of the additives food has. Labels that appear to be the ‚Äòbest‚Äô are anything but. If you‚Äôre on a journey to getting more healthy ‚Äòwhole‚Äô foods in your home, this app is a must! I also recommend becoming a member so you can use the ‚Äòsearch‚Äô feature and offline mode. I enjoyed the free version but the member version is awesome!   Thanks Yuka!"
5,Mike Bowden,My wife has been suffering from inflammation; we think it is an autoimmune disorder. We started using Yuca to scan all the food we purchased and were astonished at how horrible everything we ate was. It has made a massive difference in how she feels daily by ensuring she stays away from foods that cause inflammation. Thank you!
2,TangoUnited,"Live in USA. Surprised myself finding that the reports are inaccurate lately and missing key active ingredients. Scan a bunch of sunscreen products for example they will get low grades or high grades. Investigate the low grades come from ingredients that are present in the other products, but yuka missed that ingredient. This is just one example but same with energy bars etc‚Ä¶ Too many inaccuate matches lately! Also the ‚ÄúUpdate UI‚Äù is not usable. That feature not ready to be customer facing."
5,happy thoughts ;),"Can you make the buttons on the bottom bigger? And the bigger? When I was showing my dad how to use the program he can't see the icons, or the text to figure out how to scan products. I have to do this every time with him. Make the buttons bigger!"
5,K@PP@1234,"One of my coworkers recommended this app to me and I decided to try it. I had no idea how bad my makeup was for me! I just bought all new makeup! Seriously, try this app and see what is going on your face! I love that when you scan or search for a product and it is bad they will give you cleaner recommendations!"
5,onoretry,I JUST found out about the app and am truly amazed at the wealth of information!!  To see the ingredients in a simplistic way and understand whether they are harmful or not is surely to be life changing!  One of my favorite features is the fact that they give you alternatives to the item you are inquiring about. So very helpful!!  I joined as a member the same day I discovered the app (something I very seldom do) in order to support this company‚Äôs endeavors. Being able to type in the specific name of a product is an added bonus to the membership.   Good luck Yuka‚Ä¶and thank you for teaching us to be health conscious! üíñ
5,Lexi N. C.,Yuka is literally a life-changer! I can now easily assess different food and cosmetic products before I make a purchase. I also appreciate the alternative recommendations. The App is designed well and easy to use too. Thank you! It shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to make healthy choices!
5,FangOfDrknss,"This is the kind of million dollar idea that Jian Yang from Silicon Valley tried to do, but couldn‚Äôt figure out, so kudos to the devs for doing so. My current girlfriend and I use the app to scan stuff at Whole Foods when shopping there, so it would be nice if you could add a share scan feature."
1,Skittlep,"i have tried to use the yuka app to see how harmful my ingredients in my products were. the ingredient lists didn't have any actual proof that could cause any of the issues involved in the products. not to mention, many of the products have small amounts of the harmful substance in them and couldn't cause big problems in the future. sorry, but you couldn't pay me all the money in the world to use this app ever again. it makes false claims and shows proof that this isn't a reliable source. (xoxo, from a biochemist)"
5,Me Joan you know who,Wow. Amazing app and amazing mission by this company to aid consumers in the war against these crazy companies that put all sorts of crap into our food and cosmetics. We chose to pay the highest subscription price just to support them in hopes they can continue to expand the database and bring more awareness. Thanks for doing this Yuka
5,No fake food,As a Registered Nurse and Clinical Nutrition Consultant this  app goes above what similar apps offer plus is very easy to use. Thank you for the newest feature to help make our voices heard directly to the manufacturers. Yuka is a very good tool to help teach people to make cleaner food choices in the products they choose to purchase.
1,nataliaf23,This app i was trilled at first but then i bought a product that was rated exelent amd it happend my worst nightmare the product i bought was the worst product almos give me a heart attack and also does ro my husband because it was rated exelent and i went buy it and then fin out it has 500 mo of caffeine more than redbull we almost die people do not base this app on a real information do your own research before buying food this app rate food that are actually bad as exelent and food that is exelent as bad so thus is why i do not recomend this app to anyone
5,Sejanus42,"This was suggested by a friend, and I‚Äôm glad I downloaded it. This has been very helpful when we are shopping with the family. The only way to get big food to change how they operate is for people to change their purchasing habits. Thanks for the app!"
5,JoshS72,My family has used to this app to eliminate lots of bad (in some cases hazardous) foods and cosmetics from our home. Better dietary choices when I‚Äôm traveling (I‚Äôm vegan) when looking for snacks - don‚Äôt have to spend time carefully reviewing the ingredients list to figure out food quality.  One request - please add supplements!
5,Fredmeyer1234,"New favorite app! I heard about this on Joe Rogan & Shawn Ryan. I love that it keeps my search history and I love love love that it gives better recommendations for the not so healthy products. Also love the transparency in the research information for harmful additives. This is just a thoughtfully put together, extremely useful tool for anyone!"
5,Violet1916,"I almost never write reviews but i appreciate this app so much, I had to come and leave then a review. It the word of creative marketing, sometimes we just don‚Äôt know what is really good and healthy for us to consume. This app helps so much. I love how it also make suggestions on alternative products. Thanks !"
5,Mrs. Furness,This is a great app. I love how they break down every ingredient & explain every ingredient in any item. It‚Äôs a wonderful app that I‚Äôve been using since the beginning. I use it at every grocery visit. Love love love this app. It is wonderful.
3,some asn kid,"Should be able to look up items with a screenshot of the ingredients. And publish them the same. Many of us are shopping online, not scanning items in a store. App should implement AI to see if ingredients are good or not without scanning barcodes. Also, some items are inaccurately rated because some miss a few ingredients, the same product will be labeled ""poor"" AND ""excellent"" in two different posts"
5,liv / aspenking :),I love this app because it really helped me change my life around in knowing what bad ingredients are and what to look out for and what these ingredients even do. I appreciate this app so much because brands you would think are good for you aren‚Äôt! There is so much false advertising in the beauty industry this app is a must have.
3,Akswmmom,This is a great app for products already rated. I paid for the upgrade and it does not add much. Trying to add a new product is dysfunctional and most often the required photo function does not work properly.   Would be good to just be able to fill in info from the label instead  of photo.  Overall it is helpful but many products do need to be added.
1,-BMD,"If you're like me and everybody else and got this because of TikTok to check all of your makeup and skincare. Well beware that you don't need to get rid of a product just because it is seemingly bad. Most of the ingredients deemed bad are most of the times ingredients that you'd have to have an intense amount at once to even cause any type of reaction or do any damage. I've seen products recommended by dermatologists get low ratings, trust the professionals. I also recommend watching videos by cosmetic chemists that talk about the app and why it isn't the best."
5,megan9876,"I recently became aware of toxins put in food sold in the USA, but not allowed in other countries.  I discovered Titanium dioxide in my vitamins, pumpkin seeds and other foods before a friend shared this app.    Thank you and God bless you for making it so easy to know which foods actually contain poisonous additives!  I will use it for every item I purchase."
5,GKPyle23,I‚Äôm skeptical in regards to apps and such but let me tell you‚Ä¶ this is a phenomenal tool if you want to invest in your health and well-being. I‚Äôve fought cancer and I have 2 autoimmune diseases. I wish this app would‚Äôve been around years ago. Everything we ingest has a potential consequence. Using this app will be so enlightening.
5,kali_sunshine,"I have shared this app with DOZENS of people and almost all of them have added the app and use it now. It definitely gives you a better perspective of what you put in your body.   We use this app every store we go to. A lady even stopped and asked why I got excited after scanning a product. I told her it as because I found a üíØ.  If you care about what you eat, you should definitely download this app. Watching sodium? Download the app. Watching sugar? Download the app. Curios what hazardous materials you‚Äôre eating? Download the all.   Basically - go download the app and make a positive, conscious healthy change."
3,ywathen,I was introduced to this app by my sister who used it daily. She is on an Organic holistic diet and this has helped her a lot. I am only beginning and needed to have lots of info on the products I use. Sadly many of the items I scanned in my house were not rated. I'm very interested on cleaning products and body creams/makeup but nothing yet. Hope you keep updating especially for Carcinogens or toxic ingredients.
4,seijo10,"This is my first time writing a review, but you guy‚Äôs really deserved it. I‚Äôm amazed and great full for this app, I always go to the internet and look up the ingredients of the products I buy. But WOW!!!!!! Thanks again. I hope this app can integrate the pet‚Äôs products also, since they deserve the same treatment has we humans.  I didn‚Äôt give them a 5 star just because of the absence of pet products."
5,Lorylymn,Great to use for everything you buy to use on your body or eat. Revolutionary. Really a game changer for making healthy choices. Changing what I eat everyday because I‚Äôm learning from this app what is really in my food and given other better healthier options.
3,AnanabAnanab,The thing I liked about this app was the detail information about the ingredients. The thing I really dislike is that they let a lot of bad ingredients slip by and say it‚Äôs healthy or kind of healthy. Nothing is kind of healthy in my book. It‚Äôs either good for you or it‚Äôs not. If you scan the same item on Bobby Approved it either says good or bad. There‚Äôs no in between. So it makes me question the reliability of the Yuka app.
5,DCDAL66,Just became a user and it‚Äôs already helped me to make better food choices. I threw out items in my pantry and fridge that I thought was healthy or even ok but they were not. I‚Äôm glad to have the assistance of this information so that I can make better decisions on how and what I‚Äôm spending my money on.
5,stellbel,"I am making better and healthiest choices when shopping. This app provides a lot of useful information and insight to what I am really eating. I have a few friends that downloaded it. The suggestion was made to me, by my chiropractor. Thank you, I am eating better and enjoy food now."
5,One-a-day,This app has made shopping tasks so much easier and enjoyable. It has also helped us make better choices while grocery shopping. Not only does it rate the product but it also give an alternative if needed. This will definitely be a well used app.
5,LaurieSH,I think the app is amazingly helpful for making better choices.  I truly hope that with founders moving to America that pressure can be put on government and corporations to stop using awful chemicals and dyes.  I‚Äôm so tired of not having a voice and trying to navigate what is a good choice. Yuka has been so helpful.
4,Pocky-desu,"Very useful app, you scan a product and it tells you about the good & the bad in it. Plus if the score is low on an item it gives you a recommendation. My only issued with this app is that I encountered a product with erroneous information and I‚Äôve tried to upload the ingredient list but it doesn‚Äôt let me fix the information."
5,Wallywest12,This application is absolutely incredible. It has such a large database of different foods and snacks and  not only does it tell you whether your selection is good or not it even provides alternatives which is great! I even used it to get some good sunscreen. Absolutely fantastic!
5,Ben-LDC,My son shared this app with me. I use this app in the grocery store. It helps me rethink  the foods that are not good for my overall health. I have been eating bad for 40+ years and I really need this motivation. I am a stubborn person so constant reminders help me tremendously. I scan items and Yuka shows me healthy replacements. Thank you Yuka!
3,urmompennywise,"Whenever I go shopping with my sister she uses this app, I downloaded it just today! I used it on products that I use daily and help me a lot (such as; body wash; shampoo; conditioner; moisturizer; cleanser; etc) these things have helped me achieve smoother skin, healthier skin, and more. The app shows them as poor, I‚Äôm guessing that it differs on the person but I‚Äôm unsure of why it scans it as it‚Äôs so poor but it helps me and others as well."
5,psxcancer,"This APP is beyond what I expected.  I feel so informed now about what I eat, drink, wash with and other chemicals I use around the house.  Great functionality. They even offer alternatives to what you scanned.  The Cat is out the bag, I hope more people use this and hold theses companies accountable for this unfit for human consumption (so called) food."
5,Tigressized273,"I downloaded this app, and within 5 minutes I had rooted out all the bad things in my food. The mac and cheese I was eating could have actually given me kidney or liver failure! It also got rid of some  of my stereotypes about what foods were healthier, and now I can make better decisions about what I eat!"
5,whyseverysinglenicknametaken??,I love this app. It genuinely makes it a lot easier when picking out cosmetics and things like that. I found out the shampoo i was using was actually terrible for my hair and switched to a better one! I think it would be really cool if you guys could do things for animals. Like they‚Äôre food and shampoos and stuff!
5,Feryfairy,"A dear friend introduced me to this app, since became a member have started to change many products in my fridge, bathroom, and self care. When I go shopping you see me scanning any item I want to buy and the best part is that if the product is no good they always write the reason and  recommend a better alternative which is not any more expensive or hard to get. Also I receive very informative emails from Julie, Marie & other staff‚Ä¶regarding eating healthy and very nutritious, easy making recipes. I  recommend it to my friends and family 100%  Thanks YUKAüíùüå∑ Fery"
3,KGC0188,"Definitely 5 stars if there was a way to make personal adjustments to daily intake, main one is salt, the other is saturated fat. I was with the masses a few years ago ‚Äúsalt is terrible for you‚Äù. I‚Äôve done years of research, salt is a necessity, I have my blood work done regularly, it has improved with increased salt consumption.  From their website: ‚ÄúSalt should be limited in any case from a nutritional point of view‚Äù This is incorrect."
5,Tkaylor,"We don't buy ANYTHING without scanning first.  We have adopted our 3 year old grandson and he has a BAD food dye sensitivity. This app allows me to weed out the LITERAL POISON and make healthy, dye free choices. Plus all the other great stuff (or terrible depending on how you look at it).  I am so grateful for this app!!!  I hope our government will download it ü•¥"
5,Emiley Anne,I love this app so much however I can‚Äôt help but wish there was also an app like this that would tell us what good pet foods and treats would be good for our furry little friends. Thanks Yuka for helping me make better life choices during this weightloss journey
5,Jenna Drusen,"This app has helped me in so many ways. My family and I were not aware all of the awful chemicals that were in simple lotions and toiletries. Luckily, this app exists to tell us what is slowly harming our bodies and what we can use instead. Thank you for making this!"
5,Jorden1337,Great app! I love that if you scan something bad you get recommended a product that is much better for you! It also tells you why the products ingredients are bad and what they can possibly cause! Thank you to the creators of this app!
5,Sheegofa,"This app demystify‚Äôs the question of what toxic chemicals are in the things you put in and on your body. It‚Äôs freaking amazing!! It provides established recommendations for already screened top rated products for purity, and discloses the contents of thousands of products you are considering buying. It‚Äôs magic for living a cleaner healthier lifestyle."
5,Rochesweeney,"After maybe 2 weeks from my sons diagnose he started to understand the importance of diet and been a 16 years old this was a huge milestone. Yuka has been fundamental in this change. It makes it easy for him to understand the nutritional value, additives, and sugar in foods. He always goes to Yuka to find alternatives to his favorite foods."
5,mellahbellahü•≥,I have been on this app for 3 months now and this is the best as a child and this app could change so many people lives right now because the stuff I‚Äôm now scanning everything I see because you never now when something could have hazardous ‚ö†Ô∏è in it.
5,RogerIguana,I‚Äôve been using the App now for about 6 months. This App may not have changed my life but made it very easy for me to shop for healthy foods and drinks. I can just aim at the barcode and get a score instead of trying to read the whole label.  I will definitely recommend
5,kcaroleb,I just love this app! I‚Äôm not a big health food person but I am trying to put more thought into eating better. I can‚Äôt believe how many times I stood in the store reading labels and just giving up. With this app I simply scan the item and it helps me make better choices. Congratulations to the developers!
5,Mittsb,"I‚Äôm obsessed with this app, I‚Äôm so use to eating junk food seeing the nasty chemicals used in everything I eat has made me change my whole diet. This app can serious save people from getting cancer! Seriously life changing, made me be cautious on what foods & makeup to buy. Thank you this app is a blessing üôè"
5,Missak15,I have been using this app so much I became a member just to support whoever is behind this app. It has changed what is in my fridge. 95% is Good- Excellent (I try to find the excellent but I don‚Äôt have a whole foods near me so that can be tricky) I do have a little dark chocolate in my house. Even my sweet is only ‚Äúpoor‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúbad‚Äù
5,Cdmoliq,I honestly use this app every time I go to the grocery store.  It helps me make better decisions on the food I am putting in my body.  Even if something is not in the database it‚Äôs so easy to add a new product.  The app uses your camera to analyze the nutritional facts and ingredients.  Give it a shot you will be impressed.
5,KEPCMK,"Very convenience, and it seems extremely reliable. I feel I have more control over the levels of toxicity and quality of nutritious items  that I consume. I have actually been unpleasantly surprised by a lot of the items I believed to be healthy. In general, it‚Äôs easy to use and very helpful."
5,Melabie53,"It‚Äôs pretty hard to research the ingredients of products while you‚Äôre trying to shop and sometimes you don‚Äôt realize until after you‚Äôve bought it that there‚Äôs a toxic ingredient. This app is extremely helpful and a godsend, thank you!"
1,Nicknameatron,"I just read a review that says the app doesn‚Äôt evaluate ingredients? When will it evaluate poisonous ingredients? What‚Äôs the hold up? Our society is inundated by poisonous ingredients. The addictive properties and destruction created by these ingredients outweigh any negativity coming from caloric intake. Are there at least sugar warnings? I‚Äôm not sure. I even care about that question it says it right on the label. What is it just another marketing data collection scam? Manufactures association paying for this? I hate asking these questions, but welcome to 2024 and everything you created."
5,Tracy chicken,I never knew how much hazardous material is on the food we eat and the products we put on our skin!  I just wish they would expand and include wine.  I understand wine makers put unnecessary additives in their wine.  This app could help us make better choices.  Hope the owner reads this and considers expanding this very valuable app!
5,Fashbina,"I am really loving this app! I am learning a lot, and it is super easy to use- my favorite part is that it gives you healthier alternatives immediately to improve your choices‚Ä¶ the information provided about the additives in food is most enlightening- thanks for developing such a great app!"
5,Jimmy we,As a heart patient I have found this app to be a great  asset for buying food that is good for me. Foods that I had been buying that I thought were good for me but turns out no so much.   I‚Äôm not all that great with electronics and I wanted to sign up for your premium membership but am not seeing the link to do that.   Thank you
5,bearbrooke,"One of the best apps around!  I use it every time I go shopping and have also shared this app with many of my friends.  Occasionally I find some inconsistencies on some of the scanned products and in the future will take the time to let the developer know, but overall a great app."
5,bryanhamner,"This app has been doing me a lot of good I‚Äôm of the understanding that they do not take funding from corporate entities  I hope this is true, and it seems to be pretty unbiased and even customizable. I don‚Äôt eat soy and it has helped me so much  Much easier to read in the small print on mini product packages"
5,rainygee17,"I can not believe how is app has helped me discover what is in our products that we eat,  and put on our bodies. I thank the hard working people behind this amazing app help educating  people like myself. I‚Äôve been telling lots of people about this app. It‚Äôs so important that we know what‚Äôs actually inside our products.   Since using this app,  I‚Äôve changed a lot of food and body products that I use on a daily basis. We buy things that says healthy,  but when you actually scan the ingredients, you see whats good, and if there is hazardous chemicals in it.  Great job everyone!! Thank you! Rainy Gee"
5,Kav Meh,Everyone needs awareness on what we are  putting in/or our bodies. There is tons of harmful substances in different materials that we consume. Being healthy starts with what you put in your body and this app gives you full awareness and includes different studies from multiple countries. It‚Äôs a lifesaver!
5,fraudastheelection,"I love this app because it makes it easy for you to see the toxic and unhealthy stuff in all of the cosmetics and foods we use. It‚Äôs easy to use and I think the interface works very well. I hope sometime we can see them add stuff like laundry detergent, softeners, soaps, and more!"
5,ms154131,"This is my favorite app and it has changed my life. I tell everyone to download it. I trust the information because they do not pay influencers or pay for ads. I have made adjustments to my diet and skincare regimen and feel so much better about my shopping decisions. Thank you, Yuka!"
5,Uncle-e,"After getting this app, my wife and myself, our whole life has been turned upside down because we found out a lot of the stuff that we were putting in our bodies had additives that were toxic to our well-being. Thank you"
5,GinaG711,"Yuka is amazing making every day shopping so easy to navigate. Yuka does all the work for you, no more  hours wasted reading small hard to read ingredient lists! Just scan and get your rating along with easy to read and understand list of dangerous ingredients and how they affect your body! Love it!!"
5,mrs. lehrry,This app is absolutely amazing! I have learned so much about what is in our foods and beauty products. EVERYONE NEEDS THIS APP! Thank you to the creators for making this app and providing the public with this educational resource. I hope it really creates some big changes in the way we make and market products.
5,JoDjo62,Thank you so much for this app. It has changed the way I shop and become more aware of the ingredients ai feed my family and the products we used. I am addicted to this app and just became a member to be able to search for products by name. Thank you!
5,GalacticCupcake,There is a wide range of information on almost any product you can find. Yuka is a well-needed app that can make staying healthy much easier. I scanned a can of Monster and IT told me exactly what the bad parts were with a small blurb. Extremely helpful!!
5,unlucky potato,how is this app free? It‚Äôs literally so good and does not have a limit and you can literally scan everything it‚Äôll show you everything you need to know it‚Äôs absolutely so brilliant and so beneficial to have I couldn‚Äôt say more how much I love this app please get it and support the developer because they made it for free.
5,connorado,"Yuka has changed the way I shop. I‚Äôll never buy a cosmetic or toiletry product unless it has a good score on Yuka again. It‚Äôs so easy to search and filter out unhealthy products. I just wish there were more products in the app, and a better system for food."
5,BellaüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπ,I always use this app before purchasing any lotions or shampoos etc now because it gives the real facts about what‚Äôs in what you‚Äôre buying! Even if something says it‚Äôs vegan it can still have crazy irritants and other things so this is wonderful to sort out the real from the fake!
4,Smartecookie,"This is preferable to Think Dirty as it is independent. I like to use both thus and the EWG Healthy Living App in tandem, I think that provides a good amount of data.   One quick note for Yuka: your app icon is almost identical to Instacart, and also visually suggests that you only cover food. Judging from the graphic I would never guess that you also cover personal care products."
5,Tpot.noc,"Want to eat healthier? This app does all the thinking for you. The interface is extremely user friendly, and is helps me choose better foods. It even allows you to callout manufacturers responsible for unhealthy, high-risk additives in the food. App helps increase consumer awareness."
5,Baerona78,Hello I love Yuka so much I am a teenage girl that was really influenced but TikTok and underconseption core and it made me sad I couldn‚Äôt be like the other TikTok girls and I wanted to take care of my hair and found out that I was using the wirnbg products thank you you saved my hair but in the new update why aren‚Äôt they the best thing it disappeared
5,Sk!nc@r3 ROCKKKSS!,It scans and rates everything! Well not everything but basically everything. But if it‚Äôs not available then it will ask you to fill out the information and adds a rating quickly.
5,Cincodemayomama,"This app makes it so easy to quickly scan barcode and get important information about products fast. I‚Äôm excited that they are going to add more categories in the future, hoping they add micro plastics from the food containers. Thank you for creating this. It‚Äôs amazing."
5,J12455334,"I have never written an app review before which is a testament to how life changing this app has been for me. Kudos to the developer and creator of this‚Äîit‚Äôs brilliant, easy to use, and provides true transparency. Yuka makes me a more responsible consumer and I feel way more educated on what to stay away from. Thank you!!!!"
5,Shatternerve,"The Yuka app has shown itself to be important to the health of my family. The knowledge that I have extracted from the use of this app has prevented much exposure to toxins that we were routinely exposed to. I feel like we're doing everything we can to prevent disease and the recipes are very inspiring, delicious and healthy."
5,Lavruyar,"This app is absolutely amazing. Helps toy with what to eat, what to put on yourself to look healthier, bless those people who created this. One of the best apps any category wise in the entire world. However one thing I wanted to add was a recommendation for another category in Beauty for sunscreens. Otherwise this app is flawless"
5,":83:$:$:$,$,8;;$!./8-@/&;&:&","When I use that I scanned Chapstick, and now I know the truth behind everything in the ingredients that is contained inside the product he doesn‚Äôt only do that it will help everything and you have a search button if you don‚Äôt own the item yet"
5,Tpelowski,I have learned so much from this ap. Most food is garbage pretty much sums it up. We are what we eat. Disease grows in toxic environments. Eat pure foods and heal. This tool is a must for any family to navigate the lies in the grocery stores. Thank you for giving us this tool to determine the good from the bad.
4,nikki0728,"I like the app, very informative on what has good or bad ingredients. The one thing I wish it did and why I‚Äôm giving it 4 Stars is because I would like it to recommend alternatives. Trying to find alternatives is time consuming and overwhelming and if it maybe offered other options for an item, that would be helpful."
5,Waterlilymd2003,Everyone that is concerned about what they put in their bodies needs this app!! Just scan a product and it will tell you if it‚Äôs good for your body. If it‚Äôs not it will give you a suggestion as to what to purchase. Just loving this. Good eating couldn‚Äôt be any easier. Highly recommend this!!!!!
5,"""skinny legend""","This app is so convenient when purchasing any products or food! I always wanted to know if what I‚Äôm getting is good for me or not, but i was too lazy to research what things to look for in ingredients. This does it for you and provides resources to back up the information. Most convenient app."
5,VJay55,"It‚Äôs a wonderful app that I wish everyone should have. Incredibly helpful to decide the products across brands from Shampoo to Milk. I can't thank you and your team in putting out your self less efforts that address the most important thing in every one's life , that is health."
5,JoJoShutty,This app is a game changer! What an awesome way to ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äú! I have shared it with many many friends and people in stores. It will help you make a decision on which food and beauty products are healthier than others. The monthly support emails from Julie are great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
5,michelegoll,I absolutely love everything about this app. It was referred to me by my daughter-in-loce and I just can‚Äôt thank her enough and I tell everybody that I can how wonderful this app is and it truly helps me make decisions while I‚Äôm shopping about if I‚Äôm going buy this or if my going buy that.
5,Ceecee z,i love this app i have had it before but i got a new phone and all my apps reset and im trying to log in and every email i use which is mine my moms dads sisters it says that the email is in use so and also the only season i rated it 5 stars is cause i want people to see my review thank you!
5,Grxpy,"I have always been a label reader, but sadly, companies are not required to put everything on the label. Much of this info is hidden because it is tremendously unsafe to consume or use. The great people at Yuka make this vital information available to us! Thanks Yuka For making life better for us all!"
5,BurnettTN,"Here‚Äôs an app a dietitian friend shared. You scan any barcode packaging in your grocery or box store, it will tell you the nutrition value and gives a rating 0-100 if it's a healthy choice.  To me it's been fascinating as well as enlightening and has several times influenced my purchases. Highly recommend!"
5,RozelynnMcK,I absolutely love this app it‚Äôs helped me better my life and my health in many ways but there‚Äôs definitely some improvements that need to be made such as I highly recommend a leader board where you can see the top rated products in each category
3,Live4Christ64,"I was impressed with the app in the beginning but starting notices many inconsistencies with their rating of several items. I‚Äôve sent them several emails asking for clarification but haven‚Äôt heard back from anyone. Simply put, I can‚Äôt tell who is actually doing the rating on each item. Is it the app or merely individuals? I would appreciate a response from the creator please."
1,cara lynne,"I expected to have to give my email to get a free app, but I didn't expect that it would then limit the app SO much without subscribing. I can only look up a few categories, and even then it only shows a few ""top"" items in pre-selected categories. I don't need to see peanut butters and granolas, I make those myself - I downloaded the app for other categories. The way the app is marketed shows none of these restrictions, but this app cannot be used without paying. Cheap bait & switch."
5,Kyle Galaz,"I was at the gas station getting my daily favorite protein bar that I‚Äôve been consuming for the last 5 years, I decided to use Yuka to scan it‚Ä¶. It scored a ZERO!! I will never eat it again. Now I scan everything before I buy it. Thank you Yuka!!!!! You saved my life!"
5,iluvem2,"Yes yes this app is great! I couldn‚Äôt believe that peanut butter is the same across the board, a peanut butter that I have been purchasing regularly turned out to to be the best choice compared to the less expensive version when looking at the additives! Sounds small but it blew my mind!"
5,Aucrenshaw,Just downloaded the app today. I scanned things in my pantry as well as items while grocery shopping. It‚Äôs comforting to know that I‚Äôm making informed and healthy decisions for myself and my children. It‚Äôs so easy to use and allowed me quickly make decisions while grocery shopping.
5,Brutchick,"Absolutely one of the best apps for detailed content of.. anything that has a barcode!  Very happy with this, I now use it on every shopping trip, and passed it on to several friends. It‚Äôs quick and easy, a great tool to use for my overall health. üíô"
5,78Gal,"I did a deep dive when researching this company. They are 100% honest. Meaning they aren‚Äôt being paired off by any company, to sway their results. It‚Äôs really changed they way I shop for food, beauty and personal care products. So many things that I thought were safe or healthy based on the packaging - are not."
5,Norvanna,Now this app easily arms us with the right info to make the right decisions. My garbage bags are overflowing this morning with products I thought were good and safe and turns out they were anything but! Sad to be throwing so much out but glad to be now aware!
5,the_loves_,"I am pretty careful about items I buy to eat and apply to my body.  This app helps me find better options and weed out what I don‚Äôt want or need.  When I first heard about it, I found myself scanning everything in my house.  Now in the stores I scan before any purchases.  Thanks Yuka!"
5,Cattycatcat123,I thought I was making healthy choices but once I scanned my products I realized there was a lot of bad things with harmful chemicals that I was eating. I loveee that the app gives you a healthier recommendation. Now I can actually eat healthier! Alsoo it gives really great information on the additives and why they are harmful. Love that.
5,fam of four 1234,"This app is amazing and makes sifting through the vast amount of options we have to pick one that‚Äôs better. I love the details on why certain things are not recommended and translation on what the additives are. Whoever made this app, thank you thank you thank you!"
5,PstEb,The is a pollution in the food industry nowadays and being able to know if what I consume is good for me or not is of utmost importance. I love how they are unbiased in their product rating. I also love that I can include a product that‚Äôs not rated by following the steps and taking pictures of the product and it‚Äôs nutrition facts.
5,coachchilly,"BEST app I‚Äôve ever used and recommend to EVERYONE I know.  It will change your life!  There are literally thousands of products out there that are so bad for us and I had no idea.  Thank you, Yuka, for actually caring about people‚Äôs health.  I love the recommendations/alternatives that you give.  So helpful and a game changer!"
5,"72$&""@!","I l‚ù§Ô∏ève this app. I think people might get the impression I‚Äôm nuts, scanning everything in the store, but, idc. I feel like I make much healthier choices since I learned about Yuka. It‚Äôs a game changer, especially since waking up about the garbage chemicals in processed foods & products. (Go scan your sunscreen & lotionsüôÉ. Soooo many bad chemicals in it!)"
5,Sargeant!!!,Yuka is a Great app. Almost everyday i just go around my house and scan random stuff because it‚Äôs fun to do. And each time Yuka doesn't know the product i just add it to the app. My family loves to try new things so this app comes in handy to make sure we aren‚Äôt eating anything unsafe.
5,lovers rocker,"My girlfriend recommended me this app , and that‚Äôs the best thing she did , because thanks to this app , I‚Äôm done buying bad stuff for my health. Now every time I go do groceries, I use the app to guide me in what products I should use and which one I should reject, thank you guys for such of thoughtful app. Highly recommended!"
5,chalynda,"Not only is the app amazing and is helping me so much in my weight loss journey, but I‚Äôm also loving the customer service. Because when I message them that a product information is wrong They are so quick to message back and fix it. It‚Äôs amazing. I love this app so much."
5,cycybnik,"I just want to give a big shout out to the creators of this app. I literally tell people in the stores as they are picking up products off of the shelf. Hey, do you know about this app called Yuka? No let me scan this item for you to see if there's any harmful ingredients. If I could be spreading awareness, it is through this app."
1,WardBgirl,"I loved the app, found it useful and very helpful. I liked it so much I purchased a premium subscription. After 2 months the app didn‚Äôt recognize that I was a premium subscriber. I have tried on numerous occasions to contact someone at Yuka but I have received no response, not even an acknowledgment that they received my messages. My advice is to stick to the basic subscription which is free and hope you never have to contact customer service because there isn‚Äôt any."
5,TrickieTreat,"This app has honestly changed my life. It is the single best tool in my toolbox for weeding out hazardous foods/products. It‚Äôs still important to read labels (for example, Yuka doesn‚Äôt flag natural flavors as potentially hazardous; another example is high fructose corn syrup isn‚Äôt a hazardous additive, but I still want to avoid consuming it)."
5,ldsmompjh,"My daughter introduced me to this app. I‚Äôve been struggling with health issues, and this app has helped me so much to identify ingredients that are not good. Plus recommend products that are better!!!! I have introduced it to four friends who are ‚Äúscanners‚Äù too.  It has helped me make better choices! Love this app!!!"
1,shr3kisloveshr3kislife,"I checked multiple items the ones that cleared my skin  got bad reviews but when I checked something that literally made my skin have a dry itchy painful rash on my face and  It got a good review?! All this app is used for is to fear monger, this app just makes the reviews better on expensive more larger brands better  even though their worse because their probably paid to make it seem better. Also they go based off opinion apparently which really isn‚Äôt a very reliable source."
5,Makzum,Finally a app to dumb down the ingredients for me. I now feel I have way more knowledge of what I‚Äôve been putting in my body unintentionally. Absolutely love that effects of some of the additives are included. I‚Äôve got my entire family on this app. Definitely recommend
5,SMWM99,This app is the best. I spent a good hour going around my house throwing out everything that was bad! Then another hour at Walmart scanning everything I could!! So easy to use and read. This is the best app if you care about what you are putting into your body. Thank you for creating this!!!
5,chrispytinita,"This app is amazing! I don‚Äôt really know where to start with researching ingredients and figuring out if items are good, bad, or acceptable. It seems very overwhelming! Yuka does that for me‚Ä¶ and more!! I love how specific it is on each item AND it even offers recommendations ?! Truly has changed my grocery shopping game üôåüèºüôåüèº"
5,ir0nhid3,It‚Äôs so easy to scan items and know right away if it contains ingredients that might not be good for you.  So many processed foods I used to buy that I thought were ok I e found out contain harmful chemicals that I don‚Äôt want to feed my family.  I highly recommend this app to anyone who shops for food.
5,missssah,I‚Äôm glad I found this app! It‚Äôs very informative by letting you know what harmful ingredients are in your food and beauty products. I especially like the recommendations it gives for products that scored bad. Totally recommend this app if you are looking to avoid harmful ingredients in your food and beauty products.
3,Franieboo,At first I loved it. Better than think dirty. I wished I researched more before paying to subscribe. How can various products ‚Ä¶ for instance the beyond burger get a good review and then the same product multiple times be poor? Or Hellman‚Äôs vegan mayonnaise giving a recommendation replacement for follow your heart veganaise yet when you scan veganaise it gets a poor? Perplexing and annoying when you have limited food choices.
5,BrocheBagley,This app is so useful it‚Äôs a must have. I feel so comfortable going to the grocery store knowing I‚Äôll get in and out fast using this app. Me choosing to eat healthier I had been challenging but this app has made it so much easier. Thank you!! I greatly appreciate this app!
2,Felton User,"This app has some positive things but misses the mark on several counts. However, the main drawback is it does not seem to address the most important issue of GMO‚Äôs in food. Since they are so pervasive in our food supply and so damaging to humans, other life forms and the environment, this issue needs to be addressed. Another missed opportunity is to not rate the glyphosate levels in foods. There are several other very important issues that are simply not considered by this app."
2,Abisgr8,Although the app can get the information correctly by scan - it cannot judge the context in which the food is being used to make a judgement of whether it is good or bad. For example if I am using a specific protein bar as recovery and/or meal substitute then ‚Äútoo many calories‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh ft content‚Äù does not apply in that case but if I use it as a snack then it does. Prompt a question for context or have multiple scores for different uses.
4,aaaaqqqisfnblmgrsmdr√º,"While Yuka is generally a helpful app, it tends to rate many high-protein products poorly, which doesn‚Äôt make much sense, especially for people focused on health and fitness who require higher protein intake. Many users looking to support an active lifestyle may feel that this approach doesn‚Äôt fully align with their nutritional needs."
4,Snowens02,"I really like this app. However, it would be great to be able to add in the additives I am sensitive to instead of having to look back through my list. I would love to receive an indicator of my personal conflicting  E#. If there is a way to do so I would love to know! Otherwise I am excited to utilize this resource on my new food journey."
4,Cazcaswell,"I love that this app lets you scan current things you have around the house or even if you scan it at the grocery store, but I wish that you were able to search for the product and see it‚Äôs score/recommendations without having to scan it."
3,Lindsey Lou who üçæ,"I love so many things about this app. I‚Äôm happy there is a quick reference for Ingredients. However, I wish there was a way to look for products without certain ingredients. For example, Yuka deems talc and fragrance (parfume) safe, but these are ingredients I don‚Äôt want in my products. But there‚Äôs no way to exclude recommendations with these products. Mind you, I pay for the app. So I wish there was more customization"
5,Chums*,"I thought I was really healthy I‚Äôm not bad, I also did a few of a friends food‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs worse than mine‚Ä¶ I will 100% make changes I have plenty of room for that‚Ä¶ cosmetics is my Job daily‚Ä¶ huge surprise for me‚Ä¶ I will be researching today for new alternatives.. Thank you for this App.."
5,2MuchLove4Cats,I can‚Äôt go shopping without Yuka. I spend hours in stores scanning everything I would try. This app has saved me so much money that I would‚Äôve spent on trying products I wouldn‚Äôt have liked. I‚Äôve been feeling better since I cleaned up my products thanks to Yuka ü•∞
4,jkelly124,"First off this app is amazing, I didn‚Äôt even realize some of the food i was eating was bad. However I would like to see seed oils added as hazardous as they are linked to diseases and problems. Seed oils such as canola oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oils were meant to be machine lubricants meaning that they should be ranked as hazardous. However I throughly enjoy this site!"
5,KMNC100,This is the first app I‚Äôve ever subscribed to in all the years I‚Äôve been using apps. It‚Äôs absolutely a necessity to find out what‚Äôs really in the products we use everyday. I love that this offers replacement suggestions. I‚Äôm recommending this to so many people!
5,Jz.zumba,"This app is perfect for my family and our lifestyle. I thought I was buying healthy products and food because of the ‚Äúall natural‚Äù labels, but this app has taught me so much more. I‚Äôve shared it with several friends and family members, and we‚Äôre all addicted! So happy it was recommended to me by my aesthetician!"
1,Youcantfinish,When you enter your email to sign in you can‚Äôt change the email when you enter the password. I dunno how to explain this.  I put my email in‚Ä¶ then I get suggested password because Apple makes strong passwords whcih I don‚Äôt know by head ‚Ä¶ so I have Apple fill it in for me but it changes the email from my email to my name which when I click the email to change it there it won‚Äôt let me I have to go back and then the password put in is lost so now I can never log in again.
5,Cautious eater,"This app is so awesome! I love that it shows me everything about ingredients of the products I consume allowing me to be knowledgeable about what I am eating! If the product is not in the app, it directs me on what to enter to get that information. There are now many products I don‚Äôt care to eat!"
5,campy12,"I knew processed foods and stuff in sunscreen was bad but I had no idea what and why. Yuka app is amazing, I‚Äôve switched out my kids sunscreen, lotion, soap, juice and so many snacks. I also know what is bad and why now. It‚Äôs transparent and easy to use. I recommend it for everyone and love their unique business model."
5,AIpha üêæ,I love this app showed me exactly what was making my skin bumpy definitely recommend. a suggestion to make the app better is allow customers to search up specific ingredients incase the app doesn‚Äôt have the product in question
5,ButterflaLady68,My daughter introduced me to this app last year and I have been using ever since. It is surprising to see food that I thought was good for me is actually bad. I have changed a lot of what I am eating because of this app. I don‚Äôt want all those additives in my body and this is a great tool to help me.
5,Katie8392,This app is so good it has really helped me with finding  good things that would help me and to stop using all the things that are rated bad every time I look for ski men care or shampoo or something like that I‚Äôm always using this app you need to download Yuka if you don‚Äôt trust your items best app ever
5,Our interest,I love searching for healthy products due to high cancer in our family. Only draw back is pay anything membership but you have to pay at least 8.99. I would love to know if I can actually find any products before joining.
1,Chicken_Olive,"Yuka uses sources that aren‚Äôt relevant to what the use of products are. For example they use a study with rats in it but humans aren‚Äôt rats and the ingredient is only bad if it‚Äôs ingested. However I forgot what ingredient it is. It‚Äôs only a convenient app if the sources are being used in the correct way. The ingredient cyclopentasiloxane is seen as bad in sunscreen aerosols and hair styling aerosols but the SCCS deems it as fine in certain products due to the concentration. Even if it is fine in a product, Yuka reviews it as bad due to it being bad in some cases."
5,"Happy Gal, Lo",I have been using this app for about a year now and it has changed the way that I make decisions about products. I feel like I have the tools I need to buy the healthiest products and food for my family and I. HIGHLY recommend!
2,Rosie20098,I just downloaded this app and the fact you have to PAY to be able to search for food is ridiculous. Otherwise you have to physically have the product and be able to scan it. So incredibly inconvenient and unhelpful if you want to compare foods without having them immediately available. It seems like such a basic function to put behind a pay wall
5,JRSMTN,"Without a doubt, the best app I have downloaded in years. I use several times a day. I have recommended to all my friends and family. It takes the guess work out of trying to eat healthy. I love the fact that it makes recommendations of healthier options."
5,√ëongui,This is a great app and has been very helpful in guiding us to be able to lead a healthier lifestyle.  I submitted feedback on an item that seemed to have an error and I received a quick response.  The issue was fixed immediately.  Greatly recommend!! üëçüèº
5,divinelyre,"I have been obsessed with this app since I started using it. I mainly use it for the beauty and cosmetic side, but it is so informative and it tells you what products are good and bad based on their ingredient list. I love how easy it is to use and scan things. Definitely recommend"
5,Grace Berry Games,"The people hating on this are so stupid. It‚Äôs such an amazing app with great features, I usually use it to check skincare products before I buy them, but sometimes I use it to scan food to see if it‚Äôs worth buying. Both work great!"
5,bakerpt,"The first 2 weeks of using this app, we have spent 2x the amount of time in the store‚Ä¶scanning everything. I mean everything. We‚Äôve changed our buying habits tremendously. We now feel really good about our food choices. Thank you so much."
5,Rookie123!,"Every consumer should use this when they shop.  It‚Äôs shocking to see how toxic so many product are.  Thanks to this app I now choose much healthier and more environmentally friendly products.  If you very e used the is app, industry would be forced to do better."
3,Benya05,I can‚Äôt log in with iCloud+ for whatever reason and so I‚Äôve lost access to all of my data. Very frustrating and inconvenient. I got a new phone and on my older iPhone it‚Äôs still working.  I‚Äôve been using Yuka for years and have used it internationally to make decisions about my food intake and for what it is I love it. Please fix this problem.
5,HonkyTonk93,"Went from 5 years of trying to get pregnant to getting pregnant after using this app and being more picky. Use to think Whole Foods and Trader Joe‚Äôs were so healthy, now we know it‚Äôs not where but what you buy‚Ä¶thank you for making this!"
5,Rose Bud !üåπ,"This App is perfection ‚Ä¶ I ALWAYS but ALWAYS use this app before buying certain products, the skincare specialist that I visit for treatments (had not heard about this App) &  couldn‚Äôt believe the impressive information that it was showing & she has now downloaded it ‚Ä¶ thank you Yuka !!!"
5,Sp00kyReviewJam!!,It‚Äôs a super great app I love using it only the next day when I clicked to scan my food perfect my camera screen wouldn‚Äôt load? It‚Äôs just pure black I delete and redownloaded the app to have the camera working but still no results! Please fix this I need this app!! It‚Äôs very helpful!!
5,visual accountability,This app is absolutely amazing!! I recently decided to try a plant based diet and using Yuka has been incredibly helpful. Being able to scan products and having the vegan/vegetarian/lactose option saves a lot of hassle. Next step is beauty products!!!
5,MamaBrianne,"Since using this app, I only buy things that fall in the excellent category. I‚Äôm so grateful to know what I‚Äôm buying my family. I scan everything before putting it in the cart! I‚Äôve even helped strangers at the store with it! Thank y‚Äôall for creating this app!!"
5,Dez8,Thank you to the founders for creating this app! The ease of use and breakdown of ingredients is exceptional. I‚Äôm starting a new health journey and this is such a great app to guide me to make better choices. I would recommend to everyone! Be more conscious about what you‚Äôre putting on and inside your body.
5,Sherry from Indiana,"I use this app daily! I love that it offers recommendations for safer alternatives. I have a goal of writing one food or beauty company a week to express my concern and encourage them to change their products. My goal is to quit buying anything with a poor or bad rating, primarily focused on the dangerous and ingredients. Thanks Yuka!!"
5,bjgfvhj,"I absolutely love this app! I tell everybody everybody about it. It has truly changed my life for the better, giving me the knowledge to stay away from toxic ingredients. The only thing I would change is expanding to household products and possibly workout supplements."
3,huhwhut_,"I love this app in theory but real life is something else entirely. I understand that it‚Äôs only to be used for food, drink and cosmetics but the rigid structure of adding an unknown item is a bit silly. I tried adding a kombucha tea supplement (powder) that you add to water, but the options were juice, soda, hot drinks, etc. more variety of options would be helpful, as properly categorizing an item is an important part of the whole gist."
5,AK C Dub,Hands-down this is the most valuable app on my phone. A big thank you to it‚Äôs developers and I extend my congratulations to all 12 for being part of something that‚Äôs making our world a better place. I share your app often. Thank you!
5,CCrider04,Each time I use this I am more impressed.  Has made me change what I eat more than once and the alternatives offered have been good.  Finally I said I just have to support this app and yesterday I became a premium member.  Thank you to the developers who made this available!
5,N√∏tHum√°n,I love this app with a passion. If your craving a healthier lifestyle this is game changing app that makes it easy to track the ingredient's whether it‚Äôs cosmetics or food and it‚Äôs also beneficial to unknown products because the more you put in the more everyone cane benefit from this app 10/10
5,Jae600,This is our family‚Äôs new favorite app!  It is so helpful and such a quick and easy resource to do what we can to buy safe products. As a mom it has been an important tool to guide my purchases. What a brilliant and meaningful impact this is making!! Thank you!!!!
5,Genealogy Genius,"In these times we live in wondering what is being put into our food and body products, the YUKA app is the aid you need on your phone while shopping to scan the products you are buying. It breaks down ingredients and lets you know what products are Bad, Poor, Good etc."
4,GrimTheJugger,"This app is absolutely amazing in every way and will change the rating to 5 stars if they ever add the tracking of seed oils in the food as well, it would be very beneficial to see seed oils factored into the products overall health score and alert you as to whether or not the product contains any."
5,cocoGete,"Love this app. Not only can it tell you that the product you are going to buy or is consuming is good and it explains why, but it also gives you recommendations for the same product but better quality!!!"
5,The Realtor Shabazz,"This app has been an integral part of my desire to have a healthier lifestyle . The quality of your life is proportional to the choices that we make and this app helps me to make better choices . Now , whenever I am choosing what to eat , I scan the item prior to purchasing. Great job !"
4,nikGTX,I recently started using this app and I like it a lot! I use it mainly just to see what ingredients are in some of the products I use and find a healthier alternative. I recommend trying it out just to have a little better idea on other options if you want to live a cleaner lifestyle!
4,„Åü„Åï„ÅØ„Åü„ÇÑ„Åæ„Åï„Åæ„ÅØ„Åü„Çâ„Åæ„Çâ„Åæ„ÅØ,The app gives you all the ingredients for most cosmetics products with a range from how bad and good they are. While using the app be careful to look at what they call bad because some of the things aren‚Äôt bad. The ingredients all have descriptions by them so you can decide if they are as bad for your skincare needs as you think.
5,annbns,"So I use this app mostly all the time on my phone, whenever I‚Äôm buying anything. I really do love that it tells you the ingredients in a product I trust products on this app that are 41+ and up because they honestly end up being SO GOOD! Really recommend this app anytime going shopping 100%!"
5,Shimaphoto,This has been such a wonderful aid to exploring new products!  I find the information accurate and useful when looking at unfamiliar brands and products.  I have been surprised to find brands I avoided for years have options that fall into the green on Yuka!
5,purplehurl$$,"I can view my history easily for reference , scanning is quick and easy, it offers better options if what I‚Äôm inquiring about has a bad rating. Super convenient to get the pertinent info I want. I use it DAILY."
5,JleeS3,It is so sad the choices we are given and the chemicals that are allowed in our food and hair/skin products. This app has opened my eyes and has helped me make better decisions for myself and my family.
5,juliettemayer,"I used Yuka to replace all my skincare products, and my skin has improved SO much. I love that it gives you the actual ingredients that are harmful and gives recommendations. I don‚Äôt have premium but that doesn‚Äôt make the experience of this app any worse!"
5,GodlySis,"My niece introduced me to this app. She just became a mommy and it has helped her tremendously when selecting food and hygiene items for the baby. Since I started using I‚Äôve been sharing it with my family and friends. I like to make well informed decisions and selections, and YUKA helps me do just that."
5,J'Knee,I am a label reader from way back and I love how quick I can just scan a label and know if it's worth buying the item. I live in Mexico and most of my labels are in Spanish though so it doesn't work on everything -  just products imported from the US.
5,JJamean,If you‚Äôre trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle you need this. I hated grocery shopping until I found Yuka (saw it on TikTok) ‚Äî it has made such a difference in helping me make decisions geared toward my personal health journey. I can scan just about ANYTHING and it explains why it‚Äôs good or bad - you can‚Äôt beat it.
4,amanda fundiker,It makes it easier to have a clean diet knowing all that crap company wont tell us their products have   However I think they should add makeup products to the app because recently I realized how much money i had expended trying makeup that wont make me breakout and i wish the app had that option would be so helpful
5,Crossword noob,"This app is truly awesome if you‚Äôre extremely conscious and concern about the food you put in your body. This app is so easy to use, fast, and simple to understand why something is bad for your health. Can‚Äôt recommend this enough!"
5,azpines,Highly recommended!  This app is simple and easy.  I‚Äôve been able to make better choices on my diet and have found some supposedly healthy items are not as healthy as I thought. Great alternatives to other foods are also provided.  Give it a try!
5,Shru117,"I‚Äôm pretty conscious about the food I buy but after a quick scan of things in the house I realized I‚Äôve been using some not so great cosmetics! Sad an app like this needs to exist to begin with, but I‚Äôm glad it does. I‚Äôll be using it to make better purchases in the future!"
5,hewh0shalln0tbenamed,This app has changed the products and food that my family buys. We‚Äôve also learned a lot about which harmful ingredients to avoid. Premium is worth it because it‚Äôs only $9 for the whole year! Thank you for making this app.
5,Jaclyn_rawr,"Not only does it rate foods and cosmetic products right away, but it can give you better/healthier recommendations for each item you scan! I am currently adding to my favorites category for new and healthier grocery items :)"
5,CATEASE,"A friend recommended this app to me and I can‚Äôt say enough about how much time and stress it‚Äôs taken off of me. We are changing diets due to my son‚Äôs medical diagnosis and it‚Äôs been so hard trying to read every single label, deciphering what‚Äôs healthy or not. This app does all of that and more!"
5,KDPG12,"Incredible how contaminated our food is! There are a lot of food products that have been removed from our family grocery list. Also, we love the option to send an email and X post about the removal of bad additives from our food."
5,Evie Jules,"This APP is a must have when grocery shopping at ‚Äúany store‚Äù .  I completed a deep dive on my pantry, refrigerator and freezer.  If you‚Äôre serious about your health, you need to get this app. I‚Äôve already shared it multiple times.  It‚Äôs a real game changer !!!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !!!!  The founders journey and motivation for creating this APP is also really awesome . ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,thisisnotfunorsafe,I tried to enter a product and all its ingredients but the app wouldn‚Äôt let me enter the ingredients at all. When I tried to send mail to contact someone for questions there was no English version of the app to contact.  I took the time to type out all the information and make sure everything was correct and it was a complete waste of time.  I am seriously second guessing the integrity of this app and don‚Äôt trust it after this experience.
5,Dino Del Toro,"Since I started to use this app my eating habits and food selection has change dramatically. I have recommended this app to friends, family and even other shoppers. Julie and team, keep up the good work an continue to make the app better. Dino ID."
5,Cvltmxnd,Not sure how they‚Äôre making money but I‚Äôm sure affiliate links would help. It would be nice if I could click on an alternative and buy it. Thank you for this app. I will be throwing out all of my bad products and replace them with good ones. Thank you.
5,Happy and not fat,"Discovered this app through a girlfriend  Whst a game changer it has been for my family  It‚Äôs such a leave of mind to make healthier choices . The number of chemicals in our food is disgusting. So nice this app helps me make better choices before they make it home  It‚Äôs so easy I scan everything now . I have shared this app with girlfriends and family . Really appreciate your teams hard work and dedication , you guys do all the research  üßê for me all I have to is scan  item  See immediately if it‚Äôs a clean food or a better for me cosmetic Thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,Flower petals 123,Yuka is all you need to eat better and stay healthy for the rest of your journey. You think you are eating good? Use this app on the premium level and you'll really see the truth in what you are eating. It's time for a major change for YOU! You'll use this one.
4,Hmphoksure,This app is really a wonderful app. It definitely helps me try out different and even more so better products. This app would be even more amazing if it would work with baby formulas. Would love to see the options it would recommend & what the ingredients actually are. Please consider this.
5,JJG likes apps,I hope that more people pick up this app so they can realize the dangerous and toxic materials put out by our food industry.  No one has really challenged the food industry on why they‚Äôre putting out such bad and dangerous toxins in today‚Äôs food
5,chubbykoalaz,It‚Äôs not often when I find a app and I have nothing to criticize. I found out why I been getting sick recently and would of never guessed it was the foods I was eating! Your making my life so much easier and easier to get healthy so thank u for the app!
5,PaulitaKayA,"I joined Yuka over two years ago and am still amazed how useful, informative, educational, downright 5 stars this app is. I recommend it multiple times per week to total strangers while shopping. Thank you,  thank you, thank you Yuka!!  Please never leave me. üòç"
5,PinkKarma77777,"So far I love it,I scanned 3 products that had ‚Äúhealthy meal‚Äù on the pkg, I‚Äôm shocked how bad it was rated. Guessing I‚Äôll be checking everything from now on before I put it in my cart, it would be nice if I could scan my vit. Supplement too , wish I found this app sooner. Great job developers."
5,@brandallmerch,I‚Äôm not a light weight guy and I have bad eating habits. I work so many hours it‚Äôs hard to get to the gym. I try to eat well and that last a few days at a time. This app is helping me to still eat but I can eat a better option of what I‚Äôm in the mood for.
5,My nickname was taken !,Super good at telling you what‚Äôs in your food and explains why each ingredient is bad for you and what it damages in your body. App runs fantastic and I‚Äôve been addicted to scanning all of my items at home been using it for a solid month now
5,Dawson Harm,I‚Äôve downloaded this app to be more conscious on what I consume and since then my family has felt way better physically and mentally. I HIGHLY recommend this app and have recommended it to all of my friends I am amazed by how clueless I was before this app.
5,Jsh628bdk,"This app is already changing the way my body feels. I‚Äôm more aware of what I put in my body, and love that it gives safe alternatives to the questionable products I‚Äôve bought recently. It is making me a little manic on how many items I‚Äôm scanning though."
5,Crudezx2,"I started using the Yuka app to try and better myself, after a month of eating good and excellent ratings I have lost 27 pounds, my hairs not falling out, lost a belt loop, skin is better, mind clearer, better sleep, and my resting heart rate went from 85 to 63. After this, I can NOT go back to eating anything polluted."
5,Jesussaves<3,"I would say this app is absolutely life-changing. After losing my grandmother to cancer a few years ago, I became hyper aware of harmful additives in food. Yuka makes it so simple and easy to ensure you are eating safe foods. The app is very fast and works without glitches. Truly a game changer! Thank you."
5,Veeeegan95,"Amazing app! I have only one suggestion! To have a V if the ingredient (even the good ones!) is vegan! I‚Äôm vegan and that would help me out so much! I just threw away so many awful products I had and I am so thankful for this app. Within 24 hours of use, I splurged and bought the full version."
4,Cleckner98,I love this app so far and I enjoy that it gives suggestions of what to use instead of the bad product. I would like to see suggestions as well when scanning a good product to have similar choices to choose from. Haven‚Äôt bought anything yet that‚Äôs recommended but I‚Äôm excited to start!
5,Nick Schooley,"This app actually works, I scan the barcode of a food product and I can see the additives and chemicals (along with calories, sugar and other things) in the food and a little description on how they effect the body."
2,dernhelm1,You will not have full access to the app unless you invite a friend. I would not recommend this app unless I could use it and verify it is a good app which I cannot do due to limited access. Secondly assuming everyone has friends much less assuming those friends all have smart phones is wrong. I would rather pay a dollar to see if this is a descent app than force it on someone.
5,Adventurous55,"I like the details too. If an item turns out to be a 'poor' selection, I get to have alternative choices on the screen and I like that very much. Saves a lot of time trying to figure it out for myself."
5,Doogenheimersmith,"This app is an absolute life changer if you‚Äôre interested in knowing about the chemicals we put on and in our bodies. It gives thorough, easy to ready info and is very user friendly and straightforward. Highly highly highly recommend!!"
5,Kay Kintigh,My son and daughter-in-law introduced my husband and I to the app. We thought we were eating healthy foods and surprise we weren‚Äôt. The app is so simple and easy to use and I appreciate knowing why something doesn‚Äôt rate well.  I would love to see a similar app for pet food/treats.
5,dhjtd5,and I want to tell you hi good morning what's up bro how you doing what are you doing today I got Krispy Kreme doughnuts and it said it was healthy and today I got a chocolate syrup and it said it's Kelsey today I got a chocolate and he said it's Kelsey hi good morning what's up bro
1,mina vega,"I used the free version and it worked great. I upgraded to premium and the app now is practically unusable. I turn it on and when it stays on it goes into downloading offline mode and stops working, turn‚Äôs itself off. It‚Äôs a mess.  I‚Äôm going to remove it and download it again. If it still doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going to cancel the premium membership and just go back to using the free version. I‚Äôm disappointed because I really would like to support this app."
4,Foodie GenX‚Äôr,"I love this app.  It is very helpful in making better, healthier choices in food and products.   However, it would be even better if it would include when a food contains bioengineered ingredients or bug ingredients like acheta powder.  I would give it 5 stars if those 2 things were included.  Keep up the good work!"
5,bitty life,I use this for mostly important things but when im bored in my kitchen i get curious so i start scanning. Most of the stuff in my kitchen IS HORRIBLE. but ill still eat it. And i wish i could interact with the creators on insta but i didnt know that they spoke a different language. Love Yuka!
5,K$wizzle!,This app is the bee‚Äôs knees! I love that it tells you the quality of the product as well as what‚Äôs in them! It‚Äôs an eye opener for sure seeing all of your favorite products loaded with all kinds of ingredients you can‚Äôt pronounce. This is by far my most favorite app to use!
5,Smurfyxxx,My mom shared with me this incredible app and it has dramatically changed our lives!! Such a great app to help us better our lives and eating habits.  I still can‚Äôt believe the items I thought were healthy and they were terrible.  Thank you guys so much!! Dan and Evelyn
5,zeitgeist,"Yuka is a great little app that offers you new insights into the foods you eat and the products you use on your body like cosmetics, lotions, soaps, etc. A simple but effective interface and clean uncluttered design make using the app a joy to use. Highly recommended."
5,Fattydrop,I would just like to say that this is one of my favorite apps. I hope it keeps getting stronger and stronger with products. I would say I‚Äôve had over 100 people that I had download this app that absolutely love it. keep up the great work and thanks again. Jason
5,Curry.lover,This app is wonderful . Helps you make wiser and healthier choices.  If you have kids it‚Äôs even better because we all want to feed our children healthy foods and know that the products they consume or use on a daily basis are made with good and safe ingredients.
5,takenfar,If you follow this app it will help you lose weight it has been proven with numerous people that have downloaded the app and followed it green means go red no try it you won‚Äôt regret it hyperactivity has decreased majorly with several people‚Äòs kids that we know even ours  proven facts üôè‚ù§Ô∏è!!!!!
5,Conveince is Best,I honestly didn‚Äôt know all the things that aren‚Äôt good for me in my house!!! When you first download you start scanning almost anything you can find! I also like they give recommendations for the items with a bad score. I am recommending this app for sure!
5,Rpdragoneyerp,I am very amazed on how fast they knew product on the list can be scrutinized with just a picture of the list of ingredients. Contributed my first product today and I was shocked on how fast this website did did the evaluation of the ingredients.
5,Jcjcjulio,I don‚Äôt do reviews much but this app has changed my food habits and pointed me towards the right products. I highly recommend for everyone. It provides alternatives that would improve your health all around. Thank you Yuka.
3,Popeye 0511,"I just scanned an ‚ÄúUnreal‚Äù brand candy and it was rated ‚Äúpoor‚Äù by the app because of its fat/calorie/sugar content. Great, happy to have the information. The app then recommended a Snickers candy bar as an alternative. The Snickers product had more fat, calories and sugar than the Unreal, plus it was made with corn syrup instead of real sugar. I like the idea of the app, but the recommendations seem off."
5,Vader04!,Extremely happy with this app!! Easy to navigate and extremely helpful when looking for healthier alternatives at the grocery store.  Unfortunately the USA is extremely liberal with food processing  regulations/restrictions.  The YUKA app helps me make healthier choices with dietary choices and beauty products.
2,Andrew West1,"The first item I scanned was shelled pumpkin seeds and it gave it a super low score of around 38 if I remember correctly. I thought it was quite dramatic but I gave the app the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe it‚Äôs the peanut oil that‚Äôs making the score low‚Ä¶ No, it got scored in the 30s because of high fat and high calories‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. With this logic nuts are terrible for you! And so is every other thing that‚Äôs high fat and high calorie. Do better."
5,Couple #2,"I‚Äôm enjoying using Yuka app to know what‚Äôs in my products.  I feel I have a handle now  on my health. What‚Äôs really nice , is it scans not just food but drinks & cosmetic products as well.  Eventually, I‚Äôm hoping it will be able to do nutritional facts on some of my health products. Thank you!"
1,a girl who gives reviews,Many of the things that are ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor‚Äù are things i have been recommended by literal Dermatologists‚Ä¶ most of the expensive products are at the top and i get the dupe for them again (told by a Dermatologist) bc I don‚Äôt have the money for these expensive products and to be completely honest seeing that my products are ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚ÄúPOOR‚Äù (mostly poor) makes me feel worthless.. maybe use some better words to describe the product in a negative way?
5,MizzJone,This app is great. Helps you stay aware of what you‚Äôre putting in your body. It also gives you alternatives to the things you really should avoid. It makes my shopping a lot easier. I‚Äôm now aware of what I‚Äôm putting in my temple.
5,Kaylen98765,"Absolutely love this app. So clean and easy to use. I love that it tells you WHY something isn‚Äôt safe and suggests alternative clean products, that‚Äôs the most helpful. I really hope it‚Äôs in their business plan to add household products as well."
5,UzRhPy,This app is amazing. It enables people to make better decisions for their health by giving them the knowledge to do so. This saves lives and quality of lives. The fact that you can contribute information is a fantastic and empowering bonus. So thankful for this app!
4,"Yuka is amazing! But..,","Yuka has made my life healthier, but I see for some items in larges quantity will have different ratings then the same item in a different quantity, for example Impossible Pattie‚Äôs had a 75 rating in a quantity of 10, but a rating of 49 in a smaller quantity even though they were the same product."
5,Rach !,"This will literally change the what you put in and on your body. Half of the ingredients are literally cancerous, cause infertility, thyroid issues, and so much more. Then it gives you an alternative product to put on your skin or eat. It is an amazing app."
5,aalbano1,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app! Besides being health conscience regularly, I am now pregnant and very concerned about what I am eating. Yuka makes it easy to watch what I am putting in my body and I feel confident using it. I highly recommend."
5,hdjdkfndjis,This app tells me what I should know about these products! I witsh companies cared more about what they were putting into their products but thanks to this app I don‚Äôt have to worry as much! I now have confidence that I‚Äôm spending money on quality products
5,srk3000,I love using this app. I use this in every day basis. From scanning cosmetics before buying and also the food items that I want to buy thank you very much for creating this app and giving it to the general public.
5,"Cfdtylv,uthdy",Thank you for this app. It‚Äôs been a hit within my circle of friends and family.  I hope you‚Äôll consider this feature request: a quick access to the scanner via a lock-screen widget.
5,Doinglife,A friend recommended this app. It has changed what we eat. The app is so easy and extremely useful! Looking forward to a much healthier lifestyle. Finding alternatives is easy with the suggestions. I cannot tell you how much we enjoy this app.
5,URFAVADDIEü´∂üèª,"first if i wanna say how much this app has helped me develop a new and improved skincare routine!!! secondly this app was created to help us know what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs bad for weather it‚Äôs food,makeup,skincare whatever it is. and i love how it shows the ingredients of what is in the product and what is being used. i love this app!!!"
1,Ramboserbian,"Was very helpful but then I noticed that they update things as they go, example: Celsius was ranked highly on Yuka, around 74/75 and didn‚Äôt had anything bad or harmful for someone who‚Äôs working out or looking some alternative for other energy drinks, one day just changed to 33 or so which is the same rate as Red Bull. Not just that, they also updated all my history search, so they probably don‚Äôt get sued by bunch of people for false information etc.   Very very disappointing experience."
2,TraciiS,I paid a $14 donation for the app but I still have to invite a friend in order to be able to see the lists of top products? It‚Äôs disappointing especially if you don‚Äôt have friends interested in this sort of app and have no family.  I‚Äôm not spamming everyone I know with this. First 10 minutes using it and already annoyed.
3,Pi 3p14,"Fantastic app for figuring out how toxic products are. This has changed the way I shop. The down sides are that the app is very buggy. Sometimes it sits there spooling for a long time. More concerning: I started getting bombarded with junk email from other entities the moment I downloaded it, so it seems there are issues with security."
5,Grandma Gail W,This is an excellent resource. But it is not perfect. There are items I like that have a lower rating. Always check to see why a product received a lower rating. As someone on a keto-type diet I don‚Äôt always agree with their ratings.
4,Lincoln123321123321,"Really excited about this app and all of the information it provides. As soon as I downloaded it I think I scanned everything in my kitchen! My only complaint is that is doesn‚Äôt include a lot of harmful additives such as natural & artificial flavors, gums, seed oils such as canola oil, corn syrup, added colors and dyes. I‚Äôd love to see these added as a red flag for products."
5,Rick 123456756,Hopefully they continue to add additional products as this app grows in popularity.  I have recommended to many of my friends and family.   It is super quick and efficient way of figuring out what to eat and what to avoid.
5,GTH2021,Since downloading this app I‚Äôve been on a scanning spree Lol. I‚Äôve recognized so much stuff within my home is terrible. This app gives great details on the reasons why the foods & cosmetic products are bad. I‚Äôm so glad I came in contact with this app. Very helpful & informational. Great job
5,Mika Miami,This has to be the best app. I was scanning my food at Trader Joe‚Äôs and had no idea that some of the organic brands I would usually buy were so unhealthy. I love the fact that it gives you a list of what brands are a better option for you. Bravo to the developers of this app. üôåüèª
5,CreepyKandie,"Before this app I have been constantly riddled with anxiety when shopping for food and toiletries. Because despite the labels with ingredients, I don‚Äôt know the chemicals or what they mean or do. Yuka is amazing for telling me in a way that I understand which products will and won‚Äôt harm me."
2,Mobile Expert.,I give it two because while it does show it something is very bad it does not account for things like keto which are suppose to have high amounts of fat and saturated fat so it basically said all the keto food I had was very bad. It also does not do vitamins which I feel are the most important and other dietary products it states they do not do‚Ä¶would be 5 stars if they did bc that matters most.
5,fun4unme,"I am scanning almost everything, from lotion to packaged food. Almost everything is there. It really is helping me make better decisions especially when I think something is healthy and it reads ‚Äúpoor‚Äù thanks to my student who shared this with me. Cheers."
5,Rockieem,They are the BEST app for scanning products to see the clean-ness. They scale the product out of 100 and explain why based on the products ingredients they have that score.   Biggest plus is that they give UNBIASED recommendations for alternative products based on the INGREDIENTS and not based on marketing/ partnerships.
5,jessicaspear,"I was introduced to this app yesterday and am already hooked.  I appreciate the options that are given, how each item is broken down and color coordinated for low, medium and high risk.  I would (and already have) recommend this app."
5,The larger Little,This app has helped my family make healthier decisions when it comes to foods. Things I never knew were unhealthy have been brought to light. It‚Äôs empowering us to make healthier decisions. I love the healthier recommendations feature!
5,MamaBrennan,"Patiently, my elderly mother moved in with us. She had a stroke! She‚Äôs been here for seven months, has lost 30 pounds and is living and dying by this app and can‚Äôt believe she didn‚Äôt have it sooner our life I never thought she would change her diet habits this app is amazing."
5,Robertute99,"I cannot imagine my life without YUKA now anymore. It helps me choose the best foods and the best cosmetics for my body. I do have an extremely sensitive skin and I am in a hunt of the best products and I couldn‚Äôt do that without YUKA! Thank you so much for your hard work, Dear YUKA! It truly means a world to me."
1,.M.J.2,"This app has so many wrong ingredients of information about a product. I addressed so many products that need to be corrected, but there‚Äôs no response from customer services or whoever the email I got sent to. There are duplicate products with different ratings. If you want to verify the product, go to the actual website of the product and look for its ingredients or full ingredients."
5,Meandames,I love this app. Im always telling ppl about it. I recommend looking at the why food and products are rated low. It will change the way you look at products and what you put in and on your body. Let‚Äôs get healthy.
4,Ndsoul,"I think this is a great app. I would love if it would allow its members to enter specific ingredients that we are intentionally trying to steer clear from, such as allergens, pore cloggers etc. That way the app can single those out in even recommended products. Just a suggestion for the app developers :)"
4,BTRFQPHI,"This would be perfect if calories didn‚Äôt factor into the score.I‚Äôm using this to check the quality of ingredients, not as a diet app.   Including the calories in the score doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because: - I might be eating this as meal (my 260 calorie oatmeal says it has too many calories but it‚Äôs my entire breakfast so‚Ä¶)  - I might not eat the serving size. - 500 calories of clean food without chemicals and additives shouldn‚Äôt get a bad rating for being too caloric when a similar product with more additives scores better just because it‚Äôs less calories."
4,jeffdanger1,Love this app but it seems mine is in French and I don‚Äôt see an English version. Rates almost every food product I have tried it on and even updated ingredients on one item after I took a photo of the ingredient list. Made several healthier choices because of this app. Keep up the great work.
5,Paullyeater,"Absolutely love this app! Not only will it give you a rating on the food item you scan, but it also tells you why it has a poor or good rating. It will even give you recommendations for a better/healthier choice!"
5,Rima412,Food packaging and labels can be misleading.  You think you‚Äôre eating something healthy when you‚Äôre not.  This app allows you see truth about the food you buy and provides recommendations for better choices. I‚Äôm glad I found it.
5,HappyUser20220922,"My daughter introduced me to this app on Saturday. By Tuesday I had changed my moisturizer, my shampoo, my sunscreen, and the chocolate snacks and the salty snacks I was eating. This was definitely a life-style changing app to find, and I don‚Äôt think I would have ever believed that I would say that about any app."
5,benis d,Everything abt the app and the people behind it is made with care and u can tell  not a ploy or such i cant thank this app or the developers of it enough overall THE BEST WAY to find healthy clean products for yourself honestly i dreamed of an app like this before and when i learned abt it‚Ä¶ game changer
4,plantbased queen,"Amazing app I upgraded it so I can scan food products as well , one thing I do wish it would read the chemicals in food like it does for the beauty products it only gives you the fats and sodium intake...Will there be any upgrades on that structure soon ?  Great work definitely recommend to everyone üëç"
5,courtney5421,Yallllll I am obsessed with this app. I loved it so much I bought the premium. The fact that is many things I thought were ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù have added risks blows my mind. I scan everything now! It‚Äôs so easy and the alternatives is perfect. Great app 10:10 for sure
5,P3b8ers,"This app is not only informative but fun to use. The fact that it is fast and easy and gives you suggestions is everything. It is user friendly and so easy to use, a child could use it. It‚Äôs a game changer."
5,Happy Life in Progress,Yuka is awesome! Healthier choices can be made quickly. I appreciate the healthier choice suggestions. I was amazed to discover how many foods and products I was using scored so low (like 0 üò¨). I‚Äôm newly retired so it also gives me something to chat about with others. Thank you!
1,uvd!38.,"For some reason the ingredient ‚ÄúFragrance‚Äù is listed as low risk in products despite stating in the description, ‚ÄúThis means that consumers cannot always know exactly which chemical components are present in the fragrances they apply to their skin or inhale.‚Äù You‚Äôre telling me we don‚Äôt know what exactly is in Fragrances so we are just going to trust manufacturers that there is nothing harmful in there? Yikes.   I‚Äôve heard toxicologists state that this is an ingredient to absolutely be avoided is why I am even taking the time."
1,Makes no ≈õense!,"At first the app was great! I was a little dumbfounded by the fact that almost all of the foods i eat are like junk.  And then, one morning, I went to go scan an item. Then a black screen showed that said ACOUNT BLOCKED. And i questioned this, and i had no idea what the heck happened. So i wrote an email and asked what i did, and they said ‚Äúyou typed in wrong information on a product!‚Äù But i didn‚Äôt. But they still didn‚Äôt do anything. So that‚Äôs why you should not get this app. Ever."
4,Candice A,I‚Äôm happy to contribute to this app however the in app photo will not allow for the full range of my camera. Can you add a feature to allow choosing a photo from my camera roll to use to macro feature on the smaller bottles and pots of products? Thanks.
5,Nonya26,Best app to check the ingredients in each of the products we use every day and make a call whether you want to continue to use a product that can make you sick.
5,Unhollykii,I‚Äôve been sticking with it not doing anything that‚Äôs rated lower than 60% and my gut hasn‚Äôt felt happier. Imagine if I did 80% or higher!! what‚Äôs funny is we pay for all these vitamins then we eat bad food. Get the app you‚Äôll be happy.
5,jasminjjjjjjjj,"Could have some updates like remembering search products, adding specific concerns like acne safe or vegan. Having a removable concern like remove zinc from being bad etc. I love the recommendations but wish I could have these other tools!"
5,Forgiven_1,"Overall great app! My daughter recommended to me. I‚Äôm able to find a lot of healthier options. Laundry detergent cannot be found on the app, hopefully in the near future they can add that .  The only negative is the app crashes a lot ‚Ä¶"
4,Runner5kcrazy,"I feel as though seed oils need to be included among the other additives that are listed, as they are very high in poly-saturated fats as well as have some harmful health effects. The current range of additives is great, I just feel as though there is always room for improvements and adding seed oils would be a great addition."
5,ilmmarty,Love love love this app. Makes shopping 100 times easier. You actually know the quality products your getting and what the ingredients really are that they are putting into our stuff. FDA needs to wake up and regulate grocery garbage!!
5,tarabug79,A friend told me about this app. I was just recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic so I‚Äôm slowly learning what I can and cannot have. Reading labels can be a pain but this makes it so easy. I have already recommended it to my family and friends.
5,cnguard,"This is the greatest free app that I have ever used. It‚Äôs so easy to use, and it gives suggestions for healthy alternatives, when a product scores poorly! I have discarded so many products that were really bad and replaced them with healthy alternatives."
2,Mamalinda61,I like the ease of the app and use it often but found that I need to beware and read ALL the labels and not rely on the app for my information.  I have found that my canned beans that have ratings of 90 on Yuka. The app only showed 1 risky additive when the cans showed they actually showed 2 or 3 risky and unhealthy additives.  I was hoping the app would make my life easier and save time. I gave it 2 stars because it is easy to use.
5,#HappyGut,Been scanning everything in my house. Shocked to see how many things I purchased that I thought were good for me but aren‚Äôt.  The fact that it suggests similar but healthier options is fantastic. Thanks for developing
5,klutz ninja,"They say knowledge is power, right? After being lied to by the ""health"" and ""beauty"" industries our whole lives, thank you to Yuka for putting the power back in our hands. I am forever grateful and will continue to share the Yuka app with everyone I can."
5,skip00c17,Everything in our bathroom despite the ‚Äúplant based‚Äù ‚Äúgentle‚Äù and other enticing labeling was poor or bad rating with hazardous or low risk ingredients. Will be using it to scan any future products before buying. U.S. advertisement and labeling really needs to change!
5,Kelli Kolo,"I thought I was eating healthy, making good choices in terms of fruits and vegetables and low-fat foods, but I had no idea that some of the ‚Äúhealthiest‚Äú foods were horrible for me due to additives and preservatives. This app is invaluable and has changed the way I eat!"
5,xHazey1x,"It is extremely important to be ever vigilant of what you‚Äôre putting into your body. So many products have risky and downright dangerous ingredients. This app has made it so easy to see exactly what I‚Äôm buying, I use it every time I go shopping!"
5,Eddica82,With the stress of buying food for your family with all these companies using dangerous additives in our food YUKA is so helpful. I‚Äôve gotten use to scanning food right away and now with ‚Äúcall out the company direct email this is perfect! Thank you!!!
5,TrueOne23,"I‚Äôve had this app since it started, and it just gets better. I like how it clearly explains whats in our food and daily products. It helps us make better choices to stay healthy!"
5,LolaBonny1,What a gift!  This app is going to change lives- my family included!  Thank you for this honest way to really look at what we‚Äôre putting in (& on) our bodies.  Really appreciate the alternate suggestions too!!
4,HALO2093,"A few people in my family scanned the same item, but we all got different ratings. Can someone please explain to me why this is? This app is great, but the different rating thing for the same one item is a little scary to be honest."
5,its me 15123,"A great way to keep track of your way of eating. Not only does it give you the ratings and information on the product, but it also gives you alternatives if the product is not healthy."
5,Danny Z. G,This app has made me make better decisions when it comes to water and energy drinks I used to consume. Thank you so much to the developers for letting me know what I‚Äôm actually ingesting instead of listening to the marketing.
5,Jenny Henley,I am so happy and grateful for this app. You just don‚Äôt know what is in your food anymore especially in the USA. Please do yourself favor and download this app now. Take back your choices on products. Know what‚Äôs going in your body!!! Thank you thank you sooooo much for this app!!!
2,ThisisQuina,Not impressed the EWG has been doing the same thing since the 90s a true legit organization. Yuka is an app that is not really accurate! It‚Äôs better than nothing but do yourself a favor and go to the legit source EWG has a free app and dives into depth. I did a few side by side comparisons between both apps database on specific products and Yuka missed a few things giving consumers wrong information! I want my money back!
5,JM V V,"Seriously, I am so impressed. Super easy to use and incredibly helpful!  If I could give this more than a 5 star rating, I would!  Thank you, thank you Yuka app creators‚Ä¶.you are angels!! Please keep making a difference for all of us and our world‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,suwaysUrfer234,This app is amazing ! I do wish that you could search up products without having to be a member also maybe you could think about having a recommendation section so even if the product you scan is good you can still se more products like it.
4,Somethingthatworks,So I just got the app and upgraded to the pro version. I was hoping I would be able to add specific ingredients that I want to avoid but it seems it doesn‚Äôt have that option. If this could be added in the future it would be a 5/5 for me.
5,Tumblaaa,"I live my life by this app. Whenever I find something that isn‚Äôt good, they give me an explanation as to why it‚Äôs not good and recommend an alternative product!!! Wish I knew about it sooner. Has been helping me ALOT with my weight loss journey !"
5,JCo0728,Whoever had the brilliant idea to create this app is genius! I love being able to scan products to see what the ingredient side effects are. Definitely makes you rethink when purchasing items. Proud to say I am a member now! üòÄ
5,MrKastle,Excellent app to scan to see the right foods to eat. It even gives you recommendations if you scan a ‚Äúbad‚Äù nutrition item. Simple easy to use just need email and make your own password.
5,cheese wacker,This app has helped me so much it‚Äôs very easy to use and i love that about it i love that i can just scan my products and it tells me if it‚Äôs good or not and gives the reasons why below and i love the fact it give recommendations!
4,Siskiy,"It‚Äôs an excellent app and I‚Äôm glad it doesn‚Äôt force you to subscribe to use the basic feature. But I wish it didn‚Äôt count more calories as a negative thing, it‚Äôs pretty silly since the whole point of eating food is to consume calories in order to live. Other than that I like it."
1,BlueBella,"Said Low Sodium chicken broth was poor and recommended baby food instead. Claims Jif peanut butter is better than Justin‚Äôs, recommends heavy cream over macadamia milk, says soy sauce is better than liquid aminos, says NoSalt is worse than Himalayan salt. Useless and totally wrong on almost everything.  This fool app keeps attempting to download itself again after I removed it, restarted my phone many times, deleted it every way I can.   What king of hijacking, data hogging crap is this anyway. Dangerous, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!"
5,KittyKat777000777,"I absolutely love Yuka, it makes me feel  much more educated about the food/cosmetics/etc I put into and onto my body, and I love that it also includes the environmental impacts of certain ingredients!"
5,Tori L F,"I am seriously so thankful for this app, it‚Äôs saved me a lot of money and has informed me of how many harmful ingredients are in the items we reach for the most. God bless the creators and the people who keep this app going!"
5,Raspberryslol,The app is so good but there‚Äôs just so much food that‚Äôs not good for me üò≠ The app makes me feel a little shame for eating these unhealthy foods but the app also helps me look out for there‚Äôs!! Love the app so much I tell my kids and my parents/ mutual friends to download this!!
3,Katieisthebestyoutuber,"I like the app but I thought it could also scan pet products and tell me if it‚Äôs good for my pet so I scanned the shampoo I wash my ferret with and it didn‚Äôt work   they don‚Äôt scan cleaning products either it also says 1 gram of fat is too much fat  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too much fat for what I was scanning or if it‚Äôs a glitch Other than that, I love that app"
5,Tu-am,"We use the Yuka app every time we go shopping at places like the supermarket, Costco, or Walmart. It gives us confidence in choosing healthy food and avoiding harmful products for our family. Yuka has been a valuable source of education in protecting our health."
3,PickyMom123,Have run into the same product listed more than once with a different rating.  Exact same product both bad and excellent.  Still love the app but am double checking anything that says excellent to make sure all ingredients on the actual product are listed on the rating.
5,Mikecony,This app is fantastic I recommend it to everyone it‚Äôs amazing that food that you thought was good for you was no good and food you stayed away from was actually great for you I‚Äôm actually gaining more muscle and still losing fat with this amazing app
5,firedragonnatsu,I used thinkdirty before this and struggled with it because so much useful info was paywalled. Yuka (to my knowledge so far) is open and free information and very easy to use. I‚Äôm able to make quick decisions on good/bad products much easier
5,Pepperkinkade,I love this app so much I had to do a membership to help the cause! Now I can quickly easily choose a product that's best for my health without having to stand there and read every word on the back. Thank you guys for all that you do!
5,Kuya21,"Love this app! Been using it for over a year now, and best of all it‚Äôs free! Being that the team is 100% independent and doesn‚Äôt accept any partnerships, I went ahead and bought a year of premium membership just to help out!"
5,READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Idk where to start, Yuka has helped me lose 22 pounds so far and still going it helps with almost everything I‚Äôve scanned. There support is crazy good they gave me premium for free and I‚Äôm so happy to use it. Thank you so much Yuka."
5,RaeRae51945,I downloaded this app because I have tried to be more conscience about what products I place in and on my body.  I had no idea some of the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù products I use contain such horrible additives!  Here‚Äôs to clean living!
5,Zacharyshay,Please improving anything store add more test any joe trade or Kroger or other stores check anything testing add some missing not have beer or pet food need add good or bad or poor ü§£üòä thank you test your wonderful need improving deep checking thank you
5,Agmoonpie,I have recommended this app to everyone I know. I never realized how bad so many things we bought were for our health!  I will not buy a product without scanning or searching for it first. So grateful for the developers of this great app.
5,laurelisswag,"This app is truly revolutionary. I have gone through my pantry, refrigerator, bathroom, grocery store, cosmetics store and I am constantly shocked and surprised at what I am finding. How would we know this stuff if it weren‚Äôt for apps like this? Thank you!!!!"
4,paquisib,"This app helps me a lot to take decisions about what to food to buy it not.   I just wish that the app could also take into account the different types of oils used in the food, for example a snack made with coconut oil is better than a snack made with vegetable oil which highly inflammatory.  Also I wish that the app could take into account the fiber used in the food, for example a snack that contains inulin is good for the health.   I believe with time this app will get better and better and be good helper for all moms deciding what food to choose for their kids."
5,lilbrithang,It tells you a full description of everything your putting into your body and if it‚Äôs good for you or not. And it will offer alternative products that are similar but healthier!! Worth the download
5,MostDopeVisualss,So far the app is pretty good! Only con is that some foods and items are registered in the app and it doesn‚Äôt show up! But main name brand foods do for the most app! I would recommend this app for someone who is trying to shop healthier!!
5,tea and chips,"I've only used this app for a few days, but I absolutely love it.  Saves time grocery shopping, and it was fun seeing which of my snacks were healthy.  So simple and fast!  This is a keeper and helps us all to make better choices."
5,JMB 27,"A must have on your phone for determining which products to buy and what to avoid.  You get a nice summary of +‚Äôs and -‚Äòs.  You also get feedback on dieting via emails.  No AI person, a real associate.  Sign up for an annual contribution.  Worth supporting a good cause. Thank you Yuka and associates"
5,demo4jc,This app has been an absolute life saver for my family! We have taken so many bad foods out of our grocery list and have learned so much about what these ingredients truly mean.
5,Younger4,"My young adult children introduced this app to me and I truly love it!! I believe food is the first step for a healthy life‚Ä¶AND this app makes searching through the labels obsolete. I truly appreciate this app and recommend it to all my friends, family and neighbors!"
5,AIondraz,I‚Äôve had this app for about 2 to 3 years now and I haven‚Äôt really used it because I kind of forgot about it but yeah I love using this app and it‚Äôs very convenient and I‚Äôm looking forward to any more add-ons that will be part of the app
5,LeslieDana,"This app has helped me properly choose face creams and serums that have helped my suddenly super sensitive skin. I love it and so appreciate the help that dermatologists don‚Äôt seem to understand about products and preservatives, that I‚Äôm convinced are ruining our skin.  Happy girl, Leslie"
5,Thegoffyguy1412,This app is really nice but I‚Äôm confused about stevia and steviol is it different or not. If it‚Äôs a typo well thanks you for my service! LOL Thanks Yuka for being such a great app 4 to 5 stars of because how on track they are with these questions and helping my education about food!!!
5,Facial wellness,"Before I had to look everything up, this makes it easier to know what I‚Äôm taking when I‚Äôm putting on my skin and I can compare it to the books that I use to look things up"
5,bR549too,"Total game changer! If you are concerned about what you put in and on your body ( and, believe me, you should be) this app will change the way you shop‚Ä¶. Get ready to clean out your cabinets and start feeling good again‚Ä¶. Enthusiast FIVE Stars!!!"
2,tibnvds,Arizona fruit punch is scoring as ‚Äúgood‚Äù when it contains high fructose corn syrup as the second ingredient. One week a hair product scored a ‚Äúbad‚Äù 0 for harmful/hazardous additives and scored ‚Äúgreat‚Äù the next week. Now the app doesnt list all the ingredients. It was much better before!! It was a full 5 stars!! Not sure when it changed. It was so helpful before to learn what to look out for and figure out whats important to you. Not anymore. :(
4,Rheadonna,Hi! Suggestion- some people do not consider high calorie or sat fat to be a negative and I know this affects scoring greatly. Would love to see a feature where you can toggle certain ingredients/hazards that you‚Äôve decided are okay for yourself. I eat high fat and protein because I am pregnant and I have PCOS.
5,whusted,I can not begin to explain how much I love this app! it has helped me choose healthier options in food and cosmetics. I love that it lists the ingredients and also tells you what those ingredients do to your body. I recommend this app to everyone!
5,Quinton Heck,"I use this app every time I‚Äôm shopping. Love how it breaks everything down and tells you exactly why an ingredient is bad, and the sources of where the information comes from. Definitely recommend getting this app!"
5,Tawanda888,Thank you. I love being able to scan foods and see what‚Äôs in them without having to try to read a microscopic label which is hard to decipher anyway. This is a great idea. I hope more people will catch on.
5,Onlymahealani,Literally my favorite app!! It has helped me so much to figure out what products I shouldn‚Äôt use and should. I love that it shows recommendations on what products are good for you to buy as well. Its honestly the best. I definitely recommend downloading it.
5,vargas house,My daughter shared this app with me and I was shocked to see so many of the products I was using were not healthy for us. Thank you for providing this info to allow me to make informed decision about what products come into my house.
3,monitorLynne,"This app was recommended to me so I decided to try it. I love the idea behind it, but when I scanned my gluten free products, they got a poor rating and gluten-containing products were recommended instead. Apparently if I pay, I can tell it I can‚Äôt have gluten, but if it‚Äôs not working, why would I pay for the privilege of finding out it‚Äôs not working?"
5,Asdfghjkzbxbdjsnx,This app has really opened my eyes to America‚Äôs FDA regulations. It‚Äôs sickening. I am so glad this app was created to help educate people on the long list of ingredients in our food!! Our grocery bill is higher but so much peace of mind not eating garbage and feeding it to our kids!
5,be the light1111,This app is life altering and so important! It‚Äôs completely changed my life. I‚Äôm so grateful to it‚Äôs creators and everyone who continues to share it and work toward a more informed healthy lifestyle. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a review for an app. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.
5,mslfbreezh,My partner has health issues and is very sensitive to various foods. This app has made it easier to select healthier food and lotions. I love how the app provides healthier options and breaks down why the item scanned is good or not. Highly recommended. Grateful for this app.
2,Hi bye hola addios,"I scanned my skincare products and it said 0/100 for one. I was very confused because it does help me so like what? And I see a recommendation, I went shopping and ended up finding that recommendation and scanned it for fun but it again said 0/100. Overall the app is stressful, inconsistent, and lying to me. Apparently all of my products that work for ME that actually stopped my acne and made me feel great don‚Äôt work for me."
5,rileyjoh18,"This app needs to be on every single phone in the USA and elsewhere. It is my go-to for any food. I use it to check how good or bad my food is for me. Some products need to be updated, but it is seamless and easy for a user to update products!"
5,Ramo Ali,"After downloading this is my favorite application, because I am using it almost all times to scan the food which I am going to buy. Now I know which products are less harmful. Thank you very much!"
5,23 happy!,So many foods imply they are great & healthy! Thanks to Yuka app I am no longer fooled.  I rely on it and always surprised at the toxicity but the healthier alternatives listed below are my go to. I love Yuka! uses the safer Europe health codes plus US ones.  The US is no where near as protective so grateful they use both.
5,gang boi,I love Yuka because I can use it for all my grocery trips and really understand the food that I‚Äôm eating. It has helped me for dieting and weight loss and would highly recommend all people to use Yuka to be more health conscious in their lives.
5,Angyie23,Thanks for changing my eating habits and saving my children from eating hazardous chemicals. We are very grateful for this app. Even my kids scan everything before consuming it. It‚Äôs now a new habit. Thanks for your dedication to saving lives. Love you all!
5,Fast Strong Healthy,Thank you for the amazing app. I am excited that I found this smart app. It saves me a lot of time when I do my grocery shopping specially I care about eating healthy food and I used to spend long time reading the labels.
5,Magicdude13,This app is absolutely sensational. When I walk into a grocery store I have my phone in hand and am armed and ready with YUKA - if you have any concern whatsoever about what food you put in your body then you need and WILL USE Yuka- don‚Äôt leave home without it - it‚Äôs a life saver
5,Pawleysc,I use my app everyday and everywhere! It has been life changing. I have shared this to everyone I know and they also have loved it. Thank you for creating something so helpful for our health and well being.!!
5,Jupean,My son and I have fun learning about  the different products we consume. Thanks to some of the findings we have started to make our own lip balm and skin products as well as change some of out drinks for healthier choices.
5,almatezen,Since I got this app I have been able to buy products that are better which makes me feel more comfortable.  I love it also because it has a lot of products.
5,Guelfkkdle,"This is honestly the best app I have ever used it can scan all types of things including food, body washes , shampoos and lots more and the best part about it is it‚Äôs free but I would 100% buy the app if I had to with how good it is it‚Äôs the app I never knew I needed!"
5,BreaBee Lakes,"All the time I spent in these stores reading the back of things, seeing stuff I don‚Äôt understand,  all just ended with this app!!! And Anything that‚Äôs not good for you, they give you better optionsüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ so perfect thank you!!! üíï"
5,meaghan456843689,I love using this app and was even more surprised I can scan my skin care items. I just hope one day we‚Äôll also be able to see the chemicals in pet brand food and shampoos
4,sfm zpm klm,"Ok so the only reason why this doesn‚Äôt have 5 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt recognize everything but anyways‚Ä¶ this is a great app I want you to get it right now do it ! It will only show you what to stop using so you can protect yourself from bad dies, food,skincare products, and more????!  GET IT please :) ;)"
5,MsMay19,As more and more harmful chemicals are allowed to be put into our everyday food and products it is nice to have a way to choose less harmful options. Only way to make this app better would be to add a supplements category.
5,ITchecksoutapps,This app shows what food is healthier and what food is not. This app can also scan bathroom products. Any unknown product you can fill in information. Use the barcode on your item to scan it. :)
5,Rsc516,Words cannot describe how much I love this app and how much it has changed my life. I‚Äôm the healthiest I‚Äôve ever been and a lot of that is thanks to Yuka. I did a complete overhaul of products and food and now I don‚Äôt purchase anything without scanning it first.
5,TennisLvr592,This app is AWESOME! It tells me what foods aren‚Äôt good for me and tells me why with many helpful details. I also love how they give you recommendations of what you should buy instead. This app is also great for cosmetics. I never realized how toxic my favorite products are!
5,Nsunshine4,"My Sons and myself all found your app well over a year ago, it has changed our lives drastically.  We have changed our way of eating by learning from your app what is in so much food that is NOT good for us. We all feel so much better both mentally and physically from learning so much about what NOT to put in our bodies. We can‚Äôt thank you enough for putting this app out there, we have shared with so many people both near and far what it has done for us. God Bless you and yours, Nancy & Sons‚ù§Ô∏èüå¥"
4,Dad Taught Me,"I‚Äôve only used the app a few times, but have noticed on three occasions, that the identical cosmetic product(s) has/have two conflicting ratings - one ‚Äúexcellent,‚Äù the other ‚Äúbad.‚Äù What accounts for this, and how does the user know which rating is valid?"
4,Lexi N Walker,I find this app to be very beneficial and educational! Easy to use & access while grocery shopping! I wish it had information on if products are banned in other country as additional information!
5,Orange Gatorade bottle,There are millions of products that it classifies no matter how small the brand is. I was looking up a really small Romanian brand of hand creams and it immediately showed all the information about the product.
5,WHO TOUCH MY SPAGHET!?,"Scanned some shampoos, lip balms and other things around the house and got rid of a few bad ones. The app also gives multiple recommendations for alternative items with better ingredients"
3,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòøüåûüåû,"Honest review a feel like a lot of the ratings on the Yuka app for me personally were inaccurate there were a lot of things that I have scanned with this app that have gotten 50 or lower but in my personal experience I believe they are really good products. But Yuka does also have accurate ratings also, But this is just my opinion."
5,Please helllp,I don‚Äôt write reviews but a friend told me about this app since he has health problems so I‚Äôve been using it as well. Works really well and super informative when making purchases or deciding what to eat
5,Lindsay Coxwell,I believe this app is one of the most amazing things I have come across as a teenager trying to find things better for my skin and health. If you are looking for a app to show you the difference between good and bad this app is a must!!
5,Mar12is349,How did I not know about this? Amazing job thank you to the developers. Flawless app which also gives you alternatives if the product you scanned is bad. 5/5
5,Chloe KM,I‚Äôm so cautious with everything I feed my baby. I make all of his food myself so this app definitely comes in clutch when it comes to selecting the best foods to use. I‚Äôm a make up junkie so it‚Äôs also super helpful with selecting safe products.
5,Sahibos22,"I love using this app, because It saves me so much time when I do my grocery shopping, I just scan the product and I immediately know if I wanna purchase it or no, if it consists beneficial ingredients or not. Thank you guys for this app! I love it!"
3,mrs-davi,"I can scan products and see how they score, but the other functions aren‚Äôt working. None of the flagged ingredients are highlighted in full ingredient list or called out on main screen to click on. No recommendations are listed and can‚Äôt add a category. Just goes to blank screen when I try."
5,Jnicoleüíã,"Such an amazing and informative app! I never knew products had such horrible things in them and this apps helps me SO much when I‚Äôm shopping,I‚Äôve recommended this to ALL my friends ! I‚Äôm not one to write reviews but this app definitely deserves one and 5 stars!!"
5,sbparent,"I‚Äôm a new app user. A sales clerk recommended to me after she observed I was looking at ingredients in various products. I‚Äôm unclear what makes a product excellent or bad, while I‚Äôm pleased that over half of the products I normally buy are excellent (and sad half ate poor or bad). Ugh."
5,WP0512,"This app save lives! Although some times you may have to upload an item that is not list, but it‚Äôs very easy to navigate through. I would highly recommend!!!!"
5,Jr Mint84,"I am obsessed. I love learning about brands that I thought were healthy brands only to find out about the hidden dangerous ingredients.  I love that Yuka has healthier products as alternatives. This app has swept thru my office, changing our life habits!!"
5,Lolo Jones H,"I use this app for skincare, makeup and food. I‚Äôve become so much more aware of all the harmful additives that are used in our daily lives. I am a much more conscious consumer. I have converted my parents, grandparents, and friends into Yuka fanatics. Thanks for making the app free!"
5,David- fired up!,This app helps you eat better by providing information about products. This will aid you in making better choices to eat which will eventually help you live a healthier life.   Thank you!!!
2,R.S. R,"Scan a can of soda, it tells me it‚Äôs a bad soda and there‚Äôs a healthier soda I should drink instead.  Scan a bag of chips, it tells me it‚Äôs not the worst bag of chips I could eat but suggests a better bag.  This app isn‚Äôt really interested in affecting better wholesale food choices but it does a good job of suggesting more expensive ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù brands of the same junkfood that i should buy instead"
3,Getwood,"I really like the app. It‚Äôs very helpful in making good food choices. However, the free part comes at a cost. With a brand new phone and unused email, I gave this app a try and sure enough I got blown up with spam shortly after. So the ‚Äòfree‚Äô part is made available by selling email addresses to spammers. Why else would it be mandatory to use the app?"
5,roskshhsxjhxhxbxh,"I LOVE ITTT is not only good with food products but also with cosmetics and it also gives you the reasons why they are good or not and in case they are not good they give you an alternative, it is the perfect app. I don't understand why no one talks about it."
5,ButterMouth,"This feature is the best, and this team is on fire with communication and reviews normally developers ignore reviews but I‚Äôm sure me and others appreciate them reaching out to ensure that things are working in order. :)"
1,NON OF YOUR üê∞,This app needs to be free to search up if you gonna make a app that you can see what people like and don‚Äôt like maybe you should not have a membership just to search up something that you don‚Äôt know. I will try it agin but I give this a 1 star for now cause it does not make sense to cost money just to search up a foodü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1/10 for now but if anything that is not free that should be free I‚Äôm done with this appüëçfor good BYE. Oh one more thing NOTE TO THE OWNER: UPDATE THE APP  AND MAKE IT FREE NO üí¥ TO SEARCH UP FOOD. BYE‚úã
5,Voltron43,"I just downloaded this app, mainly for the list of additives. It wasn‚Äôt working as other versions did. Customer service was awesome they fixed the problem and responded to an email complaint. Great and thanks"
5,JosieBklyn,"I‚Äôm on sodium restriction now and this app is great for showing me, with just a barcode scan, what some better choices are. I need this kind of help so I can avoid going on medications because it‚Äôs shocking how much salt is in everything."
5,Twiggletss,"We unfortunately really do not have an insight into our food anymore. I fret such as ‚Äònatural flavours‚Äô appera good, but in reality are typically harmful chemicals. This app gives you the long desired insight that you need to see what you are choosing to put into your body"
5,Bytheletter,"I‚Äôve learned that a very expensive skin care line that I raved about is pretty toxic. Quite literally, found a product rated ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô, that is pennie‚Äôs to the dollar and does the job well!"
1,*B‚Ç¨X,"This app spews nonsense! One example: I scanned my fiber supplement and it said it was bad, then it recommended energy drinks instead, which have been causing issues in our society and are terrible for your health.   The rating lacks common sense and leads gullible people into buying extremely expensive foods that are seemingly ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and are potentially giving this app a kickback? If not what is the motivation for leading people to worse options.?"
5,Gabby Sewell,"To put it simply, I use this app before I buy anything. I love how it tells you exactly whats bad in certain things too, and why its harmful. I have the premium version and I use it ALL THE TIME. I don't think I will ever delete this app."
3,MikeStanek1,I wanted to like this but I started questioning some of the scores it was giving. I decided I‚Äôd be done with it when it gave a natural hot sauce a score of ‚Äúbad‚Äù for having too much sugar and sodium. I took a look at the label and the sauce was almost nonexistent for both sugar and sodium. It made no sense at all. Sugar was literally 0% and there was a negligible amount of sodium.
1,kalikiss,"I wanted to love this app - but now I think it‚Äôs worthless. When I scan, I get one reading (bad) and when I type in the name I get a different one (excellent). What the heck. Wish I hadn‚Äôt paid any money for it. I tried scanning the product with another food scanner and it came up with the right product - yours came up with an older version. I might think it was the label but the other app got it right!!! Makes me really distrust your app."
4,spectrekid68,"Could we use it to log food for entries in the health app? Since this app already has all the nutritional info, it would be so neat if I could just tap ‚ÄúI ate that‚Äù, and have the nutritional info logged in the health app. Then I could actually keep track of my values over time."
3,Hiyori0218,I love this app and it has helped me find great alternatives for my daily products but I have an issue. I am allergic to mineral sunscreen and I keep being recommended mineral sunscreens. I used to get recommended Korean sunscreens which is what I like to wear but lately it‚Äôs all American mineral sunscreens even when I scan a product that is not with mineral.
5,TiAnn Nicole,"I love the app! I‚Äôm not sure if there is a feature yet for bioengineered foods and/or protective coated fruits and vegetables. I guess it may be a hard ask, but it would be amazing to know so that we can make the absolute best decisions for our families. I love the app either way."
5,777AURORA777,I tried the free version and quickly updated to a subscription to get the full benefits. Yesterday I used the app on my trip to Trader Joe‚Äôs. It was so helpful to be able to make quick decisions without studying the labels.
5,Devan8768,Literally thank you so much for this app. Found it on TikTok and it‚Äôs so good and I‚Äôve only used a few times but I think everything is free ( I really hope it is) it gives you really good info üíØwould recommend
5,kaisonM,I love this app because it tells me all the nutritional facts about foods that i scan. I scanned all my snack items and kept the green scoring. this has helped me become more helpful and now i feel great!
5,Kgddfhgd,I love this app so much and the idea behind it. In todays society it is important to be mindful of what we consume in our daily lives and Yuka has been very helpful in doing so as they even provide a better alternative to a harmful product.
5,Gameplayer22,"I don‚Äôt buy prepackaged food or body care without scanning it first!  It benefits my tiny grandsons, too!  I‚Äôm so thankful for my friend showing me the app, I show all my friends, too!  Thank you to the dedicated group who put YUKA togetherüíõ"
1,projet013,"I think on its face this app is a good idea, but ranking breakdowns do not take consider the means of application of products. For example, some ingredients are harmful if ingested by mouth and if that ingredient is present in hair spray, that hair spray will still get a negative rating as a result. Even if the ingredient has no chance of oral ingestion.   I think this app needs a serious rework that goes into greater detail regarding the ingredients and the route of exposure each ingredient has."
5,look past this app seriously,Mostly all the products that I‚Äôve been using were cancerous and I had no idea. Insane how people can buy things for their everyday use and basically put themselves in danger.
5,Norita Luisa,I just now know about this app and I love it. Good explanation for each product and in my case is a great help because I have no idea how to read a label unless is the obvious for example too much sugar or saturated fat Thank you! I will soon become a member
5,GreatAppY'all,"This app is amazing!!  It gives you ratings on food and if they don‚Äôt have the food it is easy to add it to their system and they rate with the nutrition facts, cover photo, and ingredients.  This is just so helpful!"
5,Benji82718,Thank you for making this app. I‚Äôm in my 30s and this changed my life. I‚Äôve been eating terribly so hopefully it‚Äôs not too late to reverse the damage. You guys are true hero's and are seriously changing the entire world.
5,MsObrave,The best app ever! Okay thank you for finally helping the consumer. Only app for have ever wanted to give money to. When can we scan clothes?üôÑüòÅ I have told all my family and friends and they are using the app too.
5,P.TheQueen,I haven‚Äôt even used the app yet (downloading now) & already rated a 5 just based off of the advertisement. This is brilliant !!! Now people can see for themselves when I tell them how bad some things are for their health !
5,Su mula,When I heard about this App a year ago I never thought that I would actually use it.   During my pregnancy I wanted to eat more healthier choices and BOY this app helped me A LOT !   This app is amazing !! the only down fall I wish it scanned/ rated pet foods.
5,thrdnug,This app has changed my life let alone my whole household. Health problems we had almost completely diminished. Now knowing what‚Äôs actually inside the stuff we use and eat every day! I love this app!!! This app will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!
5,jnelson03,I had to throw a lot of stuff away but it gives recommendations on what to buy in place of it so that you can complete whatever you have to but in a healthier and more environment friendly way
5,VanderReview,I have switched products throughout my house because of this app.  From my deodorant‚Ä¶sunscreen‚Ä¶cereal‚Ä¶snacks‚Ä¶shampoo...  Thank you so much to the founders and to all those who read and rate labels so I don‚Äôt have to.
4,Pioit08,"I love the app but I feel like things like sweets should have a different type of rating, there obviously not good for you but because of the sugar content it automatically makes it a 0/100 even though it doesn‚Äôt have any harmful ingredients.."
4,mirak1234,"This is a great idea and this app is very user friendly. The only issues I have is with the suggestion section of the app (ex. I scanned my chai latte concentrate and got laxative tea as a better option, I had chick-fil-sauce and got suggested beans). I think this I nice section to have and if it work that would be great."
5,Noahü´é,It‚Äôs became almost second nature to scan something before i buy it for myself. I like this app because i‚Äôm and athlete and it helps track what i should eat and what i shouldn‚Äôt.
5,Golden2315,I feel much more comfortable with what I eat and drink now due to this app. I highly recommend this app for those who want to watch what they eat and drink.
5,Lily or Ninny,Loving this app!   I especially love seeing alternatives to items I had been purchasing but recently found out that they contained ingredients I am no longer comfortable consuming.  It‚Äôs easy and fun to use!
5,Leecy559,This app is extremely addictive. You will scan everything you have and everything you shot for just use it. You will not be sorry and you will be healthier for it.
5,BK memar,Yuka had opened my eyes to a lot of products that I thought were good.    I really like the way it breaks down the rating do you can make a good decision  Also the way it suggests a similar product that rates higher
5,kevinrichardkaiser,"This app has helped me make healthier purchases. It is especially beneficial because we have 13 month old, so I can make more informed purchases when buying him snacks."
1,SuzyB0901,"I'm learning about the foods that I thought were healthy, but are not For this reason I like the app. Thne only thing I don't like is that the camera stays on unless you close out the app after every time you use it. The camera stays on in the background which is definitely a privacy issue. Am I using the app incorrectly? Because I feel there are definite privacy issues, I cannot rate it higher than a one star."
1,Bcorn33,"As someone who tries to eat ‚Äúreal food‚Äù without additives, this app was completely worthless.  It gave a better score to something with many artificial, highly processed ingredients and a much lower score to a product that contained real ingredients only because the almonds in that product had more fat content.  As most know, almond fat content is not all bad.  As someone who is very conscientious already about diet, this is not a worthwhile app."
4,Casey_pandacls16,This app was a 5 star app. It had all the things you could ever want. How could you get rid of the overview option??? It was one of the most used features and helped motivate you to be healthier! Please bring it back!
2,Amycherri,"I paid $14 for this app and was over the moon.  I must have convinced 4 people to sign up that year because I found it so useful. When I realized, after a year, that I had to pay for it again I was extremely disappointed.  I will not continue to pay for something I use occasionally.  Hope the Yuka team is fulfilling their American dreams of wealth!  I just downloaded EWG‚Äôs app for free. Yuk."
4,CC906,"For the most part I like the app but it is confusing how they do ratings. I compared two different brand items with basically the same ingredients list, one was rated poor at 38 percent, the other good 63 percent but they had no listed differences. Makes me somewhat skeptical but pros outweigh."
5,flacorcuera,I have always struggled to find healthy foods and cosmetics but this app has changed my life! It‚Äôs so easy to use and I can finally make the right choices when purchasing foods and cosmetics. I love it. Best app ever.
5,ambiguouslie,This app will change the world ! I‚Äôve tried hard to eat clean organic foods . This app will assist me in putting nothing but great food into my body. Over half of my skin products are toxic  This app will assist me in shopping to make better choices .
5,Esseyma,"This app helped me to clean out my diet tremendously Free version works just fine, but gladly paying for it just to support them. Easy to use. Works perfectly every time I need it. Thumbs ul to the peeps that put it together."
3,mamagamaG,"Not up to date on some of the current healthy eating guidelines. I appreciate learning what chemicals are in a product, but don‚Äôt give products a bad rating because it has olive oil. That‚Äôs a FAR BETTER choice than something with canola oil, which gets high ratings.  We eat far to many foods that are processed or filled with  pro inflammatory ingredients."
5,jeaniesbeanie,Saves me time in the supermarket so I don‚Äôt have to read all the ingredients. Plus I am refining down what I eat to only good and excellent choices according to the ratings on Yuka. A great app for improving your health and cutting back on all the bad stuff we eat.
5,nyharuchan,"These guys are doing world a favor! Thank you to this app, now we know what to buy and what not to buy and i no longer have to put my glasses to read small prints on the boxes! I‚Äôll spread the word! Happy healthy eatingüòÉüçì"
5,Black Zombie Disc Golf,This app is very useful and lays ground work for a healthy household.  It's easy. It's fun. It's healthy.  There is a hidden cost though. You will have to replace all the products you just threw out because they are toxic and unhealthy. I'll send you a bill.  ü§îü§∑üèΩüòúThanks Yuka!
2,SATAKE9,"Company may be bought buy bigger companies. My electrolyte of choice recommended by a nutritionist says it‚Äôs too caloric with 1 calorie while a Gatorade drink has 10 calories says it is all good for calories, same drinks my drink says it‚Äôs too salty at 55 mg while the same Gatorade drink is all good at 160 mg. Why are they not getting the same rating. I am so disappointed I really liked this app, now I don‚Äôt trust it anymore."
5,Alllllllllllllli45678,It shocks me what is marketed as healthy in our stores but when scanned it tells a different story. I am making healthier choices for myself with the help of This app!! It‚Äôs laid out in an easy to understand way. Thank you!!!!
5,deaver93,"I don‚Äôt ever write reviews, but this app deserves a perfect rating! The developers intentions behind this one have to be to truly benefit everyone who uses this as a tool to discover what‚Äôs truly healthy or not. I can‚Äôt think these guys enough."
5,Karenish,"We use this app for everything and make smarter and healthier choices with every single purchase. What an awesome app, I‚Äôve shared this my family and friends. I cannot stop raving about this important tool that is really helping."
1,T_dAbreu,"Just added a product on the app, however, it did not read the nutrional label correctly. Instead of 130 kcal per serving it computed 13kcal, and gave it an excellent rating. I tried three times to alter the numbers myself, according to the label, but it was of no use. I saw other products with the same issue. Kellogg‚Äôs frosted flakes has a good rating while computing 13kcal per 29g serving, which is 120 kcal actualy, 10x more. Liked the app but I am disappointed at this mistakes. Needs improvement ASAP"
5,D do de,"Literally the best app on my phone, makes you check if stuff is unhealthy or healthy, also shows you hella stuff . If you don‚Äôt have it.. you‚Äôre literally missing out‚Ä¶. Literally download it . You won‚Äôt regret it"
5,40776,Unbiased and it tells you if there‚Äôs anything bad in what your drinking / eating and for even deodorants and lotions etc all types of stuff very useful love the app been using it for at least a year now maybe even two
5,Guillermina87,I mean.. I will say it again. The free features are just great! And the newsletters they send regularly are so clear and informative. Very easy to scan products while shopping! Thank you Yuka Team!
5,A magic brush,"I am so thankful for this app! It is so informative and helpful. I really appreciate when you don‚Äôt have an answer, you quickly get back. Thank you for helping the world become a better place. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,AngieFranks88,I use this everyday to choose the best products for me and my family. Learned so much about all the harmful things in our beauty and food products. I love how it will give you safe alternative suggestions too!
5,Texas Users,"We love this app & use it every time we shop!! We are sometimes very surprised that foods we thought were very good nutrition wise are not, and some foods that we never paid attention to are very healthy! Once again, great app!"
5,Frogs rule,My daughter told me about the app. I find myself using it everyday and making healthier choices when shopping. It‚Äôs so easy to use and makes choosing products easier. Love it!
5,Steph Sant,I love this app! It‚Äôs so helpful if you‚Äôre first starting off a healthy lifestyle switch. My favorite part is that it gives you alternatives to things you enjoy. I got everyone in my circle to download it and they love it as well!
5,jm12151922,"This app is so freaking cool, I‚Äôm totally obsessed. It would be great if we could take a screen shot of a product and scan it that way, especially since many people do online shopping."
5,keilaassa,"I seen someone sponsor Yuka on Instagram and it‚Äôs accuracy is phenomenal! I care a lot about my health and this app has really helped me when it comes to knowing the pros/cons about daily products I tend to use. Gracias to the creator, this is a great app! Highly recommend."
5,DHol1,"I don‚Äôt know why the app store tries to hide this app but it has definitely been a life saver when choosing healthier food and products. Highly recommend and Apple, stop hiding this app!!!"
5,Muffinhog,Would purchase this app if I could set preferences to check carbs in food. Trying to use it as a diabetic reference when shopping. Love being able to scan foods and even enter some that aren‚Äôt in the data library.
1,Vance Trieschmann,"Absolutely terrible. The names and product information is only correct ~50% of the time. The product names in the app are always something along the lines of ‚Äúhealthy energy‚Äù, instead of the actual product name. When I emailed the app developer she said she would fix it, but of course that never happened. Not to mention, the product ratings are bogus and inaccurate 90% of the time. Stay away from this app."
1,Razz341,"Learned about this app from a friend. Downloaded it. Opened it, and the first thing it does is force you to create an account (email name) with password. Then it tells me I may have an invalid email name. This is an email that I have used for years, double checked it and it still wouldn‚Äôt except it. How much faith can you put in an app that won‚Äôt even recognize a valid email account? Promptly deleted/removed this app."
5,BreezyBeeBee,Literally. I have thrown away so many harmful cosmetics and my diet has changed as well. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app. 10/10 would recommend.
5,Fan of Tile,"We had no idea how many preservatives were in our every day food, but when you have a disease that depends on the kind of food you eat, it‚Äôs kind of mandatory to know the ingredients and it‚Äôs alternatives, and Yuka does just that"
5,Lorac247,This app is very eye-opening. Learning that many foods that I thought were healthy are in fact not due to additives that are hazardous for my health. I like that an alternative that is rated better is offered.
5,VirginiafronTexas,"I love, love this app! It is very convenient to use. I love scanning products. I scan as many as I can to find better alternatives for family and myself. I showcasing this app on TikTok because I want to share how amazing it is! Thank you, Yuka! ü•ï"
5,Rafael Lupo,Yuka has completed revamped our kitchen/eating habits. From cooking more to eating higher quality food and completely avoiding processed foods.  We feel healthier and improved our lives in other ways too.
4,P.B.B.M.,"It‚Äôs an useful app, but I would like Yuca can rank syrups, sugar, pet food , medication, candles and everything somehow we consume and concerns the  health   Also there are some products with the same ingredients than others that have diferente punctuation , I don‚Äôt know why th inconsistency with the analysis of the ingredients"
5,Zoannepitt,This ap is wonderful for avoiding harmful chemicals in foods and cosmetics‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i use it while shopping It has opened my eyes to the lack of caring food manufacturers have for my health‚Ä¶.thank goodness to the wonderful people who took the time to do all the research‚Ä¶.‚ù§Ô∏è
5,1tepster,"This app is truly amazing! I‚Äôve always had questions about products, and now I can get firsthand information on each purchase. Thank you, guys, for this incredible tool. I‚Äôm eagerly anticipating your next innovation!"
5,Quwuebdnd,I downloaded this app for fun. But then as I start scanning things it shows me how bad a lot of foods are. I LOVE that it give you alternative options! A great way to start being mindful of healthy eating with just a scan on an app!
5,sheshhhhh 10999,Ya know i‚Äôve never noticed how many unsafe things are in the food/products we consume and this app was really just an eye opener. Plus it give you the info on why they are bad and studies on them providing evidence/reliable sources.
3,Chili bean14,The most important part of this app is that it needs to be accurate. It would be nice if submitting corrections was a lot easier. I choose not to use Apple‚Äôs native mail app so I can‚Äôt submit changes.  Why can‚Äôt info just be submitted directly in the app without the need to use email?
2,Alex jjjjj,"Why do I have to share the app in order to access the fields in the ‚ÄúTops‚Äù section when I‚Äôm already a premium user. I get that you want people to share the app, but I already do that with my friends and family without the app forcing me to. I pay for premium so don‚Äôt block any features. I‚Äôm very disappointed by this practice."
5,Angelb,I have been using this App for over two months. I was shocked at what is in my favorite even clean beauty products. I have swapped out almost everything and love the products.  It‚Äôs truly a buyer beware market.
3,catsax,"I was loving this app until a recommended ‚Äúgood‚Äù product (Up&Up Sport Spray sunscreen SPF 50) that I went out and bought 6 containers of, was rated as ‚Äúbad‚Äù when I scanned it. The app even recommends this product as a substitute for itself, appearing as ‚Äúgood‚Äù in the recs and bad in the review. I took a photo but I don‚Äôt seem able to share it here."
5,wvachfvhfvvfjf,The app is a great way to find out if things you daily use is healthy or not. Not sure if it has limit for non members though. I am not a member but I like the app very much. Very easy to navigate.
3,Coltrane da cat,They assume you have the Mail app set up so the only way to report products is if Yuka can open Mail app and then send the report. They shouldn‚Äôt assume that and offer more ways to reach out to them. Now I have to exit the app and co somewhere else to submit this issue
5,—Ç–æ–ª–ª–æ–ø–æ–ª,I want to express my gratitude to the developers of this app. It's the most beneficial app I've come across. I hadn't realized that I was consuming so much unhealthy and potentially cancer-causing food.
1,r. app,"I liked the app and subscribed for a year. Also wanted to contribute by spending time taking pictures and typing on my phone to input some products the app database doesn‚Äôt have. But today I found my account is locked without any warning, claiming I may have entered incorrect product info. Deeply frustrated by how the app handled the situation and treated a paying customer. Decided to request refund and not use the app any more."
3,Karebee,I use this app for help knowing which body products are safe. It‚Äôs been super helpful with that. However I am super disappointed that when I scan food it gives me no information about glyphosate exposure and other pesticides. It was what I hoped for when I downloaded this app.
1,Oscar D. Grouch,The app does everything as possible to push Trader Joe‚Äôs branded food and many other products of billion dollar companies with their versions of ‚Äúfat-free‚Äù ‚Äúlow sugar‚Äù and ‚Äúorganic‚Äù as possible. They also highly encourage you to eat as much seed oil containing foods as possible through a statement trying to manipulate its users saying seed oils are ‚Äúessential‚Äù to our diet but they are highly processed and are highly inflammatory.
5,Betterworldüåé,"This app is literally amazing. It‚Äôs unbelievable how much of our food has toxins in it. This tells you exactly what is in the food, and also gives you better alternatives to food with hazardous chemicals in it."
2,jaynoon,"Mostly helpful app, but I have two main issues so far:  1. I reported a product in the app months ago that they said was ‚Äúgood‚Äù but the label directly refuted the app. It still says it‚Äôs good months later. This is flat out dangerous and irresponsible.   2. They say MSG is bad, which is not based on real science. I pointed this out and they said no it‚Äôs bad (based on what though?) where‚Äôs the real study? It‚Äôs well-understood that the demonization of MSG was some racism propaganda from decades ago.  We‚Äôve truly found this app useful. But not correcting dangerously wrong information in a timely fashion is gross and makes me question all the results."
1,Apd0113,"This is a comment on how the app assesses cosmetic products, not food, but their communication on risk is misleading/incorrect. Risk is a function of exposure and hazard (risk = exposure x hazard) and the app clearly states they are only assessing the hazard of the individual ingredients of the product. By designating a product as ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô they are completing neglecting the potential exposure to the chemical - such as the concentration of the chemical in the product or the exposure route (ingestion vs inhalation vs dermal application). IMO this is fear mongering and bad science."
5,94984432646,I never knew so many things I was eating and putting on my body or bad for me this app helped me find out what you put on my body and it thank you very much to the people who created this.
5,GG1022:),I was told about the Yuka app a year ago and I can‚Äôt believe that 1/2 the food I was eating was filled with hazardous chemicals. Thanks to the Yuka app I now scan all the items I buy to make sure I‚Äôm eating good food and not chemicals!! Thank you Yuka!!!!
5,jansails,"I have sincerely enjoyed using Yuka, & learned so much from having the access to information on products used or consumed.  I have shared the app with 8 people so far, & they are just as enamored with Yuka as I am."
5,kensler316,After we found out about this app we have been eating way healthier. About 45% of the food we buy now is better for you. I also know what to  get for breakfast and lunch at school.
5,jrsails,I have been in the food business all my life. But I thought it was good wasn‚Äôt so good. This is a great app. It will help you make the best choices for what‚Äôs good for you and your family and your grandchildren. Thank you
5,Skipalito,"I am very impressed with this app, it has opened my eyes for products which I have used for years and found out that they are not healthy. Thank you for your unbiased research and for this excellent app"
5,Tek_D,This app is incredible. We are identifying issues with products. I was unaware of having chemical preservatives added to many other unhealthy choices discovered using this app; five stars for my review.
5,Brittany Mondido,I don‚Äôt purchase anything without scanning. I now have my entire family and friends circle using it including my 5-year old niece! Great education and fun for shopping.
5,sjd1994,"I‚Äôve always been curious about the health effects and risks for all those ingredients I can‚Äôt pronounce. Yuka has helped me to understand what I am putting in and on my body. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!"
1,Ef Duo,"They don‚Äôt tell you that you can‚Äôt just search for the ingredient unless it‚Äôs on their list. In fact, they make it look like subscription will allow you to do this.   Also, with their cosmetics and skin care, they don‚Äôt consider quantities of ingredients, nor do they consider that small amounts of some things can inhibit growths of allergens like bacteria and mycotoxins. It‚Äôs bad science and misleading on multiple levels."
5,Quiteablizrd621,"I NEVER write reviews. But I just had to say THANK YOU SO MUCH for this amazing app. You guys are amazing and I love that you are independent. Paying what you can for Premium is SO WORTH IT to keep this going. Again from my family to all of yours, thank you so much."
5,HJB1953,This is a great app.  I‚Äôm using it on all the foods I buy and has helped me weed out some of the bad actors.  I‚Äôm pre-diabetic and hope that someday they‚Äôll add on a feature that will indicate whether choices are okay for diabetics.  Keep up the good work!
5,opistole,This Application has helped me so much in choosing the correct food and cosmetic products for my body. I am very thankful to the creators for thinking about human health and helpings us understand what is all made with and what can harm us. THANK YOU!!
5,Raeee1818,"I started scanning stuff in my bathroom and I feel personally victimized by certain large, overly fragranced candle and soap stores. I‚Äôm excited/terrified to the scan the rest of my stuff üò¶"
5,k326!,"I absolutely love this app! It‚Äôs great for my kid to see the color codes too, it‚Äôs helped us get him away from the junk food I‚Äôve been telling him is bad.. but now he can see it and willingly decides not to eat it! Amazing app so helpful!!"
5,Nadifresh,Love that this app is not sponsored by a big corp to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô or away the reviews. Just facts shared and love the healthier/better suggestions. Love this in this day and age where everything is a scam or makes you sick in the long run- appreciate the transparency. Thanks guys!
4,LunerMoonWitch,This app is so good! I feel like if there was an option to see why some ingredients and other things are bad it would be better because well understood why it‚Äôs bad and why we should avoid it :D  -have a great day!
5,Gustavo1214,This has helped me see what I‚Äôve been using and eating and seeing if it‚Äôs healthy or not. Thanks for this app because without this I would have never known what I‚Äôm putting in my body.
5,SuzyQHamlet6,Have used my fit bit and app for 10 years. This is amazing!  This has totally changed what I‚Äôm choosing to eat. Seeing the hazardous additives and preservatives makes me really choose healthier items. Such a great app!!
5,blowthewindüå¨,This app allows you to scan products at the store to see how healthy is it. Also gives you recommendations on better products.
3,Sylvviaz,I am seeing more and more people recommend this app and take it too seriously.   1) The scores are inaccurate when it comes to products with even just one‚Äùbad‚Äù ingredient. And can be a scare tactic. 2)It doesn‚Äôt have a full understanding of some ingredients especially in skincare products. As there so many misconceptions when it comes to some ingredients in skincare that aren‚Äôt actually harmful if you do your research and know how much is used in the product.  Overall has great potential and quick way to look up whats in each product you buy.
5,besssstttt gameeeee EVER,Hi thank you for your time in reading this comment this was a very good app and recommended mostly helps you understand how bad things are for you and how good things are for you thank you for your time
4,Chris_coy,Neat but product search being a members only feature is a little odd. Also a feature to sort/categorize your favorites list from healthiest to least healthiest food items would be great.
5,Michellemarlatt,Love this app it helps you make better choices and the things you thought were healthy are not.  I also love that it gives you a healthy option.
5,Cabletekk,"This app does quite a lot from not just telling you what‚Äôs good and not good for you to eat , but giving you the reasons why they‚Äôre not good and recommendations for replacements for those foods"
5,Drekonomicz,"When it comes to eating healthy it‚Äôs one of my top priorities, with that being said this is a wonderful app to use if you‚Äôre into knowing what you put into your body. Thank you"
5,MerMotta,"I love how it gave me the option to pay the subscription, very clever. Also I enjoy how it gives me a chart on all the good and bad things I‚Äôve bought. I use this app for everything"
5,Talky Tina,I have only had this for a few days and I cannot stop scanning stuff. I am sending it to everyone! It has so much good information! I keep finding more thing that ar so informative! Thank you!!
5,JulesPrays4Patience,"Also would like to have a way to easily add items that I don‚Äôt readily have the barcode for. Otherwise, it‚Äôs great for in-store shopping popular items!"
1,kaitlynjo3506,I liked this app until they asked me to fill out information on an unknown product. I put all the correct information and submitted a photo of the label but it didn‚Äôt work because the photo was blurry. Then I got an email saying they locked my account saying I submitted a selfie when I never did. I‚Äôve been emailing the Yuka team hoping to fix my account but no one has gotten back to me.
5,carter.pm,This app is so easy to use and completely changes your life. Made me realize the stuff I‚Äôm putting into my body and suggests me real alternatives that are still cheap to substitute and improve my health
5,leemal831,This app has totally changed my life. It‚Äôs helped me purge all the harmful chemicals in my family‚Äôs food and personal products. I‚Äôve been using it for about 6 months and our health has improved drastically.
1,kvkschutz,"As a first time mom, I loved this app. But since I‚Äôve recently tried using it, I can‚Äôt see the analysis of the ingredients - which is incredibly disappointing and frustrating. All I‚Äôm able to see if the rating and general list of ingredients, but I have no idea which ingredients are potentially harmful. Unfortunately, paying for a premium membership, as well as updating my phone and the app - have been unsuccessful."
5,M1d2i3v4,I just became a premium member and I love the quick and easy scan for products. I‚Äôm already finding out that products I thought were healthy were not. Just reading the ingredients on the label doesn‚Äôt tell the entire story. In seconds all of the information is there including hidden additives.   I heartily recommend this App to anyone who is concerned with eating well and using products that are not harmful.   Thanks to the developers for a truly great app! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
5,okurtt lol,I actually really like this app. I literally scanned my whole beauty products and oh my gosh!! I had such expensive ones yet so poor!!! Thanks to this app i will now know what products to buy. I use it everywhere now!
1,Oreo_anna,So I‚Äôve used comparable apps before that have worked well for me. This one‚Ä¶not so much. I have used it only for beauty products so I can‚Äôt speak on food. This app told me that the ingredients in my dermatologist recommended CeraVe are poor but the ingredients in Clean and Clear deep clean are excellent? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I feel like they are paid to push certain products after seeing this. Disappointing because I wanted to like this
5,fc Zurich hh did if f F,"This app is so easy to use and addictive!!  I check everything, food, cleansers, toothpaste..etc, etc I also like the fact that it shows you alternatives to use with better ratings A must get!!"
5,shqipe4666,Overall amazing app but some items can not be scanned so we should be able to pick any item and list it on the app and it automatically stays on the app forever
5,A-Donkey,This app makes food shopping super easy.   It will tell you right away what to avoid and what to substitute the unhealthy food/health products.  I recommend
5,Hitechprincess,I'd be a whole lot healthier if I'd had this app 30 (or more) years ago! üòä Thanks for creating such a useful app for selecting the best products on the market! I am now scanning... ALL THE THINGS...
5,SoccerOmaNow,"Thank you for all the time, energy and creativeness your team has put into this app!  You really are making a difference in people‚Äôs lives and it is very much appreciated!"
5,J#Savage,"They are the best, keeps me and my family safe from hazardous chemicals in food that mostly the United States allows us to consume and give a rating to see and judge, I live this app and share it all the time.."
5,John C Indy,"The older I get the harder it is to read some of the ingredients on labels.  Now I just click and read the app.  Didn‚Äôt realize just how unhealthy some things are.  Try it, you‚Äôll love the app."
5,‚ù§Ô∏èüí•üëåüèΩ,"To see how many harmful chemicals and pesticides are in our every day foods, it‚Äôs saddening. This app has truly been an eye opener for my family, God bless the creator of this app and I hope others can use it to help their lives as well."
5,__0g_sanity,I‚Äôm going to look into buying their premium version because I appreciate this app so much. Just writing this as a thank you to the founders and the 11 people running this app. Much love to you guys
5,Hhheeeiiidddiii,If you scan something and it‚Äôs bad they will show you recommendations on what products that are better and it‚Äôs not just for beauty it‚Äôs for food too and it will tell you why it‚Äôs bad!
5,Wish yourselfs luck,"If you're focusing on health and self improvement this is your app. Not only is the in-app purchase ""unnecessary"" , in a good way, it's incredibly useful app for health and well-being. For that reason I have granted it five stars."
5,mrsglossy,Very helpful app for us who don‚Äôt have time to read all the labels but want to know it‚Äôs great to know that companies care about some of their products and it‚Äôs a quick and easy way to get in and out
5,jlozy,I‚Äôve just started looking into ingredients and trying to take mine and my families health more seriously and at first it felt so overwhelming and this app helps SO MUCH!!! No longer do I feel overwhelmed with the help of Yuka!!! Thanks Yuka people for caring so much to invent this app !!!!
5,Lowfrequenciez,"This app is exactly what I was looking for. Super easy to use and lists just what I want to see. It saves me so much time, I just scan an item and it lists all of the ingredients in order of worst to best."
5,No more money wasted,I had NO idea how many products were bad that I have purchased and am using.  Even my Est√©e Lauder facial cleanser was rated bad.  Name brands I thought I could trust to be good we‚Äôre NOT and it‚Äôs pretty shocking to say the least.
5,Auntie nana123456,"This app is so much fun to use. I really helps make intelligent decisions. When I shop I don‚Äôt necessarily look at prices, but ingredients. This app takes a lot of the effort out of that for me. Really good product and kudos to the developers!"
5,Mommy Vero,Shared this with my family. I like that it gives you detailed information about additives in food. If you scan something that‚Äôs flagged as bad it gives recommendations for healthier alternative.
4,Chaylux,"Depending on what you‚Äôre looking at can affect whether it‚Äôs BAD to YOU or in general I guess BUT a good balance is what it is about for us so it definitely helpful BC of the way it‚Äôs broken down, but I don‚Äôt always agree fully with the ratings! But what they base it in matches EVERYTIME so great way to evaluate!"
5,LD from NJ USA,"This app has truly changed my life, for the better!  I have done my best to decipher how healthy/unhealthy different foods are. This app puts all the information at your fingertips in a moment. No more guessing! I love this app!"
5,Jen and Erik,Thank you for making this app. I am shocked at how many ‚Äúnormal‚Äù items I use that are not good for me. I even learned that one of the lotions I was using effects my thyroid and I have Hashimotos. I can‚Äôt thank you enough!!!
5,ThaRealOl'Lady,Thank you for developing this. It was good to know the best and worst foods in my refrigerator according to countries that have standards (I am a US user‚Ä¶sigh). I try to avoid msg and salt for a health condition. Just a mild suggestion if you are starved for ideas for app expansion!
5,flappjacklolfan,"Hello,I am very baffled with this app I scanned every product/cosmetic and couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes this app is amazing keep up the good work.I checked my dressings and was absolutely shocked on what I was consuming"
4,Raojgi,Absolutely love the app! I just wish there were more options under their recommendations for similar items. Especially everyday makeup items. Other than that love it!
5,Brett106,Anyone who gets into health/fitness will come to the realization sooner or later that almost everything we consume (in the US) and use is poisonous to the human body. This app gives the little guy a fighting chance at health
5,brohinmm,"Great app, I use it every time I shop to quickly scan and see what‚Äôs in my food. App works on donations and is worth paying for (even though it‚Äôs free!) keep up the great work team"
5,roberttheartoliviarodrigo,This app is so useful!!! It‚Äôs really been helping me indentify what‚Äôs healthy and what‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs so dependent to just be able to pull out my phone and scan! I can‚Äôt wait to use it more in the future! Thanks!
5,Peabody Rob,"This is a jarring, scary very necessary eye-opening experience using the yuka app. It‚Äôs wonderful actually. Even the stuff that I thought was healthy as poisonous. So this means the poisonous stuff is actual toxic waste. God save us all."
5,Ray-luv,This app is amazing! It has helped me with picking out better healthy options for food and cosmetics. I‚Äôm really being more conscious on what I feed or use for my family and me. Keep up the great work!
1,Yeah_really,"I scanned multiple items and it was completely inaccurate!  The sodium, saturated fat, protein, fiber and sugar levels listed on the app were way off compared to what was printed on the box in my hands.  I can‚Äôt believe how far off it was and again this was multiple items.  People obviously aren‚Äôt double checking this and blindly following this app"
5,Yael Yoga,I love this app and it really help me make better choices for myself and my family. I keep recommending it to others. Thank you for the team that made this happen
5,philipsapr,I hope this app keeps getting more and more developed.   My only fear is for the information to never be false.     It‚Äôs important that products are accurate with the ingredients.
3,One yogi,"I dont understand why calories are tracked and ranked and some of the brands that get higher rankings are still big box brands with plenty of poor categories. I didnt see any category for organic, gmo, or bioengineered. Those are more important categories than calories or sodium for that matter."
5,Cinda M,My dietician suggested this app to me. It‚Äôs amazing . I found the ‚Äúdiet‚Äù foods I was eating contained so much more sodium I needed plus other bad additives and gives great suggestions for alternatives. I now am losing weight again and feeling so much better!
5,Lindi428,I love this app!   I use it to make food choices when I don‚Äôt want to really cook.  I have now given up some food choices I thought were good and I paid for it to support the work!   Thanks
5,pagy65,"I am loving this app! Helps me to make healthier, conscious choices when I‚Äôm grocery shopping! I am learning more about the ingredients that are not healthy for me and choosing better options! Thank you for your advice Yuka team ü§©"
5,behdjdododknabdjxkxnx,I‚Äôm literally in love with this app already and I just started using it. It‚Äôs so helpful and has taught me so much about my diet. I LOVE the fact they include so much information and I‚Äôve been considering buying the premium version already. PLEASE BUY ITS SO USEFUL
4,Chicken nugget pizza sauce,It really works and I keep scanning things around the house to see if they are good for me and I‚Äôm getting healthier because of this app and the only reason why I put a star down was because I have to be a member to do some stuff
5,JayCDM,We used to eat stuff that we though were healthy but now we know that it‚Äôs unhealthy to eat it so now we‚Äôre eating stuff that is healthy this app has been very helpful shopping is better now.
5,nnnel,"This app is AMAZING, why you may ask, because I am now able to consciously determine if a product is made with ingredients I personally want to use or avoid. It is so worth it!"
1,Abbeykate12,"I scanned an organic fruit product. It has four ingredients, all natural, all organic. The app said the item had a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù nutrition rating and it recommended ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choices. The ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choice was rated nutritionally ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and contained about 20 ingredients I can‚Äôt pronounce. It was not organic and full of GMOs and inflammatory ingredients. How could that possibly be a healthier alternative?! Immediately uninstalled the app. Beware, and actually READ ingredients."
5,hdfrjvegdhgzv,This is the best app ever everybody needs it it tells you when food is bad good excellent or poor and it works on everything except for books and stuff and it works on beauty products cleaning supplies and food
5,Dswartout,You‚Äôll never stop scanning again. Everyone needs this especially since our country doesn‚Äôt care about how health.
5,ansonofficial1,Just wanted to send a quick shoutout to the developers of this app and the community on it. I‚Äôve been an avid user for years and it‚Äôs so helpful. Thank you for making this utility!
4,SUMPTERFAMILY,Celiac disease gluten allergy is different than wheat allergy some people have gluten allergy and wheat allergies please add wheat to the menu on things to avoid and I will give you five stars. It‚Äôs very important because all things that are gluten-free are not entirely wheat free which can be deceiving to some people.
5,Kendra2099,I wanted to know if there is an app like this for pregnant women? Or if the app itself can have a setting for pregnant women? It would help a lot so I don‚Äôt have to google EVERYTHING
5,Healthy63,Love the APP.  Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have not elected to buy the product after scanning.  Thanks for helping me make informed decisions.  Reading the packaging is so misleading.
5,Knockondoor,This app really helps me choose healthy options at the grocery store without having to read each label. You just scan the UPC & it summarizes it for you so you can choose wisely.
5,Happy banking!,"My brother shared the Yuka app with me!  We spent an hour in my kitchen and pantry reviewing what I had purchased- now on to the grocery store!  The info is easy to understand, explanation is detailed, and the product comparisons are so helpful!  I love Yuka! I posted them on my social media, and shared that I am not a young influencer, yet my joy and enthusiasm are vibrant and youthful!!   One more thing, I emailed them about their wonderful-ness and had a sweet reply in a few hours! Great staff and communications!  I lovvvvveeeeeeee Yuka!  Lori Matthews Arizona"
5,Desertjayne,"This app is an absolutely must for today's living, it can make you aware of all the garbage they sell in grocery stores that the FDA tries to convince us is healthy."
5,@drnourhen,"I really really like the app. I would like to be able to browse through more categories like mayo, barbecue sauce‚Ä¶ thank you"
5,0rangknight,"My only wish is that it let you adjust your standards for food. For example, if I‚Äôm trying to gain weight and I want high calorie foods it‚Äôs not super useful for it to be flagging stuff for being too caloric."
5,Kissimmee Lady,I had no idea how many hazardous chemicals are in our foods and personal care items. Finally an app with consumers health in Mind.  Now I can make smart choices for my family.
3,Jordyn McClary,"I like this app so far, but a huge part of my decision making when shopping (for beauty/personal care products) is based on if the company is cruelty free or not. Information about third party testing, parent company testing etc would make this app perfect!"
4,GioLl0239,"My family has been using this app for about a year now. And ever since, we‚Äôve started eating much healthier. I would like if you guys updated the Top Products tabs more often, especially the Body Washes tab."
5,Majv$:?/&?&:!,"This tool has been amazing for me to use, helping me make smarter/safer choices when spending my money. It helps me place my body health first with amazing convenience."
5,Jones Photo,"I don‚Äôt buy anything without scanning it since I found Yuka! It‚Äôs fantastic! my makeup was poison and my food wasn‚Äôt much better‚Ä¶ check with Yuka before you put anything in or on your body!  Donna Jones,Santa Rosa, Ca."
5,M&NDeY,This app has literally changed the way we look at food in the grocery store & in our pantry! We‚Äôve made so many better choices & love the recommendations!
5,bad2zebone,"I‚Äôm a hypochondriac and this helps me feel in control on things I can help myself with. I just scan something and if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs going to give me anxiety, it‚Äôs goodbye. Thanks so much"
5,JoshViki,Hi! First things first I love the app. I wish I could scan dog food. It would be awesome to scan pet food and see the ingredients that is harmful. Treats too! Maybe the feature will help animals live a longer life by avoiding harmful ingredients!
5,sharonmac2,I love this APP it‚Äôs easy to use and wow I‚Äôm surprised at the number of things I have purchased are bad!  Also love your substitutes to know what is best to purchase.  thank you so much for coming up with such a healthy helper app.
4,JessMaue,I think this is an excellent app. I‚Äôve been using it to show my kids better options to eat and drink for years. But now that there is a visual for them they keep scanning EVERYTHING!!!!  I just wish it would show that the food dye is bad‚Ä¶
5,Vacation is Life,This app takes the confusion out of truly eating better. I no longer have to Google all the harmful ingredients in foods and I can make a conscious decision to be eat an unhealthy snack. I very much enjoy the app giving me better alternatives.
5,estefani C,Love this app it does so well breaking things down and helps me make better choices every day. I‚Äôm obsessed with it I literally scan all my items before buying them!!!
5,Goujoujinsama,Great if used correctly. Make sure to compare similar products to check if any information is outdated. You can upload new ingredients easily. No problems at all.
5,lsrd,"Since I downloaded this app, I am scanning everything in the house and at the store. Ditching everything that is bad and considering those that re poor, for best options or what can be tolerated. Thank you Yuka."
5,jfjfjdir,"Helping me weed out foods that are literally killing me! Unlimited scans and no be literally went through my kitchen and found many, many additives that I want to cut from my intake and feel better."
4,xKEWPx,This would get a 5 star if one feature was added. The ability to locate where this product can be bought at in general or store specific.
5,likealottapigs,I like this app for making sure I pick the best product out there. I went thru my house and scanned everything and got rid of the super bad stuff.  Thank you.
5,Kay'sMemaw,The app is fast and easy to use. Plus it allows you to add a product that hasn‚Äôt been reviewed yet and gives you an evaluation right away!! Will be using this a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Psshhhhh,Will do my utmost best to spread the news about the app. Who knows how many countless diagnoses this app will stop. Amazing! Capitalism has done much good but our food and cosmetic industry need a wake up call and this app will do it!
5,Widhdhdoc,"I love everything about this app! I‚Äôve been scanning everything and I love the interaction. User friendly, informative and fun! I would love to see this expand into supplements!"
1,loliolololkli,"1. stuff that it says had a litttle bit of protein are usually incomplete proteins 2. You can‚Äôt search for products without paying 3. you have to share the app to look at most of the high quality products 4. high sodium isn‚Äôt bad. its a vital electrolyte you use for sweating. it‚Äôs only bad when you don‚Äôt excercise and let it sit in your body creating health problems. 5. just because something is high calorie doesn‚Äôt make it unhealthy, it‚Äôs where the calories come from. A milkshake isn‚Äôt unhealthy because it has a lot of calories, it‚Äôs unhealthy because there‚Äôs a ton of sugar 6. it puts stuff that are proven endocrine disrupters at low risk which is crazy"
5,issenga,I use it all the time for when I want to try a new beauty product or snack and I feel as though it‚Äôs really helping me be healthier and put better products on my skin.
1,brookander,"There are countless products on this app that have multiple ratings. I had a primer and it was rated good and bad depending on which listing it was..? I‚Äôve also found spelling errors on the app, etc. I really liked it at first but it‚Äôs clearly low quality. You shouldn‚Äôt be providing this information when it‚Äôs not even correct in the system."
4,Nev727,"This app - Scans barcodes - Rates food and other items from 0-100 - Tells you all of the dangerous additives  - Gives healthier options  The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because it is inconsistent. I scanned a box of apples. No problem. I scan a 100 percent fruit bar, and it says ‚Äú Yuka does not rate fruit products‚Äù. Another example similar to this is when I scanned laundry detergent. Other than that, I recommend the app to anyone who wants to know exactly what they are putting in to their body!"
5,mcdrcd,For those of us passionate about living healthy this App is a must! You will see exactly what u are putting in and on your body and be prepared for a shock! So many hazardous ingredients are in products we believe are good for us!
5,Kriss Harvey,"If you‚Äôre concerned about what you put on your body, this app is for you. Everyone should use this before they purchase any food. Thank you for making it free!"
5,wffbx64v,I love this app i used to never know what type of shampoo and conditioners to use until i downloaded this app i highly recommend this app if u don‚Äôt know what type of shampoo and conditioner are good for u
5,Karen in north FL,"I love this App.  Not only does it tell me when something is a poor health choice but it gives me a good health alternate!  Easy to use, easy to pick a better choice; what else could you ask for!!"
4,reviews from gigi,I love Yuka and use it for ALL my products but there are some updates we NEED! I would love it if they allowed things such as slime or cleaning products just to make sure it‚Äôs safe! But besides that this app is great. It helps with everything so yeah have a good day/night!
5,beauty_ismy_name,I really love this app so much. It‚Äôs very informative and easy to use. I‚Äôve learned a lot of what I‚Äôve been putting in my body (which I regret) ever since I started using this app. 10 out of 10 for me!
1,brandonm1217,I‚Äôve tried countless times to add rogaine but it will not work no matter how many different pictures I take. I try to contact someone but it tried taking me to the mail app on my iphone which I don‚Äôt have downloaded and don‚Äôt intend to download. If someone can fix this issue I will change my rating as this is a great app but if I can‚Äôt add products then it is kind of useless.
5,Tamu's Corner,This is the best app I have ever downloaded it‚Äôs so awesome and helpful I have just downloaded it and already I have recommended the yuka app to my friends and family keep up the good work. From a loyal customer
5,Cwebb92,I am really loving this app! It is very user friendly and if something with a product has the wrong ingredients I can scan the label so that it is correctly updated!
5,xerceslewis,This app has helped me to see what things are good and what aren‚Äôt for my child! I love it and feel like such a better mom and healthier person
5,dhvj he sc,"Wonderful tool to use. I have been able to look up baby products, lotions, and foods to check for hazardous ingredients. Big fan!! Thank you!!"
5,nanajudy9,I have truly enjoyed using this app. I have realized so many things about the things I buy and consume. It has changed my shopping experience!! Thank you!
5,S.Y. BILLY,"Amazing. This app changed the way I eat. So many foods that I have eaten my whole life are not healthy and I have been removing or substituting them for other, healthier options. Merci to Yuka."
5,Gretta Gardner,This app has helped me understand so much about what I'm eating and putting on my body. I appreciate the knowledge and am changing up so many things to improve my health and lifestyle!
5,RMCSBC,This is a very important app. I use it every single time I shop for food & products. It has taught me so much and opened my eyes to the terrible ingredients that are allowed to be in and on our bodies.
5,Tskangas,"I give credit to this app for helping me lose weight - in addition to a mile on the treadmill each day. If a food item is rated ""poor"" or ""bad"", I don't eat it."
5,Earclot,Love this app. Just bring your phone into the store with you and start scanning. So much easier to make educated decisions on what to eat without having to decipher the ingredients and nutrition facts on your own.
5,Saraalinia,"This app is so eye opening, thank you to the developers for bringing this insight into our lives in times where people are bombarded with advertisements for big companies‚Äô profits and not the wellness of the people."
5,Erica6523899,I‚Äôm not the person who leaves reviews for apps but I had to come here and leave one for this god sent. Thank you so much to the creators of this app. Health is #1.
5,Sugar free Yooper,"This is the best app ever, never realized what a bunch off garbage was for sale in our grocery stores. I do believe this is the first step in fixing our messed up health care. Way to go YUKA, keep up the great work your doing!!!"
5,Sonne T,"Would love to send y‚Äôall something, just don‚Äôt use Applepay. If there‚Äôs a way I can send y‚Äôall a check, I would do so. Love the app, and I love the cause. Thank you, y‚Äôall are a very lovely family."
1,Frustrated Consumer 76,"I signed up for Yuka premium because I support their cause. The app is very well organized and informative. It makes you aware of ingredients, ranking, and gives better alternatives. After using the app more I NOW SEE THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT WITH DIFFERENT RANKINGS AND INGREDIENTS. I'll search a product, and it shows up multiple times, with different rankings. The app says the rankings are ""100% independent"" I now question the integrity of the app."
1,Angelsofwishes,This app is going to confuse people on what health really means. Stop scanning items that are clearly processed goods. Just buy actual Whole Foods that cannot be scanned.  This app told me that my grass Fed butter was bad because of saturated fat. But then a cereal I had that literally had soybean oil was good for me??? Haha what a joke. Saturated fat is amazingly healthy. Our ancestors knew this and ate it daily. The chronic disease epidemic is from CEREALS and packaged goods. Not from butter‚Ä¶cmon do better.
5,Paluma1016,I cannot believe how amazing this app is. Makes you realize how uneducated we consumers are. What we believe to be healthy isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve changed my entire shopping since using this app.
3,L‚ÄôGaby,Literally subscribed for the application and paid for premium less then an hour ago and the application has crashed 3 times. Can‚Äôt give my full view in the contents of the app since I just accessed it but crashing has definitely irritated my view.
4,clintmathes,"I wish this app would also warn you when there are seed oil‚Äôs in the product, such as canola oil, sunflower seed oil, corn oil, soybean oil‚Ä¶ This is important to me, not to everyone I understand, but to me it is! Other than that, this is a good app and I recommend it!"
5,ritzstudio.com,"This app will help you clean out your life. So many products today are made with so many chemicals. We threw out shampoos, deodorant and many other items that we thought we safe."
5,KikaGarciaM.,Highly recommended! Perfect if you want to make sure about the real quality not only of the food but also of the products you use for care and beauty. Top app!
5,ben shaprio hamburger helper,I just downloaded this app and I already love it. I really like how it tells you what ingredients are bad and why they‚Äôre bad too. It‚Äôs also awesome that it‚Äôs for food and cosmetics! I highly recommend this app :)
5,kdp12344,I had a really hard time grocery shopping with now knowing what‚Äôs in our foods. This makes life SO much easier!! I won‚Äôt shop without it.
5,Shellybolina,This is the best app ever! I am so excited to scan everything! Sad to see the chemicals in our foods. But happy to have found this app. Those who use it and only buy excellent rated foods and toiletries will live longer. Real Talk!!
5,Bowieosis,"I couldn't believe all these dangerous chemicals were hiding in plain sight in my food and beauty products. Thanks to Yuka, I now make much healthier and wiser purchases. Everyone should use this app! Thank you, Yuka team!"
5,Shawmendad,"After using this app for less than a day, I can confidently say that I would not hesitate to pay $100+ for access to this resource and database. Absolutely mind blowing."
3,Maevers15,"Yuka has been very informational on the products I use daily however I think it would be even better if it recognized and rated a larger variety of products such as candles, air fresheners, cleaning products, and essential oils. It would also be useful if it could scan QR codes."
5,LillyüòÅüëç,This app allows you to easily scan food and beauty products easily in store before you check out and pay for something potentially harmful to you. Love it! My skin and hair looks sooo much healthier now.
1,BucksL‚ù§Ô∏èverYUMmmmmm!,"I‚Äôve been into nutrition for years and I‚Äôve used many apps for tracking food, finding alternative foods to ones that aren‚Äôt as healthy. This app CLAIMS it will do that, however it doesn‚Äôt. It misleads and conflicts with other very reliable apps which are backed by doctors and nutritionists. I deleted Yuka after four days of use. Not only was it inaccurate, but many foods are missing."
5,Priska üíï,"I honestly love this app ! It‚Äôs super helpful and useful, it tells you the truth about a lot of the products, that will lie about the composition of their product. This app has helped me control majority of the things that I eat and drink. Totally recommend it!!"
5,xgeargvs,"Been using for years since my French friends recommended it for me, it has been a game changer especially with my kids now. I can track the level of nutrition for each items and now we can aslo see the recommendation for substitutions!   I wish i could afford the plan, cause it gives you additional features without scanning them. Maybe in a few months.  Bravo Yuka"
5,T-RexCaCaü¶ñüí©,Amazing app genuinely use every time I go to the store it‚Äôs just something I use to scan things I am unsure if they are good. P.S. scan your water you‚Äôll thank me later.üòÑ
4,matizap,Yuka is a amazing app dont get me wrong it helps me a lot but when I was scanning a product (Vaseline) it said 0/100! Vaseline is one of the best products made and it was rated 0/100! Anyways thank you for reading me review and I hope you can realize that Vaseline is GOOD!
5,AmyKat0054,I‚Äôm new to Yuka paid version and have been using it for personal care items. Next is good. It would be nice to flag a food allergy and have it pop up in red so I don‚Äôt overlook it
5,#1Simone,What a wonderful app. I believe in the work you all are doing and I put my money where my mouth is I supported the app and anyone reading this review. I encourage you to do the same.
5,malloryy12,A co-worker shared this app and began using it the next day! Fabulous and already making changes to the grocery list! Didn‚Äôt realize some of my ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô chips and foods were not healthy!
5,taylor2248,"I love this app. Totally worth it. I thoroughly enjoy the story behind how this app came to be, and I hope they never change or become sellouts. Thank you to the family that made this app."
5,RaMpAgE_JONES,"Referred by ‚Äúthe Nanny‚Äù anti cancer site.  This is the best.   Makes getting BP, diabetes, heart disease under control for ALL family members.  I also, scan everything.  Eating healthier is not that expensive or as hard as you think.  Thx. Laura ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,onehealthymom,Completely change the way I shop for food and products. I use it on almost all my grocery shopping trips now. I must have.
5,Smartiepant78,"Love the app! What I thought was healthy choices are not so much. Have arthritis, fibromyalgia and heart problems so needed choices that were proven healthier because of ingredients. Can‚Äôt believe advertising!!"
5,Goodwinannag,"This app has helped me so much! All I have to do is scan one of my everyday products or foods and it will tell me if it‚Äôs toxic or not. Say it is toxic, it will give me tons of awesome recommendations for clean products/healthy foods!!! SOO helpful!"
5,Temple runner (773),"This app is AMAZING! Everyone should use this. If your interested in the truth of what‚Äôs in the products you buy that go on or in your body this is it. To the developers, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I‚Äôd give this 1000 stars if it let me."
4,AJOT10000000000,I‚Äôm enjoying the app so far and learning what to steer clear of but the recommendations aren‚Äôt very helpful because the products aren‚Äôt related. I scanned a just egg product and recommendations were tofurkey and vegan chickens not an egg alternative.
4,nuecy12345,"When tried to search for Oreo cookies, I had to become a member in order to see the Oreo cookies data. I canceled the request because I had to become a member‚Ä¶ hence I‚Äôm sure I would have to spend some money to become a member. Nice hook but no catch‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs why I rated this app ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
4,mimi22_enzo,I am enjoying this app but I noticed that when I scan dog food or treats it doesn‚Äôt do it so that would be something nice. I‚Äôm a first time dog owner and it would definitely come in handy since I don‚Äôt want to be giving my dog crappy cheat dog food and treats
5,healthkickC,Extremely helpful when trying to purchase the healthier options for my family!
2,Bklopeas,So just found out about this app and in 5 minutes playing around the house and it said my Aldi brand of juice was ‚Äúpoor‚Äù but a Walmart brand it suggested was ‚Äúgood‚Äù only difference was about 4 grams of sugar more in the Aldi brand but the Walmart brand was 3 times higher in sodium! lol  I‚Äôll take a couple grams more of sugar over 3times more sodium please lol
5,salica_kave,"Easy, informative and perfect tool for anyone who cares what they put in or on their body. I am no longer buying anything before scanning it. It‚Äôs super fun too!"
4,CrackerSmacker69,"I really really hope this app has been factual on all its info it gives on additives, preservatives, recommendations, etc because it‚Äôs completely changed my diet of the last 6 months for the better (I hope)"
5,hangindrywall,Amazing site I‚Äôve been using it for a month people see me in the supermarket using it they ask me what it is I show them explain how it works and they immediately download it
2,jampcat9,I‚Äôve scanned about 8 products so far and none of the recommendations have been comparable to the original. Example: I scanned Fairytales lice prevention conditioner. The first recommendation was a brunette dry shampoo spray ?!!? A less minor one: I scanned a sunscreen lip balm- none of the recommended lip balms had sunscreen in them.  Unfortunately this app hasn‚Äôt been helpful to me at all.
5,Hil03046,I was introduced to the app by a friend and have been using it a lot. It‚Äôs helped me make a lot of better for me choices . Thank you for providing such a valuable resource.
5,MimiConway,Even my kids are into scanning items and seeing the score. We love the Yuka app. It has changed the way we shop.
5,Twest26,"Please if you could add a way to filter by prices of food in your local area, this would help individuals find affordable healthy options!"
2,Benicio,"I paid the premium account and then it locked me out of my account and then when I‚Äôm using it at the store, I can‚Äôt even sign into the premium because it won‚Äôt send me a password and then it locks you out because you don‚Äôt know the password and then the password reset doesn‚Äôt work. Absolute waste."
5,Tinyhag,Very informative.  So many additives in foods that we are unaware of.  I‚Äôve thrown away half of the foods that I thought were healthy.  Plus cosmetics that I will not buy anymore.  Thank you!!!
5,Kary K.,"I love this app, it really is amazing to see how much toxic ingredients are in our food. Now I would love one that works in Mexico, because Im here more than in the States. That would be amazing! Thanks for this incredible app!"
5,Juleecw,I love this app! I love that it‚Äôs free and that they link studies to back up all of their claims. I use this app all the time! It‚Äôs really helped me eat better and feel less anxious about what I put in/on my body!
5,MBcorona,This is such an amazing app! Easy to use and the information is life saving! I highly recommend and have told my whole family about it.
4,CallMeByeFelicia,"I live this app and i recommend it especially if you want to keep track on toxic food that unfortunately is still sold in the market, yet i wish they included pet food"
5,Abbieslove,"Thank you for all you do! I can‚Äôt walk in to a grocery or Cosmetics store without using your App. I take longer to shop, but al least I‚Äôm more informed about my choices. I‚Äôll copy this into an App review on Apple.  Have a happy holiday season, Jill XOX"
5,Cali‚Äôs Reviews,I am so glad I got this app and I share it with everyone I know. Thank you Yuka for helping us to stay informed about what‚Äôs REALLY in products and how to keep our families safe.
5,lil GT girl,This app is so fun to play around with and I‚Äôve already shown the app  to all my friends and family. I love going to the grocery store and scanning everything in sight to put into my cart!  This app literally SLAYS ü•ï
5,Yazeet.,It‚Äôs a great app they don‚Äôt have many catches just a couple member features that you don‚Äôt really need anyways. 10/10
5,xhvnter,The only feature missing is a leaderboard of the highest scoring products for each category. Then it would be perfect.
5,tsdecker,"First off huge thank you to the developers, at least 3:4 of my cosmetic stuff is actually really bad for me and i didn‚Äôt even know"
1,ApatzkyA,"Please take a look at the sources Yuka cites to conclude ingredients are hazardous. I was looking at a few of them for cosmetics, and they are completely bogus. Many of them contradicted what hazardous effects Yuka claims. Some studies only consist of theories, which the authors explicitly state there is no evidence to support them. Others, say testing was done on rats, but human studies don‚Äôt show the same results.   The ratings on here certainly aren‚Äôt accurate."
5,M.Brown28,This application is a great tool.. It has helped me get rid of a-lot of foods and products that are not beneficial to my health.  I also love that this app is a mutual party and does not promote anyone product over another.
5,BbisBest16,I am so happy to find this app. It is a game changer for our attempt to eat clean. Thank you Thank you Thank you. I have been telling everyone I know about this amazing app. Keep up the good work. üòä
5,jam 2da,I have enjoyed 100%. I appreciate the purpose and it has saved me many many times not to choose certain food items. Thanks
5,Gejiebdjdjdjgsiajs,"Thanks for this app, now it‚Äôs time to expose our food in USA!!! Take a stand and do what‚Äôs right for you and your family. Why is USA still serving food additive that are banned in other countries. Make it make since."
2,ElyUchiha,"At beginning I thought it was wonderful, but now I am not sure, because products that are expensive and they are recognize get a poor or bad results, and drugstore product that leave my hair dry and ugly get high results. Also their recommendations of products are very similar. I do not know if these companies paid for publicity in this app. BE CAREFUL!"
5,Zebragirl(:,"YUKA allows me to dig deeper into the nutritional value and what‚Äôs hidden inside foods I‚Äôm shopping for and eating.   My favorite part of this App is the Recommendations feature, which helps me make healthy swaps for bad choices."
5,Purgeblood,I alway knew we had bad stuff in our food but now I can see and read and really research more.  Awesome app If your looking for something to help you make better food choices.
5,Jazzy4239,"Be in the know about what you put in your body. Amazingly surprised at how good this app gives you vital information about what we consume. Food, drinks, toiletries. Excellent resource and easy to use. Thank you to the makers!"
5,bkmayes,It‚Äôs criminal the hazardous chemicals these food companies put into our food. Most of our food is banned in 30 other countries. Great App. I wish they would identify seed oils and bioengineered food.
5,Lavawarrior05,This app has totally transformed my shopping and my health. I am so so so grateful to the people who developed this app. I share this with everyone who is interested in making better choices with their health!
5,SteveO Baseball Dad,What an eye-opener! This half is a huge help to identify actual healthy foods no matter what the Internet tells you. Love how it explains the ingredients in detail and research from other countries of the potential effects.
5,PrimeTimeDuvall,This app is helping me out a lot. I do still want to check the credibility for myself but this helps a lot and they tell you alternative options
1,Spinner Girl 2020,Got a new iPhone 15pro and since then this app won‚Äôt work.  Says my email is incorrect but yet it works on my iPad.   I contacted you guys FOUR  times and Apple twice and yet not one person has even acknowledged my requests  let alone offered any assistance.  (and I‚Äôm an Pro Member to Yuka).  Love your app but VERY frustrating and disheartening that I can‚Äôt use it and no one will help me.   Exactly what am I paying for????? ü§¨
4,someone that tried this app,"I am a child and I have no clue what my email address is and my parents don‚Äôt know either so I cannot get into the app!üò°üò†üò≠ Another thing, (no offense to the creators) I honestly don‚Äôt trust any app that you give personal information to. üòë"
5,Etsuko7,"This app is very, very helpful.  I use it whenever I shop and trust the rating.  It‚Äôs hard to believe that there are so many bad stuff out there.  Thank you Yuka for changing my life."
5,PatttttyyyyYyyyy,I absolutely love this app!!! Has been extremely helpful when purchasing food or beauty items!!   I‚Äôve also recommended this app to friends and family members.  Thank you Yuka ! üòÄ
5,Leo8664,This app helps me choose what‚Äôs best for my health while shopping. I recommend it to those who like to eat healthy foods in their daily lives. My two thumbs up to the creators of this app.
5,Jackfrost1411,Great app. Will try to provide data for the unknown products. Hope you‚Äôll add more features in future.
5,sal billy,"Easy, informative and a life saver. So much fun to walk through a supermarket and scan the food that you thought was healthy, and the best part is this app gives you healthy alternatives. Awesome!"
5,Breannluke,Tired of being in the dark with what I‚Äôm putting in and on my body! I‚Äôve told all my friends and family and they love it and now know what is really good and bad for you!
5,exploregrant,This is a must have if you‚Äôre wanting to eat healthy or if you want better ingredients in the things you eat and other products
5,Davdais,I love this app. It does a great job of rating products and telling you which products to avoid because of harmful additives. Would definitely recommend to anybody.
1,pjmobil,"The App is Berry fast but dangerously misleading. It looks like the authors used IA to bring content on the table, but unfortunately the data is old and proofed wrong. The newest and the corrected researches show that the existing food Pyramide causes that people become obese and diabetic. If you follow the app you will regret to choose the wrong food pretty soon. Read the correct data with books from Jason Fung and Dr. Berry. They proofs what I stated!"
5,JEC2006,"I have been scanning my hair products, throwing out the poor and bad ones and buying the good ones. The site suggests less chemically harmful products."
4,Bexster K,The app is decent but it considers fragrance as ‚ÄúNo Risk‚Äù.  I‚Äôm wondering if they do the same for natural flavors. Anyone going down this path knows that fragrance and natural flavors are a huge red flag.  The app is easy to use but I hope they don‚Äôt take money to better rate products.
5,cryptocritique,Easy to use. Helps kids to learn to read labels. Very helpful to use while shopping to make better choices. It will make you eat better. What a great app
5,JenRossi,This is an incredible app!  Grocery shopping is a different experience..I‚Äôm able to choose healthy items.
5,c9mp,"The app is great, they don't make many apps like this anymore.  It's a completely free, super useful tool, that isn't overloaded with horrible and annoying advertisements.   For that, it deserves 5 stars."
5,GraceDTJ,I was in Costco today using this app and some nice lady noticed and politely asked me about it. Her mother is diabetic and apparently not doing well. I showed her the app and how much I like it. She‚Äôs definitely getting the app.
5,Corie.525,"I appreciate that they cite their sources/research. It allows for self education and empowers the consumer to assess the significance of those studies to their needs/concerns. The more transparent and available information is, the better!"
5,TreyMoney253,This is probably one of the only apps that can truly change your life. I just started using this and I‚Äôm already cutting out so many foods from my diet.
4,EmsVilardi,"This app is great in becoming more aware as to what we put in our bodies. But it does not evaluate the harmful seed oils (sunflower, soybean, safflower, grape seed, canola, etc). Just scanned my skippy peanut butter and it came back as ‚Äúgood‚Äù but the ingredient list was mostly seed oils (vegetable, soybean and rapeseed oil!) No way that should be labeled as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù"
5,Sidiwndjiekk,"This app is amazing. Exposing just how terrible the things we eat can be. It tells you how it‚Äôs bad, what‚Äôs bad that is in it, & gives you better alternatives. Must have"
5,crossroadcreep,"I have needed something like this for so long! I have tried to do my own research of ingredients in the past, but this app makes everything so simple! I am so thankful!!!"
5,Mgomez75,"Wow!! I love this app so much. So many foods I thought were good for me were not!! I really like that it gives you healthy alternatives. Also works on personal items too like shampoo, creams etc. Amazing!!!!"
5,The king of yellow,It‚Äôs nice to find a mobile app that does what it‚Äôs supposed to. It actually makes life healthier easier and better for all humans for free!
5,Elizabeth Dischler,I can scan all of my product before buying. This takes the guess work and google searches out of the equation. I love this app.
5,1112222233333344444,So over facebook in a group i was told to download from a post so i am giving it a try.. im not sure its actually true or not but hopefully its not fake cause most of my shampoos are risky
5,Maksbsnslsnsisnsksbsisnsn,This app is amazing. For someone who wants to avoid all things toxic but doesn‚Äôt know what specific ingredients and additives to watch out for this app is perfect!!! Even if you‚Äôre a pro this app is just awesome.
1,Self-Starter 25,"I‚Äôm working on my dietitian degree and when someone in my family started using this app, I checked it out.   To be blunt, the recommendations are terrible and make no sense. High sugar, highly processed foods are recommended and score higher the low or no sugar foods. And there seems to be an extreme weighting towards sodium content over everything else.  Do not use this app if you care about your health"
5,O's mama,I love this app. It has helped my family remove toxic bad chemicals that we put in and on our bodies. Thank you Yuka!!! Please add more products to your library like laundry products etc.
5,dallpet,"This is probably my favorite app in all existence other from entertainment apps. In a world that‚Äôs so unjust, we have no idea what to trust what‚Äôs in our food. We thank you!!! Stay healthy everyone!"
5,dfkfkdjd,So many times I‚Äôm tempted to buy something that looks delicious and I scan it and then I end up putting it right back on the shelf. Excellent app.
5,yonzerrrr423,"As a health freak, I‚Äôve waited for an app like this for years. This is the easiest to use.  User friendly. Life-changing app I‚Äôve ever used. Please please please everybody use this app. Help us help each other."
2,nesjie,"I like this app, but find it very frustrating when I purchase an item rated ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, then when I check a month or two later it has changed to a rating of ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. I have wasted a lot of time and money due to those changes, which is very frustrating."
2,Consumer:/,The app has major connection issues. Let‚Äôs say for example I f you‚Äôre out shopping and not connected to Wi-Fi you won‚Äôt be able to scan anything. It continues to give an error message. I‚Äôve checked for updates even deleted and reinstalled it but nothing fixes it.
5,torhula,"I can‚Äôt thank you all enough for this app. I feel so much more confident in the food and products I use on/give my 2 and 3 year old, and myself."
4,King Duro,I like this app it‚Äôs introducing me to items that I never thought I would like I might be paying more for the items but the benefits are better off this app goes along way. Keep up the good work.
5,Red roe,"This gives me more time to shop ü§≠ the food that I always buy needs to be scanned ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòú thank you for sharing your invention, Benoi, Julie and Francois for this app! You guys are genius ! More power ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
5,Healthychicky,I love this ap. It is so helpful and easy to use. The information it provides has changed the way I shop and feed my family. Bravo!
5,Cattsee,I was eating so many foods that I thought were healthy. It wasn‚Äôt until I got Yuka that I realized how many unhealthy additives were in my diet. I will not shop without Yuka now! You really need this app!
5,DevinJMcKee,I‚Äôve been sharing this with everyone I know and those I meet in passing . Everyone should give this a try and start thinking about what we are ingesting.
5,emma ten,why that product is bad‚Ä¶ This app helps with breakfast lunch and just giving the kids a good healthy app I definitely recommend you getting it if you like healthy good food!!!!!
5,greylady654,This is the most brilliant app you could download. So grateful that someone finally came up with product review for plain folks to see what the heck we are putting in our body‚Äôs!!
5,IvonneBombon,"Why am I just learning about this app? I‚Äôm throwing away more than half of my cosmetic products, thank you Yuka, you make it so easy to understand! Every household should have this app."
4,Bgula5,I feel it would be so easy to expand to restaurants and honestly surprised i cant look up whats in some of my fast food dishes. Definitely would recommend updating that
5,Annamm50,Won‚Äôt buy some of the products in my house again poor rating
5,Goodfella_05,I find myself scanning items in the grocery store more than I thought I would of. I love this app and it‚Äôs a must have for anyone trying to eat more healthy.
3,Hteoo,This app is great to easily track how much sugar and fat and all that stuff is in what you eat but also it is very fun. The app can also be misleading. The app will rate something poor or bad because of the sugar or fat. This makes the food or drink look bad even though it‚Äôs not that bad.
5,aaallleeeccc333,I don‚Äôt usually write reviews unless it‚Äôs REALLY bad or REALLY good. I think this app is an example of how EVERY APP SHOULD BE. I know it might sound like I‚Äôm over hyping it but I have a unconscious habit of noticing and critiquing the smallest of details. Spotless.
5,Turner_1517,This app is amazing! Gives you all the information you need to know about food in less than 5 seconds!
5,Ageerice,"I am new to the app, but I have been really impressed with it so far.  -It is easy to use.  -They have a huge database of products.  -I was able to add a product with no problem.  -Their support is insanely reactive. They responded within an hour.  - Most of all, they are real people trying to help other real people make a positive difference in their lives. If I knew anything about anything that would be helpful to the app, I would totally want to work with them!"
5,Quemetta,When can we get an update where we can scan products with high protein content? Seems relevant if you ask me. Absolutely fantastic app btw
5,Seakingsun,I was shocked from what I thought were healthy foods. What an eye opener. I switched to recommendations on healthier alternatives and just love it. I fell better and have shared this app with hundreds of my friends.
5,marrjjo,"if you want your products to be clean and don‚Äôt really know how to start, this app is a great way to find things as you go ü§ç love how convenient it is, scan & find out ü§ç"
5,Dannicakes,Thank you for creating this app to help me make better food choices for my family. I had no idea some of the foods we love had so many bad ingredients.
5,Johnkrue,Yuka literally is a life saver. There is so much poisonous food and ingredients in 90% of what is offered in grocery stores. Spend a little time and scan labels with this app and it truly can save your life!
5,kvdig,"Of all the apps that I have had and do have, Yuka is in my top 10. I have recommended this app to many many many people and will continue to do so. Thank you very much!"
1,rubygl00m,"Its times like this i wish a zero star existed. As someone who works in cosmetics/beauty retail this app is a nightmare. i already know when a guest has this app open that i wont be able to help them because they've been brainwashed by this app. the information is extremely misleading, wrong and lacks any context, nuance, or practicality. please do not trust the information they provide it means close to nothing. TRUST PROFESSIONALS!!"
5,Monofurv,Amazing app I‚Äôm a guy that just uses anything but I don‚Äôt realize what I put in my body with this app it‚Äôs making me realize I should really take care of my body
5,Sweetsoaps,I use this app to cut thru the deception of healthy products. It will shock you when you scan the bar codes and see the hazardous chemicals in many well known brands! Educate yourself and stay healthy!
1,Nicodemus$,"The scan feature as a part of the free app is great. Stay in this area only though if you do not want to pay. I was in another part of the app and clicked on the wrong banner which signs you up for the premium subscription. While signing up is one errant click, unsubscribing is next to impossible. Very deceptive with how this is managed."
5,jammmm2848495834,"Thank you for making this apps; it's MIND-BLOWING, how the U.S has been brainwashed and think that everything is safe to eat. Food coloring, cleaning chemicals in our food it goes on."
5,Well this is great 372649,"It‚Äôs quick, easy and free. It also has a pay what you want subscription which is significantly cheaper than other competitor apps."
5,@Tw01,I love how yuka hasn‚Äôt been bought out by companies for better reviews. It‚Äôs accurate and helps you make healthier choices
5,Texas Boy Sosa,If I were to strictly go by this app I would eat nothing but water and vegetables but since that‚Äôll never happen at least I know where I stand as far as diet is concerned.
5,punchbunnymo,"Here I come sounding cliche- but I really don‚Äôt usually leave reviews for apps.   This app has changed my habits, helped me understand nutrition and what I put in my body.   Thank you so much."
5,JosielovesSimon,I love this app so far - but I JUST noticed 2 completely different rating for the same product - ODD. regardless this app had been a great tool for finding cleaner food and products ! Love this app!
5,thisappisshit124,This app is amazing. Completely changed my outlook on what I‚Äôm putting in my body and on my body. 10/10 have been recommending to everyone I know. I‚Äôm about to be the healthiest girl on the block LOL!
5,KGR5,This app is a must for knowing what‚Äôs good and helping you understand the products of every day. I only wish that in the future they would add nutritional supplements and medications.
5,Minneapolis Grandma,I live this app/resource. I‚Äôve only had it for a month and have used it many times. I make some meals for picky young kids so it‚Äôs helping me make wiser choices.
5,Ninabunjevcevic,This app runs perfectly and is so helpful about knowing what food are healthy. It has great recomendations of replacement foods and always links the research that they use. 10/10!!
1,Drew314159,"The concept of the app is good, and I think it‚Äôs generally well built but the ratings cannot be trusted.  They will give certain ingredients a bad rating, but ignore the context it‚Äôs used.  For example, an ingredient in my shampoo is hazardous because it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a ‚Äúleave on‚Äù substance.  For shampooing it‚Äôs not leave on anyways  They also rate MSG as Hazardous?  Is this a joke?  Studies have countless debunked the myth of MSG being unhealthy.   They also fail to rate seed oils as unhealthy compared less processed ones.  But that‚Äôs based on my own research, why trust me right?  Well why trust Yuka?   Either way it‚Äôs going to be incredibly biased, which is the challenge of making an app like this."
5,Amandashifflett89,I wish the pie chart would show things that you actually consume and not everything that you scan.
5,Thedarklord1987,This app is a must for anyone who is looking to cut out additives from food. It also gives information on how terrible these additives are and what they can do to your body.
3,wrgl31,Downloaded the app today and while I love the idea behind it I‚Äôm confused by the ratings. If you use the search function sometimes an item is listed more than once and can have multiple ratings from excellent to poor (ex. Pop Chips BBQ).
5,goodsforfree,Just found out about this app today and downloaded. Started scanning in my pantry and holy moly! What I thought was somewhat healthy really isn‚Äôt. Great app!   May I request? Have a similar app for pet foodüòâ
5,hjabsfh,It helps me and my dad buy things because he has diabetes and it is very hard for him to find food and it is very hard for me to find Products for my skin because it is so dry
5,Evaüåª,This app gives me so much comfort in knowing that what I‚Äôm putting into my body won‚Äôt harm me. Especially now that there is so much marketing that it is hard to know what‚Äôs best. Love this app
5,suzie Sweet,Love this app.   It saved me loads of time researching n reading ingredients. I highly recommend it.  Anyone on a journey looking to live long and healthy can benefit from using this app.
4,KasaiKame,"You are able to favorite products, but that is it. There is no way to create different folders. Other than that, this app has been great!"
5,.shaina.b.,"This is a very useful app , helps to tell you if  the ingredients inside are beneficial for you or bad . I‚Äôm glad I have this app . Thank you for whoever created such a masterpiece of this app  , so smart ."
5,gegedebg,This app has helped the family to eat better. I would like to see recommendations for certain health issues such as diabetes.
3,Bmelvinn,"I wanna love this app but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a hundred percent sold‚Ä¶ I really feel some of these products that are rated as ‚Äúbad‚Äù are inaccurate. Comparing the info on this app to others ingredient checkers, It seems with some products I check  the Yuka app is the only one that comes up with negative feed back."
3,kslane,"Some good information, but when comparing similar products the sodium content, especially, is inconsistent. Sometimes 95 mg of sodium seems to cause a poor rating, then other times a product can have 410 mg or more and be rated good. Just confusing."
5,bossladytx,Everyone needs to have this!! Scan everything. You will be so surprised what is in your products and food!
5,Helcha B,Yuka has changed my world. I feel so relieved that now with certainty I am choosing healthier options. I‚Äôve advised my friends and family about Yuka. They are all using Yuka now! Thank you!!!
5,Label chick,I love this app‚Ä¶it‚Äôs really helpful! I‚Äôm a product junkie so this app is really helping me save money as well as educating me on a lot of products. I appreciate having an app that‚Äôs educational and informative.
1,Fhndrjseboued,It seems that there is a lot of competing information on the app. There are multiple times within the first 10 minutes of using the app where I have seen two of the same items listed with completely different information. One listed excellent one rated poor. Just look up GoMacro double chocolate peanut butter chip.
5,loveit125432,I love shopping and using this app! It has helped me make such better choices and helps me keep away from food that has negative ingredients. I love this app!!
5,BotheredSpender,Ever used. It‚Äôs quick and easy and so helpful for trying to protect your health. I just shared them on my instagram today because i needed to put my few followers on game.
5,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuuuu,This app is great to use. It is so nice to be able to get info on the food you eat and buy..the creators sound so sincere about furnishing all the info..they sound like a great team
5,flightness,I absolutely love this app and have been telling all my friends and strangers. Scan everything in your home and throw away your bad products
5,win0202,So thankful for this app I never realized what bad stuff was in foods pls keep doing more apps like this I don‚Äôt even mind paying for one like this if they keep making more!!!
1,f_labbe,"I love the idea, but the app is not really working for me. The recommendations tab is broken (no recommendations at all, and no ability to elect a product category). Also, there is no information what so ever on WHAT is harmful and harmful in what way.  I would love some sort of surface analysis like ‚Äúthis product contains XYZ, which is harmful in ABC way‚Äù  Would love to see a fix/improvement soon"
1,frahadn,"The information provided by this app is wrong and misleading. Please don‚Äôt use this app to make your decision based on. Use common sense and improve your knowledge in most aspect of life so you can live a healthy life.  Here is an example: This is their scanner shows that have two different risk level profile:  Ingredients: Cyclomethicone Hazardous  Cyclopentasiloxane Moderate risk  Now for average person, this is great.  But the fact is these are two names for same ingredient! Two different risk level.  And this app is missing a serious information and knowledge about formulations, concentration level. Stay away and don‚Äôt live in their false positive or false negative world."
5,Chris Scalph,"Great app! Very useful because not only does it provide the good, bad, and ugly it will offer a better alternative product. Then on top of that details on the ingredients with scientific evidence!"
5,TwistedTater,"I‚Äôve never written a review for an app before, but I am for this one! Not only does it tell you what‚Äôs bad, it tells you why. If it‚Äôs carcinogenic, an allergen.. it lists it all out."
5,Mgquest03,I use it when I go shopping now. It‚Äôs a great way to help make better choices when buying food! Especially convenience food
5,FacetiousMonkey,Use it all the time to find clean products. One recommendation would be to add links to where I can find the products (where they are sold)
4,dp++,"Other similar apps have horrible privacy best practices and sell your data.   I can‚Äôt wait until we can further customize our food preferences!!! For example, specifying an ingredient(s) to avoid."
5,jakeabby04,I tried the Bobby approved app 1st . Then I found Yuka . I found the Yuka app more easy to understand and use . I love the way they give you the percent of how good the food your about to eat is üòä great app great work that Yuka is doing
3,fourohfour,"Please add lead, Serenity Puffs was recently found to have high lead content and this app rates them highly for ingredients.  Also I can't send feedback from the app because I don't use Apple mail, this is apples fault but please allow other ways of sending feedback."
1,Bubbles‚Ä¶idk,Recently signed in to Yuka using an email address I haven‚Äôt used in a while and within a week someone is trying to sign into my email and actually got in. I managed to stop it in time. Keep in mind that I‚Äôve never had a security threat before with this email and it‚Äôs been the first time I signed up for something using it in a very long time.
5,criv07,This app is truly life changing. I don‚Äôt buy anything anymore without first scanning it with Yuka. I feel that my food and product choices are now much healthier. Thanks Yuka!
5,BostonMike21#,If you are concerned about what‚Äôs in your groceries shop no more. This app is great and super easy to use. A must have for wise shoppers. Get it you‚Äôll be surprise at what you WON‚ÄôT eat anymore. It was an eye opener.  Trust me.
5,Ang09090909,I am thankful there are apps like this. So thank you to you 3 who designed Yuka! We need more people who care about these things and are doing something about it!
4,JCPennyy,"this is a fantastic app but i would recommend a couple things 1. in the images of the products, it would be beneficial to have an additional image of the full nutrition label that‚Äôs on the back of packaging. 2. on the area where it talks about the sugar content, it should be specified whether it‚Äôs added or natural sugar. one bar lost points for it being too much sugar, but it was all from fruit.  the app is great already but those would make it perfect!"
3,Rachel Bishop,"So far this app rules, however, it crashes every time I open it. After one or two scans, it crashes. I have the premium version, so I don‚Äôt want to just give up on it, but the crashing is pretty annoying."
1,solideogloriax,"Maybe the company should start including the actual ingredients list with their ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù rating, they‚Äôre recommending products known to have legitimate chemicals in their products over non toxic or cleaner options. They‚Äôre stating they don‚Äôt get paid but there‚Äôs an inconsistency with your recommendation and the actual organic product. Maybe not based on health recommendations within the USA, foreign company."
5,NaNaB 1,Absolutely Brilliant Kids!!!    Oh the stuff people are feeding their Children!!!    Thank you for showing me a way to pick the best healthy choices.   I‚Äôm so Proud of you!!!   I‚Äôm 71 and if I can be of any help feel free to contact me.   Debbie B AKA NaNaB South Carolina.
5,swing surf,It‚Äôs a nice app but I don‚Äôt like the fact that you have to be a member or whatever to search products over it‚Äôs pretty good though.
5,Michaeljcx,This app is everything to me. I started to have some health problems and i knew a little but about nutrition. This app makes understanding ingredients so easy
5,east bay greek,"I am glad to have found this ap. After buying 3 sun screen tubs, and then checking the contents, I trashed them. It is amazing how the labels misleads. Thank you for this ingenious ap. Continued success"
5,All Geeen,So glade this app was recommended it is a life changer. Go through your products to really see what your using and putting in your body.
2,???I dknt m ke,"So I was loving being able to use the free scanner, which made everything seem legit, but when I paid for it, and was able to search products, you would get multiple different scores with the same product! I don't trust it now."
5,Angelfromokc,Update- now it‚Äôs working!   Can‚Äôt get past the login. Tells me e-mail isn‚Äôt valid. I tried two and got the same thing.
5,Tudaisey,Great app. I love shopping in Sephora and scanning all the products instead of having to painstakingly look up every individual ingredient to see if it‚Äôs ok.  I hope they continually add more products.
1,Jurassyworld123,"You can not rank a product based on having an organic label. I know for a fact that organic products still get sprayed with chemical pesticides. Also, they typically have more pesticides sprayed on them versus conventional agriculture, therefore, organic requires even more work and is no better than conventional agriculture. Please do your homework first because you are misleading a lot of people."
5,Laney's Outpost,"Someone mentioned this app on an IG post, so I downloaded it and am very excited how it is now helping me buy safe food/personal hygiene products.  Thank you so much for developing such a powerful tool."
5,Rayannb,I have never written a review or have fallen in love with a app so quickly! This app is complete genius. I feel luxurious to have access to this knowledge so quickly and easily. Thank you Yuka!! What a great idea!! üòç
5,Slavea,I really just use this app to avoid the harmful additives and love how easy it is to use! I was shocked at how so many of the foods we ate contain so many actual harmful additives and am so happy we can use this app!
5,Dahafla,"This is a very good and everyone should be using it. One recommendation which would be useful for me and muslims is a halal indicator or an indicator that there is no pork gelatin. Otherwise, the app is very good and helps me make a lot of good decisions."
5,CherryBomb5,Omg My daughter told me about this app and I have been scanning everything in my home!! I am blown away and will recommend to EVERYONE!!! It‚Äôs so important to me what I‚Äôm putting in mine and my family‚Äôs body!! This app is LIFE CHANGING!!!! üôèüèº
5,MissSweetThang,"This app is AMAZING!! Everyone should get this app it makes shopping so much easier and helps me understand ingredients in our food, drinks and cosmetics! Best app hands down! Thank you Yuka!"
5,Jenniferüåæ,I am absolutely impressed! I wish I would have found this app a lot sooner! Now I can make better food choices for my family..
5,alix2710,Completely changed what I bought and used after this app. I feel 100% better. Hope they add OTC meds soob
5,Ricksaw,I love this app and I trust it. The FDA has bern allowing awful poisons into the American food. Yuka helps me find them and not pick those foods or shampoos and soaps.  However I wish it could help me with my alcohol choices.
2,Another app store user,"I scanned products from Germany and the recommended alternatives are all from the US. That's incongruous.  Digging into the reasons for the ratings, I found inconsistencies in both the data and how the data map to the ratings.  Many products were simply not found. I was invited each time to provide information about the product, but there was too much input required at once. It wasn't possible to just upload an image and then add details later.  I tried to like it for a while but eventually gave up and uninstalled."
5,JR-Stebbins,This is by far the most useful and easy application I have ever used. The great information has changed the way I shop for groceries.
5,lilili176353,This app give a lot of information without any pay and if you want pay you can choose how much I love this app
5,Beej67,"This is simply amazing! I like to it healthy and things I thought were, are not! Makes me sad, but happy to know what is or isn‚Äôt good for me and my family!"
3,Applebottom Shoppizzilla,"I got a new phone, and had to log back in. However, the app doesn‚Äôt recognize a regular log in, it‚Äôs asking me to sign up when I already paid for a year. It‚Äôs been 2 months and I can‚Äôt use what I paid for!"
1,Jules&Maximus,"It is super easy to use, but after doing my own research, the app is inconsistent, and takes chemicals out of context. There is one face moisturizer that I use that was marked poor. After reading, one of the chemicals it flagged was being harmful in aerosols, but it wasn‚Äôt, so that didn‚Äôt seem fair. And reading the work they cited, it actually said it was inconclusive. Recommend INCI detector instead."
5,Benny Patterson,I cannot recommend this app enough. I don‚Äôt go to the store without it open. Tell everyone you know about it. It will save your life
5,JACOBMUMp,It‚Äôs so hard to know what‚Äôs going in and on your body these days. I use this app regularly to protect me and my family. I also find it fun!
5,hunter69u,"This is a great app hands down. Literally will not buy half the stuff I used to buy. Knowing what is REALLY in my shampoo, lotion, food, etc, changed my whole outlook on health."
5,britteva,Please start rating household cleaning products as well!! There are so many toxins in laundry and cleaning items and with all of the greenwashed brands and it‚Äôs hard to know what to avoid.
5,Sarahann_h,I try to be very health conscious and this app has made it so much easier to make healthy decisions. I now recommend it to people all the time!
5,chris20045,In a day and age where consumers are constantly misled about what they're purchasing this app makes it so easy to understand what you're buying. So awesome!
5,J_trap,Love how easy this app is to use. Just scan and  all the information comes up. Can‚Äôt believe how deceiving product labels are. I‚Äôve learned so  much. Thank you
3,lokahyna,I honestly really love this app. It has helped me and my family purchase healthier items for our household. There is one thing that is very misleading. Some of the products I have scanned say that sodium benzoate is a hazardous additive but other products say sodium benzoate has no risk. So which is it? Hazardous or no Risk? ü§î
4,Alexis Rose Shell,"It‚Äôs a really good app! It‚Äôs free, I like it! I scan mostly beauty products to see what is healthy for my hair, skin, nails, and I use it for which foods are healthy for you. I just wish that more products was added, such as fingernails polish and more."
5,phycar,Really great to have when trying to make good healthy choices at the grocery store.. I‚Äôve had several family members download the app as well..
5,ghost_god,I have been using it for over a year and invited a bunch of friends. Many of family and friends are interested in using it in India.   Excellent app.
5,Coribabyy,Gives you great information on products. Helped me from buying so many products I thought were healthy!
5,j-lynn40,My friend had me download this app. It saved my life‚Ä¶ seriously now I‚Äôm going thru the stores and scanning everythingüòä love love love this app I recommend it to anyone s as nd everyone!!
1,Sebastivn,"I think this app is a sham when it comes to rating your own food. The recommendations show options that are supposed to be better but when I compare the two, it turns out that the product I‚Äôm eating is beyond better. Some examples are the protein plus shakes and the snyders pretzels; the recommendations are not at all better but rated higher. Makes sense."
5,Ffffdssvbhhtr,I love what you guys are doing! I showed you guys support on my page trying to get everyone to download it and raise awareness of what we are eating in our food these days.
5,Morgan1200,So quick and easy to use while shopping and saves time instead of reading labels throughout the store.
5,GRANDMA MINGY,Just started using this APP from a friends suggestion and I‚Äôm loving it. Highly suggest all my friends to use it that are serious about products.
5,Dulcedulce,"Since I discovered this app, I have not stop using it. It makes me feel confident about the products I buy from the supermarket."
3,BBeam,I love this app with one exception: there needs to be a verified checkmark for products. I‚Äôve seen the same products uploaded by users with completely opposite ratings and then don‚Äôt know which is correct and then feel I can‚Äôt trust it.
5,Texas üíï,I‚Äôve eliminated toxic ‚Äúbeauty products‚Äù & made much better choices thanks to this app. I‚Äôve shared this app with multiple people in grocery stores and with my friends.
2,Parker Kelli,When I found Yuka I was so excited.. finally an app that rates food like Think Dirty rates self care & cleaning products. For the most part Yuka was pretty great until I noticed Yuka deemed a lot of products that contained seed oils such as canola oil as healthy. I‚Äôve now switched to the Trash Panda app & Bobby approved app to scan my products. They are aware of how unhealthy & inflammatory seed oils are & rate accordingly.
1,cherryblunt,"tbh, I don't know if I fully trust this app because whoever makes it can put it in there that all of the ingredients are bad yet not follow up from where they got their sources from. then on another app the product i just scanned is fine? and then the fact that the description of how bad everything is, is full of typos and some sentences make literal no sense. id say not worth it!"
5,P-Detty,"I cannot believe how much I‚Äôve learned since using this app!  Sadly, many brands that I loved and trusted, are just unhealthy foods, sold in healthy-appearing packaging!  This app is a true game-changer!"
5,xvrgsjx,This app has been so helpful in finding additives in products. My child has allergies to dyes and artificial sweeteners and this app has been perfect in breaking down additives.  Thank you
5,DJmanny2016,This app deserves 100 stars. It is so simple and extremely helpful and informational. I cannot stress how simple and efficient it is. The developers of this app got it right! This is so incredible.
5,Ilyayef,"This App will change your life for the better, start eating right and using products that help you stay healthy!"
5,Kenobi's Fire,"It‚Äôs crazy seeing how many products can cause cancer. We now know what to shop for. I love how it gives us recommendations to replace bad products, this app is a literal life saver."
5,4sistas,"Great app, easy to use and very informative. I don‚Äôt want to pay a yearly subscription but if developers want to charge a one time fee I would/will be happy to pay."
5,manon_anna_,I use this app everyday when I go get my groceries and I love it! I also have the premium version which is perfect when you don‚Äôt have signal! I highly recommend this app!!
3,honestyIsKey561,App works great and seems to want to be helpful. It doesn‚Äôt include all ingredients in products especially  the ones it promotes as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù. A simple search and comparison will prove that as that is how I found out. Don‚Äôt buy things 100% based on what it says. Very misleading‚Ä¶
5,lavarocked,So far so good RFK got me asking questions. We‚Äôve thrown away a bunch of poison and we‚Äôre hoping to make heather choices. This is a big step forward Yuka onwards
5,squldthekld,I love this app! It‚Äôs helped my journey to cut out additives and processed foods tremendously. It‚Äôs so informational and I love the new ‚Äúcall out‚Äù button to inform the major brands of the junk they are adding. Thank you Yuka!
5,dioraqz,Ever since being pregnant i wanted to consume everything healthy and thank god for yuka bc nowadays there‚Äôs so many bad products trying to harm us and i now shop in peace knowing what‚Äôs best
5,clc434,I‚Äôve recently started an effort to swap out my products across my household to make them all safer. This app is such a time saver. I‚Äôm so grateful for it! Best money I‚Äôve ever spent on an app.
5,puppycat_tay,I‚Äôm obsessed. Scanning everything. So surprising to see all the additives. Helps me make better choices about what I put in my body. Especially living in the USA.
5,"10-937928/&8,7?:&","I‚Äôll reduce the 1,000 words I could say to this‚Ä¶.my only regret, is that I didn‚Äôt have this app sooner in my life."
5,Teenab8,I love love love this app and makes finding better food easier. I hate this app because it shows how little our gvmt cares about the health it‚Äôs people
5,NanJay92,"Just wish there was a way to add specific lists- say, one for TJ‚Äôs, another for Costco, etc. instead of relying on the star feature."
5,Viki.madcrafters,"I was reading and looking up words I had no idea what they were. This app is amazing, saving me lots of time spent shopping for the healthier options!"
5,EliUnr,I‚Äôm so excited about this app! Very informative and eye- opening. There is an epidemic in the US of straight poisoning of our everyday foods by our food manufacturers. Help your family alleviate toxins from their diet‚Ä¶ FOR FREE! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,wjennis3,This is an excellent multi-faceted resource for evaluating how loaded a food or cosmetic choice is with hazardous chemicals.  I‚Äôve used this app multiple times a week and recommended it to numerous colleagues.  5 Stars!!
4,sophielovespeanut,I loved this app but while showing my friends in school they were messing around with it and now my account is locked üòï I would still very much recommend this app!
5,MadelynR523,Only wish our elders could have had access to this information
5,Wunderu,Love this app. Scan everything now and grocery shopping takes a little longer but it‚Äôs worth it!
1,Nsnskdkd,"I was happy with the free version, then I paid the anual subscription  and  couldn‚Äôt use the app in the stores anymore.  It always says that It can‚Äôt connect.  My husband has the free version and doesn‚Äôt have problems in the same place where I do have the problem.  What was I thinking when I paid?"
3,Jpjohnp,This app is awesome in a lot of ways but it does not let you know about things like hydrogenated oils or other trans fats. They take total saturated fat into account but with the help risks of trans fats specifically it would be great if the app showed those as well.
2,girlreview2022,It was suggesting bad brands to replace some things I know are healthier! It doesn‚Äôt take every ingredient into account - be careful with this and do your own research  I don‚Äôt know who created this app but they didn‚Äôt do they‚Äôre homework or they‚Äôre standing behind brands to sell their own products!
5,lolilikilhsjdbdjd,Keeps me knowing what‚Äôs healthy and not and I‚Äôm just a kid like this would be so useful if adults want to go on a diet and whoever made this please read this and also your the best
5,mama who cares,This app has been an amazing tool for helping to not have hazardous items in our home. My whole family is using this app now!!!
2,sTitCh63946283,"This is horrible. My health teacher recommended this for ‚Äúbetter eating habits‚Äù and I scanned almost everything around the house. If I followed this my diet would consist of bread, peanut butter, salsa, pasta, prego sauce, eggs, and milk. The bad things for you are jam, cheese, (pizza rolls are better than cheese when it has cheese in it) ketchup, most sauces, pickles, orange juice, mayo, sour cream, lemon and lime juice, crackers, etc."
5,amanda2796,"In a world where our government does not care about our wellbeing, this app is an incredible resource to help educate us on what‚Äôs best and worst! Food, skin care, anything you use day to day."
1,Aikomama420,I was excited to try this app but it requires you to create an account before you can use it. I entered my email address and info and get the error ‚Äúemail Seems invalid‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried my work email and 2 other email address and it won‚Äôt take any of them. Deleting since I‚Äôm unable to gain access to the app
4,newfoundlandlover10,I tried with multiple different emails and they were all ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù I went with a different app that‚Äôs similar and glad I did it ‚Äúthink dirty‚Äù is way better
5,222FY,The app has really helped making choices at the grocery store. It has really help my husband and I make healthier choices. We love it!
2,KMT5,I scanned my beauty products and then cross checked the ‚Äúbad‚Äù ingredients with Beautypedia‚Äôs new ingredient checker and I only found one actual bad ingredient in the toothpaste I was using.   The apps scan function is easy to use but you may need to do your own research on each ingredient or product to get the full picture.
5,shesprag,This is the best App Ever. Changing my life every time I go shopping. I have went threw my cabinets and scanned everything. I have been telling all my friends & Family. Thanks!
2,lollygag45,"Based on the reviews I went ahead and paid for a premium subscription so that I could search in addition to scanning items. Total bust. Very disorganized. Many of the same products showing up with different ratings. I don‚Äôt know where these good reviews came from. Anyway, I‚Äôd like my money back."
1,lutherdogevil333,"My kids eat some non healthy foods and I downloaded to see what ingredients are in them, and my kids are not the thinnest kids ever but they are self-Conscious about their weight and this app made them not eat for 7 days to lose weight. We had to bring them to the hospital for their fasting. Please do not use this app if you are self-conscious."
5,MOSANDI,I love how easy to use and informational this app has been. I have made changes to my diet and what I use on my body and in my house based off the factual information from this app! Love love love!
5,Doova636,Honestly there‚Äôs so much garbage in our food that we don‚Äôt know about and this app really helps bring it to light. Highly recommend
5,BeanerNnewbiE,I am thankful for this app. It is eye opening and much needed. I have been trying to tell all of my friends about this app. Please keep doing what you are doing. Thank you.
5,pearl_girl_usa,Really like how easy it is to contact the brands and ask them to remove certain additives!
5,Alllnicknames are taken,As a dietitian and personal trainer I love this app. Very friendly and useful to everybody not just pushing what products they want but giving better options and explaining why. Love it
5,ll7651,Best app ever!!! How did I go so long without using it and WHY? Never again! Obsessed w this app and have been getting everyone in my life to use it too!!!üíìüíì
1,Moonfemme,"As someone who was way ahead of this curve i was so excited to see an app like this. Sadly, if you use this YOU WILL GET SICK AND DEVELOP DISEASE.  An app that recommends synthetic sugars(sugar free).. No!!!! It scores everything poorly that contains 1g or sugar or salt.  Your body needs salt! Have the developers lost their mind! I can‚Äôt wait to see a lawsuit!!! BEWARE PLEASE!!!! Delete this app off your phone! GIVE YOURSELF 3-5yrs  and you‚Äôll regret it‚Äôs advice.  T O X I X !!! Wake Up!!!!!!"
5,ChrisMenez,"Low price, simple to use app, even has offline mode which is great! Never change the price and simple concept!"
5,Jen the Hair Queen,This app blew up my life for a little while lol but honestly BEST APP I have!!!! I have already been changing my food life and this just allowed me to take it next level!!! I am grateful!!!
4,Hallsway,Scanning everything. Cracked my brain open to new thinking. Would like suggestions to be something in my area so I could make better decisions and purchases.
3,Single Black Man,Some of the information is incorrect. These things need to be double checked before releasing to the public. Wrong information could lead to someone choosing/spreading the wrong information
5,My name is cam.,This app is so useful that it‚Äôs a no brained to use this everywhere I go. Knowing what you‚Äôre ingesting is important you are what you eat. Thank you Yuka for this app and all it has done for my diet.
2,dfiske,Not great for identifying foods with seed oils. Suggest the developer adds this to your rating of foods. It‚Äôs important. Also some foods have great ingredients but are high in calories and you mark them down. Is this a weight loss app or a food quality app? Suggest you are clear with what you are presenting to the consumer.
5,Minnie Golfer,"This app really helps me determine products that are either good for me or not. With this knowledge, I can eliminate the products that are bad."
3,Luvnothate,the app itself is perfectly fine. no problems or anything. i just really don‚Äôt like the fact on it‚Äôs ratings. i have a lot of worrying. so when i scan something it makes me scared to buy it because of it saying ‚Äúit might clog my lymph nodes‚Äù or something like that. it‚Äôs really a great app for telling u certain ingredients to watch out for but don‚Äôt let it control what u buy. if u love a product don‚Äôt let yuka tell u it‚Äôs a 0/100 for what ever the reason is and have u not buy it
5,SWIFTIE4EVER1313,I almost ate something that messed with my kidneys. I am so glad I have this app installed. Best app I have ever gotten. Also this helps with being aware of what you are eating. This app is VERY suggested by me.
5,AuntGus,"This app is so amazing on so many levels! Simple and easy to use, yet it delivers such valuable information concisely and instantly. Perfect! Thank you SO much!! I‚Äôm telling EVERYBODY about this!!"
5,Richie_A,"So glad I discovered this app. I testify everywhere that people download it. Game changer in finding quality  and really knowing what‚Äôs good off the shelf, past the price and name."
5,JenEscobar89,"Based on actual research and science, this app has helped me learn so much about what we put in and on our bodies. I pay for the premium membership and its totally worth it!"
5,Romina_4264,What an amazing app it truly helps me see what is in everyday products that people know and love!! And it has surprised me I‚Äôve definitely stopped using harmful products thanks to Yuka!
5,Tab1234567789,"Thank you for making this app.   All these lotions I was putting on myself and family üò±üò± with ingredients that can cause infertility and endocrine issues. Among many other issues.   My products shopping has definitely been reduced   This is a lifestyle change. People, it‚Äôs time to wake up and stand up to big corps. Demand better products for our families! Look at the fertility rates plummeting‚Äî cancer rates soaring‚Äî 1+1=2"
5,Yoooo Dude,Has totally changed the way we purchase many items we use daily! Great informative information!
5,lissnow7,I love how I can scan items and not have to read lots of long ingredient labels. It rates and then gives alternatives for unhealthy items.
5,ConsciousJora,"This app is extremely useful, especially in the modern age where the contents of food is often containing chemicals and additives that are extremely toxic to our physical and mental health. Thank you YUKA!!!"
5,ffshelenasinmycccup,Thank you for making this a one stop shop to see which products are more harm than good.üíñ
5,ConElk,"Since this app was shared with me 2 weeks ago, I‚Äôve shared it with at least 10 people. We all love that we can now chose the best/safest products. I love it!"
5,Muakismuakin,Please just download it. Keep your family and self healthy. Scan away and make decisions wether to buy/consume it or not. You wont regret itüå∏
4,Kthom1056789,I wish it took in to account inflammatory oils and dyes. Some of the scores I don‚Äôt agree with but I love what they are doing and trying. I think this will help a lot of Americans!
5,dvrlinda,"I have desperately been needing this app. Some skin products I spend high bucks on, I now know are not healthy products. As far as food products, yay! I will be using this app every time I go shopping. ü•∞"
4,"12344&/!,&",I love this app but I went back to look at something I bought. The score was incredibly lower than I remember. I bought the product and I wouldn‚Äôt have if I knew it scored in the bad range.
5,Nattie Rebecca,"It‚Äôs amazing the way they alert you about the bad stuff in your comestics and groceries, I‚Äôm soooo grateful to found it, extremely happy and content with the results!! YUKA APP ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèº"
5,we ffghhhhgff,Fast and has saved me from making bad decisions about my diet. Works better than advertised!
5,Long Time Banker 9,This app completely changed the way the kids & I eat. Surprisingly the cheaper no name brands are better for you than name brands. Saved me $ too.
4,a woman who cares,Love the app only dislike is that Talc is not listed as bad. Watch the documentary ‚ÄúNot so pretty‚Äù its almost impossible to get asbestos out of talc as they naturally occur in the earth together and even small amount are extremely damaging to the body.
5,bcsb22,"This is seriously life changing! Eating healthy can be difficult when we have so many options on our hands, but this app truly makes it easy!"
5,Jocie28,This has been fabulous. I love looking at products and finding out the details. I enjoy the suggestions too.
5,Yolie9,"This app is a life saver. I have passed it on to many friends. It breaks down good from bad, and allows me to buy healthy foods. Thank you for this app, hats off to the developers and all whom is involved. Thank you l, Yolanda Hoo"
3,1luv1luv,"Scanned same foundation in two different colors, the back lists all same ingredients. One came up as excellent the other as poor. Either the ingredients are being entered wrong/incomplete by mistake, or on purpose, but either way - be mindful."
5,Rockinroxy1r,This app has been very helpful to my health and lifestyle change. It even shows the time ingredients in products not just food.
5,TAHIAFILASTEEN,"Love this app to increase awareness about food, cosmetics, cleaning products and the hidden impacts they have on us. Use this every single day with new products I am considering."
5,starimpulse,"I‚Äôm in a journey, learning about how food and cosmetics can affect our body, and this app is being the greatest help ever !!! I‚Äôm so happy that I discovered it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è thanks YUKA TEAM, for make it  happen üëè"
5,LuzMgC,I am so grateful that I got this app by the recommendation of my brother. It helps to take conscious decisions about consuming any product and food. Big shout out to the creators.
1,Marybeth Strauss,"I‚Äôm am furious at this application I installed in this phone. It has prohibited thou from entering thy Yuka app. I was pondering about the nutritional dangers of eating cards and noticed there weren‚Äôt any facts about them, so I filled the information list for them. 16 hours later I reopened the Yuka on my apple iPhone 6 pro it said that I was expelled from the yuka application. IM AM VERY FRUSTRATED AND WOULD WISH TO BE ADDED BACK TO THE YUKA."
4,A MitchRod,"I‚Äôm so thankful for this app, I literally use it everywhere I go, I highly recommend everyone using it!!! Food and beverage companies use very deceptive advertising, so again, this app has been very helpful."
5,my sunshine on a cloudy day,I thought my grocery selections in the past were healthy‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been set straight now with the help of the yuca app‚Ä¶love the helpful tool! Very easy to navigate.
2,Sly1one,Im not impressed with their scoring and review outcomes.   They recommended walmart great value beef jerky sticks with additives over chomps grass-fed jerky sticks for no reason other than sat-fat per mg. I just cant take that recommendation seriously. Not to mention they utilize the same government agencies and or big players that have proven themselves insane since 2020 as a standard for their scoring model.
5,kk$&,"Thank you so much for putting this app together, it has been instrumental in helping my family make healthy purchases"
5,ElectricMango,"Very good app. Please though, enable the Ultra-Wide / Macro lens for the iPhone pro models. I have to hold products very far from my phone for focus to work, vs being able to focus close up"
5,Jelly beans rock,Love this app. It has helped me understand products and how bad I was eating. I always scan products before I buy them now.
5,Gdog55001,"I can‚Äôt stop. Every time I open them app I binge scan the household. Butter, bananas, tanning lotion, you name it. I love the subscription model idea."
5,Spank70,"I too, have scanned everything in my home. It‚Äôs amazing some of the things, you thought were healthy. Turned out to be unhealthy. Love this app!!!"
5,just 1 man,Please download this app if you want to live all the things you thought was healthy is a lie I recommend this app to anyone start living healthier
5,Pres.vw,"I normally don‚Äôt write a review, but I love this app. As someone with Celiac and other dietary issues, this app is a game changer!! I try and be so careful with what I eat and put on my skin, so Yuka is quite handy. 10/10!"
5,lbk23,"Extremely useful, I had no idea about the poor quality of some of the products I used to eat or drink. Let‚Äôs hope it will force the manufacturers to lower sugar, salt and additives."
2,Mo_Tyme,"At first l loved the app, but then it became misleading. There are some  items listed  twice, one is rated as good and the other rated  poor.  The items contains the same exact photo and name . Also when scanning some items listed as excellent then change a week later to poor. Be careful with trusting this app"
5,M Miche,My family loves this app! It is impartial and factual and informative with great alternative product suggestions! It is very detailed as well to help educate you on your way to a healthier lifestyle üôåüòçüëçüèº
5,masha31110,"love this app, love telling people about it and just sharing it in general! it's not only good for skin care products but also for snacks for you and your kids!"
5,Jh12345fu,I wish I would have had this years ago.  The amount of toxins in food in America is insane.  YuKa is doing an amazing service.  Keep up the good work!!
5,papaMiller,But it seems that the majority of food products I scan comes up bad for one reason or another.   What‚Äôs a human to eat.
5,MNBrad,"No idea how this is free but it‚Äôs absolutely amazing.  I‚Äôm addixted to it and shop with it.  I‚Äôve learned so much, like brands I thought were great and are poor and vice versa.  Outstanding app.  Thank you."
5,coasting2,Love the scan product function and given recommended/better food choices.
5,Ad shrug,"Easy to use, huge database of products, info everyone needs to know. Affects the food my family consumes regularly! Grateful for tech because of apps like this."
5,Junibee,This app places control of our health in our hands.  Scan the barcode for the real truth behind the marketing hype of our food. üëèüëèüëè
5,Rockhell73,I LOVE this app!! It makes it so easy to be able to see what you‚Äôre really eating and whether it is good or bad AND why!! The positive and negative section is my favorite!!
5,Nipsey1111,Really love this application. The truth will set you free. Wish I could donate whenever possible. So everyone can have the upgraded version.
5,boooooobbbbbbbbbbbbb,"Works wonderful for beauty, cosmetics, hygiene, and food! I however do wish they would add food dyes in to their ratings but other than that the app is wonderful!"
4,Flady20,"They advise to buy their recommended products which is great but no one ever heard from them and no store sell them! So, it‚Äôs not helpful‚Ä¶"
5,bchinault,Really helped me reconsider a lot of products I buy. Surprised that a lot of the cheaper options were safer than expensive ones.
5,oKc mission,"Hopefully these results are true, and it‚Äôs sad to say that so many food items are poor, bad food choices.."
5,Cameron7777777777777,Money well spent on this informative app. Already have many family members downloading as well! Keep up the good work!
5,nikkilauren,My eyes have been wide open to what I eat ever since discovering this app! I love being more knowledgeable about what I am eating.
5,ghdvydbhdnufb,Genuinely needed for anyone looking to know what‚Äôs actually in their food without the hassle of reading every label.
5,kiarash qp,"I just downloaded this application despite its convenience, and usefulness, ITS FREE!!! And an other eye catching features of this application is its high details about products  I loved it"
1,Megrg90,"After hearing good reviews of this app, I decided to give it a try. However, it will not allow me to create an account. I keep getting told the email address is invalid. I have used several email addresses and none will work. Also had no way to report the issue so unfortunately, this is how I had to do it."
5,123AppsbyAvery,I love this app but i recently became a member not sure how to stop it from going offline mode and it crashes a lot on my phone I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me or the app
4,Hgcjppydehhjoo,"This app is amazing for identifying harmful additives. I use it when shopping every time‚Ä¶ the nutritional ratings, however, are somewhat questionable‚Ä¶ seed oils are toxic as anything and are marked good‚Ä¶ again, I use every time I shop for additives but that‚Äôs it."
5,Mie kaw,"It‚Äôs a must have when doing grocery. We realize that we are surrounded by tons of trash food disguised as healthy, but totally poisonous for us."
3,Chaotrope2,"I think this is generally a good app, but be aware of embedded assumptions, such as fortification is considered a negative and results in a red dot. I also found it interesting that suggested options for an organic product were all non-organic. Which is very insightful, but perhaps of limited use of one is committed to organic foods."
5,JohhnyQ58,This app slows me to see all the ingredients and explanations of what the chemical additives actually are. This allows me to make informed buying decisions. I won‚Äôt shop without it
5,Am3doure,"Very useful app, especially with shopping with kids. I‚Äôll let them choose in the snacks they want as long as it passes the Yuka test :)"
5,Jmone5,"Horrified by what I‚Äôve found in the products I‚Äôve been using for YEARS, thankful I have this app to guide me in the right direction moving forward."
1,Notsonosey,"This app injects their liberal political viewpoints into opinions on products, and that is a disrespectful behavior. Scan Donald Trumps mints and you will see for yourself-I wonder what other products perhaps conservative owned or operated or operating in a red state they might manipulate the findings on???? Liberal garbage!!!!!!!!! Delete!  Update: they responded with a generic response denying the facts, so they are liars to! I will post a screenshot of the review to prove it!"
1,Yoshi_W,This app is spreading so much false and misinformation for example the products containing parabens are rated low because they supposedly cause cancer. Parabens aren‚Äôt not dangerous nor do they cause cancer do some scientific research and look at recent studies not just some news article. this app definitely has an agenda and they don‚Äôt want us to find it.
3,thisgameloopsglitch,"I love this app, but i really wish there was a way to turn off some of the flags like ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù and ‚Äútoo high in sugar‚Äù. I‚Äôm recently recovering from an eating disorder and i love this to watch for harmful additives, but the caloric warnings are not needed for most of the foods they are on (ie. grahm crackers)"
5,Gilly the barber,What an amazing app. Thank you to the developers. I love apps and people like this because what they‚Äôre doing is giving their gift to the world. Amazing amazing amazing. Very grateful for finding this app?
1,WillMcAvoy777,"There are certain parameters that these people do not take into account with products. They rate a baby wipe excellent but don‚Äôt take into account the fabric used. A lot of the fabric used in baby wipes is made in a very dirty chemical process. Obviously these chemicals will get into your body, regardless of what liquid is used in the wipe. I cannot trust this company until they change their practices."
5,Sahil@55,Really helpful to check quality products
5,M‚Äôim‚Äôi,It is an amazing app that helps you choose a better product when buying. 100% recommended
5,Nw1978,This app has changed my life! I have looked up all my products and the ones that are not good or excellent I threw out! Thank you
5,grisscessar,Application is very helpful when you want to know the quality of the product
5,Devogirl,I scan everything I buy now.  It‚Äôs so informative!! Truly scary what crap is in our food and beauty products. Thank you!!! I love this app!!!
5,CovertOps007,I really like the simplicity but powerful insights we are getting. The recommendations could use some improvement but it works nonetheless.
5,yoinkthenuts,"Yuka is definitely the best app I have on my phone at the moment, just practical in every way, I love you for creating this"
5,keikei_ya,They already fix the bug in the last update which is awesome!! thanks for that ü•∞
1,vongeric0,"This app is so inaccurate, many chemists said this is a NONO. Even the producers of this app did not clarify that they RESEARCHED properly. I do not recommend. It makes you throw out stuff. Even though there are some ingredients that irritate your skin, IT IS PERFECTLY FINE. What this app wants you to use is CLEAN CLEAN products. IT IS NORMAL TO USE IRRITANT PRODUCTS, IT IS IS GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN. Please go to a DERMATOLOGIST ASAP FOR MORE INFO. I repeat, please don‚Äôt use this app even if it‚Äôs for food!!"
5,Mysterre,The best part about this app is the harmful additives that you don‚Äôt see in plain language on the packaging.
5,nebdikebshd,This app is quite literally a life saver! Giving the consumer knowledge and control over what goes in and on our bodies.
5,Stanwix98!,Thank you so much for creating this Yuka!!! My eyes are now open and you can not unsee the information! I‚Äôm telling everyone to download this App!!
5,honeybabe7712,My jaw is dropped. So many foods I was eating thinking they were healthy!!! This app is incredible l. They also give you substitute recommendations! If I could give this app more than 5 stars I would!!
3,Stef3827,"Good idea but bad for diabetics. There‚Äôs no option (yet) to personalize for 0-sugar and 0-low carbohydrate foods. Our household has been 0-low sugar, 0-low carbohydrate, high protein for 30yrs and recently incorporated high healthy fats. This app would be better when they can add in these dietary options."
2,Salahidin,"This app reassures you from the false fears it creates. False fears because the poison is not in the substance itself by in the quantity (toxicology 101). Yet the mere presence of a substance suspected of having negative effects on the human body, appears in red. Imposture also because this app is clearly violating antitrust laws. Anyway, enjoy life while it last, and don‚Äôt get distracted by fearmongers."
5,Nickels791,I thought all of my products were good and clean but it turns out that they weren‚Äôt thanks to this app I found out
4,Enthuist,Unfortunately I was told by support the premium version is not available in the US. IN addition I wish it included Cholesterol and some other ingredients that it currently support.
5,--Julia2--,Finally an app to let people know whether or not there are toxic chemicals in a product or food. I‚Äôm telling everyone about it! Thank you team Yuka! You guys are the best !!!!
5,Una angel de Dios,I love how easy to use. This app help me so much to get healthy food for my family. Thank you üòä for the person that makes this app.
5,Genaroop,This app has helped me choose better products.  It‚Äôs always better to invest in our health than our sickness.  Thank you!!!
2,TaylorAnn96,"The rating it gives is unusual because an item will lose points for being too caloric or too fruit sugar sweet when it has no added sugar. I don‚Äôt mind sweet fruit or caloric foods. I‚Äôm more concerned about cancerous, harmful additives, pesticides, added sugar, and hazardous ingredients. But most items did show up with the scanner."
5,YoungManOldBody,The power to improve your health thru your diet is now in your hands.   Thank you for developing this app.    Your health is your wealth.   Start here.
5,DevilPup47,"Wow!  App is so friendly userer.  Easy to scan, data entry, photo capture, etc. It even let you add item that the app does not recognize."
5,Kathy432,Really helps eliminate toxic chemicals from your body inside and out.   I‚Äôve gone organic and now this app makes my life easier and healthier.
5,JGreer2013review,Very helpful when deciding which brands to buy. The side-by-side recommendations are genius. Leads you to eating more healthy products.
5,A#1bigfan01,"I love the app, I have learned tons and love scanning things around the house or grocery store! Only thing I could ever ask for, is to add carbohydrates to the facts, for the low carb dieters!"
5,Dhndjnjd,Especially  if you ‚Äò re indecisive about the healthiest product on the shelf. Plus Yuka goes the extra mile and provides healthier and comparable products to choose.
5,cojeleb,I always have questions when I buy a product at the supermarket about whether or not it's good. This app does the job for me! Bravo et merci
5,Samiradbeltt,I love this app!! I‚Äôm not a reviewer person but I actually wanna take the time with this one.  It just makes everything easier and honest
5,letmebeda1,Thank you so much for your hard work with this app. So easy to use and so helpful to make better choices.
5,keaishdha,Should allow more features for basic version though.
3,bar'ker,I was disappointed that products packaged in plastic containers were rated higher than some of my favorites that I choose for the glass. I think plastic containers are not as healthy for me or the environment. I understand that this is not currently within the scope of your app.
5,grefee,you just scan the barcode of a food item or anything really and shows you if it is good. Msg or gmo and all
1,Boboggins,This app is specifically designed to push products that advertise on their app.  I would believe their review of the products if the app didn‚Äôt give you recommendations below.  It is so obvious that the app makes money pushing the recommended items below.  The app has different scales for different products and is a fraud.
5,mmmmgggggvvvv,"For general people it is not easy to read ingredients, but this app explain each ingredient si you can avoid those that are bad."
5,Jeanie4now,I have gone through my entire pantry and now I know what I need to keep and what is junk! I can‚Äôt wait to go to the grocery store now!
5,Laura0620,Finally a transparent food database app that isn‚Äôt paid off by big food corps to lie to us about how toxic their additives are. Thank you to whoever developed this!
5,Tajji Z,"This app is honestly amazing. It‚Äôs easy to use, works really well, and keeps surprising me with how good it is. Definitely one of the best I‚Äôve come across!"
5,DannySoi6,Amazing idea.. i hope this can make people choose better and inspire companies to make more healthy products
4,Sandy12308,"Hi , this app very helpful and support to check all items. Kids also using this app to learn each product before use the product. Thank you so much"
5,Fannnyyyyyyyyyyyyy69,I was hoping for an app to tell me what‚Äôs in my food products and they‚Äôve created an AMAZING one. 5/5 fantastic app!! Really eye opening to the poisons in our foods. Stay safe y‚Äôall!
5,tmnky,"amazing app, bought a membership despite a lot of already free benefits i used daily. Got my friends into it too"
3,ü•®üçÑHelloKittyüçÑü•®,"So basically everything I buy is bad for me?! There were a couple low/medium risk ingredients and ratings go down to poor. Even my AWARD WINNING and best rated skincare products were ‚Äúpoor‚Äù for a few not so harmful ingredients, I don‚Äôt find this app helpful"
5,quadxfi,There is little sound scientific evidence linking sodium to negative health outcomes while low sodium actually is known to be problematic. I think these old myths should be removed from the app.
5,hcuucuvuyzg,Ok so this app is amazing and safely it turns out more than half the stuff in my house including food and skincare is bad. üòÇüò≠ But overall the app is amazing
5,Ahobbs314,This app is one that could go for a Nobel Prize. Mind boggling the products and foods that we put in our body‚Äôs every day. Thank you for helping me Yuka!
5,jhjutssyic,The best app ever. Everyone should be aware of what is in there food.  And this app will do it. I use it to check what I am buying every time I go shopping.
5,Qwertyasdfg√±lkjh,It is a life saver!! You don‚Äôt have to take hours reading all the ingredients every time you go shopping. And it works in different countries.
5,sk8erguy2007,I really hope this app continues to gain traction. Very valuable information and very easy interface. Please keep it ad free and unbiased. This is great work.
3,stje2020,"Overall this is a great functioning app that has a ton of potential.   Pros: Easy to use, scan function, independent and no ads, flexible subscription fee, so so many items in the database  Cons: not super clear on what makes bad vs poor vs good rating. Feels like some items have the exact same ingredients, but one is bad and other is poor. No considerations for GMOs which I think is a huge miss. I will not be renewing my membership if it‚Äôs not added by the end of the year."
5,Forever frugal,What a wonderful app to have now I  know spending more money is not always a better product!
5,Redsoxgirl503,Love this app!! It puts the power of knowledge in your hands! I love they provide healthy substitutes when you scan a product that may not have a very good rating [insert YAY!]
5,kaypie2,This app is sooooo beneficial and addicting! I use it every day to eat healthier and have also turned my Mom into a daily user also!
5,Backlot2506,This app has changed our lives. We were eating poison before this app and we thought it was healthy.
5,Roxy1531,This makes it sooo easy to shop!! We are trying to be healthier in my household and use better items. Thank you for this app!!!!
5,theobrienfamily,Love this app it makes shopping so much easier when you are looking for cleaner / no harmful products   They do the homework for you ! It‚Äôs great!
5,yum fit,Just started using this app and it is so helpful and informative. I‚Äôm learning more and more about what is actually in the food I‚Äôm eating
5,accgrpe,Didn‚Äôt realize how bad most of the products I used were until I used this app.
5,squeaky-1,"I‚Äôm not one to do this but I‚Äôm so excited to share this app with friends and family, it helps make healthy, safer choices easier."
3,HappyReviewer777,"So this app makes me feel like it‚Äôs bashing all the other tasty brands. Probably didn‚Äôt get sponsored either. I dunno. It‚Äôs a good app, but the putting down of other products.. maybe they aren‚Äôt. I just had a revelation. Forget what I said."
5,thelitunicorn,I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and I‚Äôm changing my whole lifestyle. This app has helped me do that so much!!!  We became premium members because it is truly worth it!
5,Booboolivespebs,Perfect for keeping track of my eats and beauty products and I find it so helpful that the recommendations have its own section. Wonderfully made app.
5,Allen045,I love this app! I am a blind person who uses this app to identify packages. The barcode scanner is the best I have ever seen! Please don't ever change it!
5,supergab12347679,"This app is just great. Everything about it. Calling out the brand with pre-written emails, all the literature cited and linked to do your own research. Really great"
5,Caylene580,"This app is amazing, it truly is so helpful and quick and I love the recommendations to find better food and cosmetic products! Truly so helpful!"
5,LadyBugatti,"Love this app, helps me make smarter decisions on products and food that go in or on my body!  Appreciate the hard work u did to help us"
5,Cats eat ears,It is good if you are on the go and are not sure if any thing you have in your cabinets are healthy or if products are safe and healthy for your skin:)
5,pbizzy2,What have I been eating?! This app is incredible I just can‚Äôt believe some of the ingredients that is in our food. Thanks for creating this app.
5,Real person 813,Use this app! It is the best app for your health!! Absolutely changes the way I buy food! Amazes me how many products have harmful ingredients! This app is a game changer!
3,Nonyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,Glad that it gives suggestions on alternate products but if i cannot highlight the product name to copy/search it the app feels like its half-baked. Lets get this updated so the use of the app feels completed!
3,wecbyu,"ITS AN AMAZING APP but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ i deleted it and tried signing back in with multiple accounts and it just kept saying ""email and password don‚Äôt match"" and ""entered wrong too many times"" and ""its invalid"" even though i knew for a fact it was right. I NEED HELPPPPPPP"
5,Alex#1 not a bot review,Wealth of information to inform you on what you‚Äôre putting in your body.
5,Ndkayqu&15,It‚Äôs so alarming to see all hazardous chemicals and additives in our food. Even items that say ‚Äúpreservative free!‚Äù
5,MonaFG56,Love this app it helps keep me in check and keeps me away from things that has additives! I highly recommended this app!  Must have App!!!
5,Raburt,This is exactly what America needs!! A way to find out what‚Äôs in their products before they use!
1,GLWTWO,"This app has one and only one purpose: to sell your email address and data. I used a unique email to sign up. The first item I scanned was Hint Water. Within 24 hours I got an email from Hint to that address.  I‚Äôm sure they disclosed that in the fine print that no one reads.  If the product is free, YOU are the product."
4,Directioner 1D ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,"suggestions- ‚Ä¢ always give recommendations, even for ‚Äúgood‚Äù products. just so we have the option to find better ‚Ä¢ please include an environmental impact assessment. i cannot stress enough how much more i would love this app if there was a rating for environmental impact as well ‚Ä¢ personalized recommendations or filters based on goals/needs/preferences ‚Ä¢ allow a space for users to rate/comment on products"
5,ZaylaKay,This app allows others to know what‚Äôs in their food and beauty products! I‚Äôm switching to a more natural and healthy way of living
5,Best download!,This sight has helped me make healthier choices for my dietary needs! I absolutely never go shopping without it! Thank you!
5,cece des,This app has changed my life!! I didn‚Äôt know such a thing existed! I‚Äôm beyond grateful for this app!! I can make better and healthier informed choices!
5,Kontch,I absolutely love this app‚Ä¶it is so helpful to be able to determine the quality of a food product.  Makes clean eating so much more doable!!!
5,tippys0310,"I use it every day!  Thank you so much for your hard, important work and I'm very very happy that now I can check skincare too. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Ethandapsycho184,Yuka can do everything to make you eat better to seeing what products to use. I like Yuka download fit it‚Äôs good. I screamed with out the s
5,scain12321,"This app is one of the best apps you can have! It has changed the way I think, use and buy!"
5,Ur Boi Reliving,"Quick and easy to use, even gives recommendations on your unhealthy products"
5,hahaaah,You will scan everything!!!
5,marcyfn,This is the easiest and most essential app for anyone who is conscious about their health and the products they are putting in their bodies.  Wonderful team of developers!  Get this app!  Thank you YUKA!
5,McBee5,I couldn‚Äôt believe how many of my beauty products basically had poison‚Äôs in them. Then the food!  I‚Äôve told all I know about this app.
5,melowrimore,I have been hoping for an app like this for years! So convenient and helps me keep potentially harmful chemicals and additives out of my home. Keep up the good work!
3,Katkatkat123,Tried to upload a new product that was a juice and the label only gives the serving size in fluid ounces but the app forced me to type it in grams. Some fields like protein and carbs wouldn‚Äôt allow me to type in the proper #.
5,EndoMarc,"If you want to preserve your health, and fight back the commercial food industry‚Äôs war against real food , look no further."
5,Ocdlaw,"I love this app with one exception but I work around it. ‚ÄúSalt‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be something that so downgrades a food. If you aren‚Äôt eating carbs and seed oils salt is a benefit, not a detriment. I just disregard it."
5,DanoGreen5,"This app is free, and the scanning is faster than any grocery store  Quality all around.  We need more apps like this  Thank you Yuka"
3,dal1mdm,"When I first open the app it asks me to sign in, but I have no account to sign into. Tried following the prompts but I get an error message. Maybe because I don‚Äôt have an account?"
5,Gia_Carangi,This is the best app Ive ever seen! I wish I could thank in person the brilliant people who created this. I just became a premium member and it‚Äôs even better!
5,rancog,It‚Äôs amazing how many products we were using that aren‚Äôt actually that great. It‚Äôs been accurate too.
4,Cece*_*,"I love this app and have been using for the longest time! I have shared it with a minimum of 100 people! However, i do think seed oils should be taken into consideration while eating the product."
1,ksgkranz,"I was scanning EVERYTHING. Was so proud of myself for trying to do better for myself and my family, only to recently find out that almost everything that I was getting because it scanned as good or better, is BIOENGINEERED!! I‚Äôm so bummed, feels like you can‚Äôt win anymore when trying to find stuff that‚Äôs 100% real and healthy"
5,leavenotrace,Thanks!!!
5,MoeRich,"Now if they can take harmful inflammatory cancer causing oils and gums and add them to the risk list, it would be perfect. Thank you Yuka for helping us be safe!"
1,mrsfunkyflea,"I thought this would be helpful but it‚Äôs not at all! It recommends so many food with bad seed oils and it lists warnings for sugar (even natural) and small amount of calories. There is no access to the nutrition labels when scanning so you can see for yourself where the rating is coming from. It was very disappointing, I wanted to love it!"
2,Livelifetothefullest:),I paid for the subscription just to be met with a loading screen any time I try to search for a product‚Ä¶ no point in paying for a feature that doesn't work.
5,Foodie RN 1982,I‚Äôm loving this app. Was surprised to find some foods I ‚Äúthought‚Äù were healthy are filled with chemicals and sugars. It makes healthy choices easier
5,HollyJ1654,This app is super easy to use. It‚Äôs helping me make better choices when I shop. I Highly recommend.
5,glencoeb,I‚Äôve switched products and use this app for everything!!
5,nonnacookieams,This is THE best app to keep you the consumer educated!  A must when shopping.  Best to know what is in the products you use.  So very happy that I discovered this most helpful app
5,Torysad,This app is really helpful which shows the downside and advantages of each products thank you
5,Kevydabeast23 on psn,"This is an amazing app that helps you make better healthy choices with products you consume or cosmetics, shampoos, conditioners, etc you use.  This was a real eye opener! I absolutely love the Yucat√°n app!"
5,EduardoBorges,"Many people asked me each time I‚Äôm going  To Costco, and everybody asked me for the app. You create something good for the people. Thank you!"
4,emily_gh,I love it but I like how easy it it you just scan it and go! And I like how it gives you like if it good excellent poor or bad and I like how it has a beauty option love it! And it tells you if it to salty or to sweet
4,WW wannabe,I LOVE the concept of this app and have been wanting something like this! I‚Äôve scanned a couple of things so far and I‚Äôve noticed talc is listed as ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù and green. That does concern me so far.
5,Va117,Somewhere we can go and find the truth because if it's not there we put it in. Best program ever.
5,Jonas-Val√®re,"Either you live good life and live longer or you live bad and die earlier‚Ä¶ !!! It‚Äôs a choice.  If you want  live longer and enjoy LIFE, you have the right App here. Since I get this App, my family and friends are HEALTHIER and enjoy life better.  ‚ÄúYou shall know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will send you FREE.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy PEOPLE die because of lack of education and knowledge ‚Äú.  Let us celebrate LIFE by making good choices.  May God bless us ALL."
5,Suzq5555,"Easy to use, super helpful! Identifies harmful additives in your food and cosmetics. I use it constantly. I highly recommend."
5,xxxalicex3,I‚Äôm learning about harmful additives through this app. I really appreciate the work you have put into this app!
5,Nicky_Malta,"Love this app! It‚Äôs saving me from using and buying crappy products, while recommending better ones."
2,jahwjdnavdmgwkvsnsne skj Love,"Why should I have to pay just to search a certain item? What if I don‚Äôt have something on hand right away? This app supposedly wants to help people become more aware, but how can one become more aware if their actions are limited. A stupid thing really."
3,NewZack,"+6: scans super fast, app feels snappy -1: interface is too simple, can‚Äôt change settings -3: food ingredients list missing now +3: scoring helps me compare products -2: product evaluations are too harsh"
5,Yuka excellent,Very informative with really really good information about preservatives calories sugars and everything you can imagine.
2,-thatbytch,"I just recently download this app this morning, and I have already scanned half of my kitchen. Lol. So many unhealthy things that I am eating and my family. Needless to say there will be a lot of changes moving forward. Thank you for creating this app. It is definitely needed!"
1,HeartForBrains,"Look, I think the app is nice but I can‚Äôt use it at all. I cant even scan since my camera is broken (it won‚Äôt focus on things up close) and I thought to myself, ‚Äúhuh, maybe they‚Äôll have a search bar‚Äù and I tried just to see that you have to pay?? Like what??"
5,jarebe,Takes a lot of guess work out of understanding labels. Giving recommendations is top tier. Avoiding chemicals is so much easier.
5,not kids friendly,"I love this app! Not only is it enjoyable to scan everything, but to see all ingredients that are good and harmful  is health and it‚Äôs best! I completely recommend!"
3,MatthewisMathis,"It loves sugar and hates sodium. The ratings are really far off on macronutrients,   but I appreciate its help with finding harmful preservatives. I wish it focused more on the particular ingredients that have shown to be healthy or unhealthy such as olive oil vs grape seed oil, both of which are high fat but not equal in health terms."
5,Ssmelly Melly,"Love this for mine and my kids food , shampoo even makeup !!!! It‚Äôs a must have if you want to know what your putting in AND putting on your body :)"
5,Irisftw,You guys should create something where you are able to scan female hygiene productsü´°üëçüèº
4,üò°üò§üò°üò§üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°üò§üò°,Love this app. So many of the products I was using were bad. Felt good getting rid of them and replacing them with good ones.  Hopefully it will cover more products soon.
3,lipidsup,This app is a good start to reading food labels and making better choices. I do find it sort of bias because most of the foods recommended are found at Trader Joe‚Äôs. It seems like I‚Äôm being encouraged to shop there as opposed to a regular store.
5,Bri Haan,I‚Äôve never used a more helpful & informational app in my life!! I‚Äôm not a doctor so idk what‚Äôs true or not but it says healthy foods are healthy and exposes ones that aren‚Äôt so great. I love this app.
5,torresdx,I started to use this app to make good decisions about the products I am purchasing. I am using it to purchase healthy items
2,Phekeys,"I can‚Äôt trust this app when the same product is listed as excellent AND poor on different photos. Example of you search Estee Lauder the double wear foundation shows poor, however when you filter best rated it shows excellent which is untrue as estee has never been clean"
5,Team gateway,I can‚Äôt stop scanning all my food now. It‚Äôs helping me make better food choices that‚Äôs for sure.
5,Queen KLS,This app has helped me streamline my beauty routine. I feel confidence in what I‚Äôm using and not overwhelmed by numerous products that are unhealthy.  Highly recommended.
5,44.jfyb_,I‚Äôm so thankful that there is an application that can help me know what is best to keep out of my body and familys' body. It then recommends healthier options. So thank you Yuka!
5,Dave@24,I have been scanning everything I buy. Yuka is saving my life! Literally! I have eating so healthy now that I have got Yuka! 100% Recommend
1,biester T,"This will not help you select healthier products, it provides NO nutritional or health and safety information.  It also recommends products that are more unhealthy than the one you scanned.  For example: it recommended a product with artificial sweeteners and dyes, over a natural fruit based product, because of saturated fat (and saturated fat is good for you)"
1,my souls fury,This app is not user friendly. It forbids anything that is not directly food. If it is food related even it will not help you out. They will ban you for the smallest infraction. Also only premium users have access to the search aspect of this app and you have to pay for that particular ‚Äútreat‚Äù. Complete disappointment .
1,maddi.c,I‚Äôm a retailer who thoroughly researched every ingredient in a product line that I sell. It‚Äôs the only line that I sell yucca fall asleep put incorrect ingredients when my client scanned it. The entire list was incorrect. I immediately called the manufacturer to alert them because I don‚Äôt think a company like this should be allowed to falsify ingredients on a product.
5,CamMinigun,Dude this app is so cool!! It provides every ingredient used in products and is top app on my phone!! Would highly recommend this app too anyone!
5,uptight24,S O to my Son for Turning Me on to your App. Information and Knowledge is PWR when it comes to Your Health. Appreciate Your Contribution to those who want to make it to the Health Finish Line üëäüèΩüíØ
4,blackpepperrrr,"I love this app, it has changed my life. It just needs a place to leave feedback for companies that poison people with hazardous chemicals and additives!!"
5,Stormy 28,I love this app and it has helped with my grocery shopping so much. I got put on a very strict diet and this is so much quicker than reading labels.
5,SatanChild666,This app has changed my life and I hope it never becomes corrupted or taken off the App Store!
3,Dixxxxie,I wish I could I could edit what I think is too much sodium or sugar and calories because those aren‚Äôt things I worry about that much so I don‚Äôt want it to affect the scores as much as they do
1,zachariah91,"The ratings of the food are literally fake. The products I scanned where the most processed and full of additive ingredients I could find; I.e. Skippy peanut butter, Chex mix, triscuits, and many more. These all got decent ratings. And it said there no toxic additives in almost every one. It‚Äôs just not true. Hopefully my review doesn‚Äôt get deleted for speaking up."
5,gkfyjchvsijk,Great to help break down products for allergies and just to understand better what your using
5,juglaucio,"Amazing app, I thought was eating good, the app helped me to refine my tune, I made some change in my foods and now I scan every Item üòÖ. I'm happy with this app."
2,Badboy B,I loved this app.  I shared it with several family members.  But then I made the mistake of paying for the upgraded version.  Now all it does is crazy the app over and over again while it tries to synch. Worthless now.  DO NOT PAY for the premium version.
5,400009,Absolutely eye opening and insightful! Have made a lot of smart changes because if this app!!
1,LUCY in the skyy,I used to love this app and use it all the time but now I use it and ingredients that are absolutely bad for you. Are now showing up as ‚Äúhealthy quote everyone said that they sold out and you can pay for a good reviews for your products but I didn‚Äôt believe them until I saw it for myself. It‚Äôs a scam don‚Äôt download it.
5,StarPuppyFan238,This app is exactly what I‚Äôve dreamed of. I hate constantly being paranoid and this solved that issue
5,BuyerBee,I‚Äôm so glad I found Yuka! I‚Äôm using it on a regular basis and it‚Äôs impacting my purchases is such a positive way. I‚Äôm also telling all my friends about Yuka.
5,cef08,Super interesting to see what‚Äôs in the products I use every day. It‚Äôs eye opening and probably super important to know!
5,Falls 4ever,My go to app when shopping. Instant feedback that I trust 100%. My health has overall improved since using Yuka!
5,BataviaBulldog,I love this app. It really helps me buy cleaner and healthier products for me and my family. Super easy to use and saves me a ton of time while shopping.
5,scilenttoaster,This app has saved my anxiety with buying products that are safe for my kids. It‚Äôs really helped us become a healthier household.
5,chuparose,Yuka is the best app going that contributes to good Health. I am so excited about this app that I am telling everybody.   I have changed to better eating and cleaner cosmetics  Thank You so much üôèüèΩ
2,Momo2519,This app would‚Äôve been nice except it told me a food was too fatty when all I was looking for was of it was processed or has artificial colors or flavors. Under calories there is also a range for a good amount of calories? This app is not good for anyone who is good conscious or has an eating disorder
5,Jumping Judi,Love this app!! Changing the way I eat and my cosmetics use!! Well worth it to become a member not only for information but to be supportive.
5,Smoke Up LLC,Love this app helps me know n why all them words I can‚Äôt pronounce on the back ingredients stop eating a lot of stuff because of this
5,StoweMamma,"Seriously Thankful to be able to educate myself on products quality prior to purchasing them! And FDA approves all these dangerous ingredients, they are a joke."
5,bubblexj,Amazing app to see how your eating tells you what‚Äôs healthy or not and the premium membership is not really expensive
5,Kara's the swan,"As the title states, download and save money. Start buying things that are better for one‚Äôs health and being."
5,wavesolo10,Love the app and thankfully it has changed the ‚Äúfoods‚ÄùI had been eating. Eating better had been a goal of mine for a while.
5,Laimislv,"My three kids already made healthier choices because of this app, amazing!"
5,1111111xo,Love the app but it would be awesome to have the ability to scan clothing tags to see what dyes and chemicals are used in the production process
5,KittySchwe,"Shocking, the hazardous ingredients that we were eating! Thank you for  showing us a healthier choice plus we‚Äôre losing weight!"
5,Coop0204,This app has been helpful in my attempts to live as healthy as life as possible. Thank you for this easy to use tool.
3,FrugalMomof6,"I would love this app if I could just type in the food I want to check out while I make a shopping list or before ordering online, but it is not included in this free app. üòû"
5,BeaverCover,Love being able to see how food actually rates rather than relying on (most usually) misleading advertising.
5,JCL_NC,So thankful I learned about this app thru a friend! It‚Äôs scary and deeply disturbing how many harmful ingredients are in the foods we eat everyday! Thanks for creating this & sharing it with the world!
5,DolphinJade113,Obsessed with this app! Very eye opening. Love how it breaks down why something is rated and then explaining what something means (like endocrine disrupter). My favorite aspect is the alternate suggestions!
2,FabianRial20,"A few weeks ago, I was buying the v8 Pomegranate and Strawberry Banana juice because it showed me an estimate of 60%-80% health in both of them. Fast forward to today, the  apps is giving these product a 30%. They are clearly still not aware of what is and isn‚Äôt healthy."
5,Mcc2lmnop,"I love love love this app!!! Knowing what has healthy or not so healthy ingredients in my store bought food, makes our healthy eating live style a piece of cake! Thank thank for inventing this app üôèüôåüôåüòÉ Margit"
2,Suzupetal,I use Monat exclusively‚Ä¶ and was very sad to see our gel only rated 29  due to butylphenyl methylproponial. So I threw the rest out.  Today I checked the ingredients on Monat website with what Yuka has listed and there is absolutely NONE period.  So I beg you to double check the ingredients on the bottle with this app.
1,J3NN4LF,"Downloaded the app but I can‚Äôt sign up because I keep getting an error message saying that my email address is invalid. I‚Äôve tried multiple working email addresses, I think it‚Äôs a glitch. I couldn‚Äôt submit a direct request for assistance because the webform requires a an email address tied to an account.."
5,friedmister,"It‚Äôs as if the Yuka team read my mind and made a reality. The ease of use, explanations, scoring, history, all of it. What an amazing tool."
5,stay healthy live longer,A must get if you are watching the foods that you eat. I should have found this app sooner. I highly recommend.
5,Aprevatt,Was amazed by all the toxic items I had and was using day to day. Love the fact that it gives substitutions ‚Ä¶
1,Jacki Allen 1984,Sometimes I scan items and they come up good or excellent so I buy it and then scan it again later and it comes up as poor or bad. This has happened multiple times where I purchased something I thought was good but then the readings changed out of nowhere.
5,noelle121,Everyone needs this app on their phone. Its a huge help and really is an eye opener to the products that i use on a daily basis
5,Jamie2bad,Grateful for this app!!!! I scan everything before I buy
4,J√§ger Ziegler,"Their rating system is a bit arbitrary, so you have to decide based on the ingredients. They provide great information and this app has been a net positive on my life."
5,bfitz1029,It has virtually every food/cosmetic item ive scanned and shows all the info in a user friendly way.
5,suckabuck,So easy to give up food that you like when you see how much poison is in it!
5,RockyLNK,"Working in the fitness/health coaching industry, this app is amazing for helping people ‚Äúswap up‚Äù their food and make healthier choices!"
1,Jase1125,"To sign up you are required to enter your email address.  Guess what that results in - email spam. Disappointing and uninstalling this app.  Also, please do not tell me to unsubscribe.  I did not ask to be subscribed in the first place.  You should ASK before signing me up for mailing lists and spam.  It needs to be OPT-IN instead of OPT-OUT."
5,Emmy.miller,I use Yuka so often and am so grateful that there is this type of resource available! Highly recommend!!!!
5,teriburgessbrown,I‚Äôm naturally a label reader but this app makes it so much easier! I‚Äôd love to see supplements added as an option as well! ü•ï
5,Eric Greitins Hater,I love this app because it serves its purpose perfectly and only a couple things are premium which is nice.
3,Shjshorbridhebrun,"I‚Äôve found 3 mistakes in the ingredients list on three products. Just got the app. Also, I have the paid subscription. Should be able to search by ingredients not just by product."
5,nutro-wholistic,I  love Yuka. I am a registered dietitian and I spend the majority of my work day teaching my clients how to analyze the food labels. This app makes my work so much easy. Thank you Yuka team!! F
1,TheGreenhouse3,"I liked there app when I first got it, but suddenly it will not scan anymore. All settings have been checked and verified. Latest version is installed. It's mostly useless now. If they fix it I'll try again but otherwise it's absolutely not worth it."
5,Green Cobra 136,"In God‚Äôs World we‚Äôre all supposed to stay healthy; that‚Äôs the reason why I had to choose the Yuka app itself. Therefore, I‚Äôm enjoying this app A LOT."
5,EMMAKELLY13,It is amazing and helping me with beauty and food and also shows me that‚Äôs some things that seem good aren‚Äôt always that watt
5,26976422,"This app is invaluable to me, thank you Yuka! It gives me the information I need to easily choose safer products. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5,vivian follett,I thought that this app wasn‚Äôt a good app but to my surprise it WORKS SO GOOD and I really like it you try it for yourself and see how you like it
5,just curious 0508,Is there a truck to the camera? Scanner. Mine won‚Äôt register the barcodes half the time
1,Agh16,"I‚Äôve never had a Yuka account before. I downloaded the app and it won‚Äôt let me create an account. I even tried to create an count with my husbands email as well as my school email and it keeps saying ‚Äúoops this email seems invalid‚Äù. So disappointed, I really just want an account made!"
1,kaleigh_s01,"My mom recommended this app to me, and it seems like a really cool concept. However it will not let me make an account. It keeps telling me that my email is invalid. I really wish someone would fix this because I really want to use it. There is also NO other way to ‚Äúsign in‚Äù just email."
5,Mandic5,This app is so helpful when shopping for my family.  It makes healthy choices easy!
5,Andrew1408,I love using this app to make sure that I‚Äôm buying the best food and products for me every day üôåüèæ
5,fatemah99999,Because of this I discovered a lot of things that have been making me sick and look pale all the time.
5,Sierre N,I absolutely love this app! It has changed the way I buy things for myself and my children. A must have app!
5,Mariajosecortesvallejo,OMG I don‚Äôt know how the people doesn‚Äôt know about this app! Marvelous!! Thank you so much for creating this great tool for us to keep a healthy life style!
5,keig-o,"This is the coolest idea for an app, I feel healthier already just scanning the food I already have and looking for alternatives the next time I go shop. Love this."
5,kawaiikaz,As of September 2024 this is an honest source for the toxic ingredients in our food. If there are mistakes users can scan the ingredients label and fix discrepancies.
2,FlopBox,"It‚Äôs okay it has a wide variety of products but I have some issues. Other apps of similar feature have different ratings and rate some products worse than Yuka does. I scanned a product with Yellow 5, a well know carcinogen, and it rated the product as excellent.ü§® Yuka needs to update their standards."
4,KingOfDr3amz,It‚Äôs a great app to help find healthier things and be healthier in live. Just missing links or telling us where we can get the items from.
4,hudatarqaliqadr,I wish if we can upload a photo of the barcode
5,Kitcn 1985,"very cool app but when you show an alternative show where to buy that alternative!? near me, or sellers"
5,LAURAVEJA,I love this app and always use it to select new food products or cosmetics. I recommend it to everyone.
4,Melina Gutchigian,"Yuka is a really good app when it comes to checking the greatness of things. But, if i scan an item good for my skin, it gives it a low score. But overall , its pretty good!"
5,Jmartinez2099,Incredible source of information for food & products. Thank you guys
5,MaryJunelady,I cant imagine grocery shopping without this app now.  I cant believe all the junk i was feeding my family!  Yuka is awesome!
5,SalkyJo,I am so grateful for this phenomenal site!!! We try so hard to eat healthy and guess what we haven‚Äôt been!  Oh my goodness what an eye opener!  I‚Äôm going to tell all my friends & family.  Thank you to the YUKA team.    My next favorite app is OrganizEat which is only a couple of people who have made a fantastic app.   Here‚Äôs a shoutout to the small groups making great apps!
4,radgirl39299,I do love the app first found out about it on TikTok but when I download it I was shocked that it was asking for my email and stuff wish it didn‚Äôt have that
5,Roartp,What a great project! Just became a premium member after using it for a day. It‚Äôs so easy to use and it‚Äôs such a nice project allowing people to pay what they can!! Thanks so much YUKA!!!!!
5,Zeewho,Very informative and very user friendly. Keep on adding more products. Thanks
5,yungdre1,Very good app. I would definitely recommend people to download it
5,Tee tee322,I love it and they also show you better alternatives to get after rating
5,KleighCo,This app helps break down the products we use everyday to show the good and bad. A+
3,Turtle110,The people that own this app should make it so we can pick a diet that were on like vegetarian so when we scan the food and can help us with that but just a suggestion.
5,Kato V.,Just downloaded and WOWED definitely see myself using this app for my shopping from here on out!!
5,Travis Haar,Was recommended to me by one of my fianc√©e‚Äòs best friends; will never ever shop without it again!
5,IamJackHavick,This app needs to be used in every corner of the world. I‚Äôve been sharing it as much as I can!
5,Meluvdapunani,Really opened my eyes to the things I‚Äôve been consuming. I really like that they site the sources for their findings. Must have app.
5,üòúüòúüòçü§®,"it‚Äôs important to be cautious of what your using especially skincare and body care, etc. some brands use really harmful chemicals and you can learn about them just by scanning something. if your products not already on the app you can just scan the ingredients and it‚Äôll tell you whether it‚Äôs good or not. i love that it‚Äôs free too"
5,stocktongt,"I love this app, the more products they add the safer I feel. It‚Äôs always useful in educating my decisions when purchasing food."
4,duckiegogo,"one suggestion I would love to see is rating the various refined oils that are harmful for us such as canola and sunflower oil helping us recognize the harmful additives, as well as other normally unrecognizably harmful ingredients."
2,budahon3,I could not get passed the password to creat a log in. It keeps turning yellow and won‚Äôt allow me to enter anything. Tried deleting and re downloading but didn‚Äôt work. I would like to try this app but unable to use it
1,dmalc.27,"This app just recommends products they have contracts with. Its not honest, doctor recommended products they give a poor rating, then recommend an item that has poor reviews from purchasing websites. Waste of time, misleading Should be taken off the app store"
5,Jkism22,this app is actually a game changer. I hope who ever made this masterpiece and humble app finds happiness and lives a a fulfilling life.
5,RG travel,I love scanning products in the grocery store to find the cleanest options for an option
5,Scrollbass 27,"This app is incredibly eye opening. The only thing missing is gluten free options for people with Celiac disease. Other than that, amazing."
4,Yammyb,Great app. I would love if it would pick up seed oils towards ratings on food. I have also seen it not pick up on things such as red 40. Love the app either way!
3,Peggy 102030,"I really like the Yuka app, and find it helpful in terms of quickly identifying toxic / unhealthy ingredients. However‚Ä¶ it is a HUGE miss that Yuka is not identifying unhealthy seed oils included in food ingredients. I am working really hard to avoid seed oils, and Yuka ignores them completely."
5,IMCatfish,I love this app. It is a must for clean eating and makeup. It has totally changed the makeup I use and the way I shop at the grocery store.
5,Gramps Fox,"Fantastic tool for healthy food choices, at age 85 the change in my diet has been supported and driven by Yuka in an extremely positive direction üëèüèªüëèüèªü¶ä Tommy"

5,gardening cindy,"A friend turned me on to this app, and i think it‚Äôs fantastic.  Its fun and educational, helping my family make informed food choices.. I am spreading the word!"
1,AshenLion,"It‚Äôs bad enough they‚Äôre facing a class action lawsuit, but also consider their recommendations are not based off the concentration and practicality of the ingredients of the products you buy. This app offers a bare minimum baseline of what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù, but will not offer an accurate summary of how harmful your product will be for you."
5,Johhny167,This app is absolutely amazing. It has a very good amount of products in its database and it‚Äôs extremely informative. I‚Äôm very impressed with this app. Great job!
3,Reckum07,"You don‚Äôt seem to have any products that Publix sells in the realm of kale, spinach, or lettuce. Would like to know why, is this just a general thing? I did sign up for the premium account and gave the most I could. We"

4,Sharon stamford,Can you put the grocery or pharmacy store in the update can find products better
1,irock14,No use for cosmetics either !! The app called all The face sunscreens found in CVS poor !! And named one mineral one by Avene. I scanned all the avene mineral sunscreens and now in France And it still says they are all poor. This app is a waste of time !! Maybe food for food. That I don‚Äôt know A waste of my $15.  Don‚Äôt pay them a penny
5,Katisathall,This app opened my eyes to what I was putting into my body. I recommend this to everyone.
1,Clonumber3,"This app is ridiculous. It is nothing but fear mongering, false information that is not based on science. It does not consider important context and over simplifies complex information to the point that it is useless at best. You cannot simply red light or green light every ingredient out there without context. Stop the fear mongering."
5,Amanda and Skye,"I just got this and it is so interesting. My husband: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scan my ranch!‚Äù Sorry babe, it‚Äôs a bad rating. Love it."
1,krukrew21,I don‚Äôt trust the information this app is providing. They recommend products that have synthetic fragrance in them over better alternatives. Anything with synthetic fragrance should be a big red X on the scale. Not to mention many other ingredients their seeming as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or better.
5,Mehr246,Has lots of remove to develop . Would have loved to see it connected to Instacart or shopping . Thank u
4,Pam99967654,"I‚Äôm disappointed with this app! I was buying a facial cleanser and searched it, and it said it was excellent. But if I scan it, it says it‚Äôs poor. So which is it?? So so disappointing. Can‚Äôt trust it"
3,roxalee,Can‚Äôt really get a full experience without roping in other users after I ponied up $ to use it. That is scammy to me.  Fix this! I purposely didn‚Äôt choose sales as a career.
5,Mama leash,I am loving this app!  Thank you for keep us all aware of what ingredients are in the products we buy. Education is keyü•∞
5,Shopping navigation,This app helps me shop smarter won‚Äôt shop without it! No more deception of products labeled healthy but not !

3,Artsy animal lover,"I initially liked this app, but overtime found that most drugstore products have bad ratings and this shouldn‚Äôt be the case. I don‚Äôt think that every product from shampoo to body wash has toxic ingredients. We have the FDA for a reason."
5,LoveLibrary,Love this free app! It‚Äôs easy to use and extremely helpful if you want to reduce your toxic load both in foods and beauty products!
5,Cdiz1457,I love this app and I really like the new feature that allows you to call out brands for having harmful additives and ingredients!
5,Tori‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,"I wish I could use it on everything, but I‚Äôm very impressed with how much it scans! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5,Pokurfan,Everyone needs this app. Foods I thought were healthy actually contain terrible additives.
5,RenaBess,This is a very useful tool. Especially if you‚Äôre trying to eat healthy/right.
4,Happyone123456,"I like this app, I wish it would list seed oils if they are in the ingredient list. I told my OBGYN about this app. She sad it‚Äôs great but it doesn‚Äôt list seed oils which we all must avoid. Please add this feature."
3,Eliza saltylocks,"Great app for making you conscientious about dietary choices. Sure, I live by the motto ‚Äúall things in moderation‚Äù but seeing the ratings of some of my favorite munchies gives me pause. I like that the app suggests alternatives that are similar but healthier."
5,S. Gigi,"The Yuka app makes shopping healthy for my grandkids possible! Thank you, Yuka!!! The scan feature really works!"
1,MomOfLotOf5,Until it stopped working.  It doesn‚Äôt let me Sign in with Apple‚Ä¶. It won‚Äôt send me a rest link though I try and try.  I got a new phone and I can‚Äôt use it anymore because of the issues.  Won‚Äôt let me unless I sign in and all attempts to sign in have been futile.    Save yourself the hassle.
3,Asdf1134,Trouble inputting more items. It asked me like 10 times back to back to take a picture of the ingredients and the pictures were good so i am unsure what happened.
5,LathanF,I love this app. It scans a lot of stuff and it doesn‚Äôt just have to be food. Highly recommend!
4,Nicknamefhg,I love this app but I wish you could search up products for free it annoys me because some of my products don‚Äôt have a barcode.
5,Dhhh767777,I use this app nearly every time I shop. It‚Äôs fantastic for being more aware of what I‚Äôm eating.
5,Twinkledv,Excellent!!! Finding out things I thought were healthy aren‚Äôt and reassured about others
5,Cee 8/23,"It‚Äôs inevitable that this app is going to help millions of people who have only considered eating healthier, now they have a guide.  As a very conscientious eater, even I find this app beneficial."
5,NotARealName_K,If you scan and then it says it‚Äôs not good it will give you super healthy alternatives that are the same thing
3,aob505,"I appreciate what the app is trying to do, but I‚Äôd take any advice with a grain of salt. Yeah certain ingredients can cause health issues when consumed in excessive amounts. But I‚Äôd say just skip the app and read your labels. Moderation in life is key."
5,JesiSantos,Highly functional
4,Mr. Lee Dr . Lee,The only thing I wish you could do on the free version is search for products.
5,Chinna0777,This app saved my life! I can now easily shop and not feel guilty!  Thank you so much!!
5,RubyLady14,Very pleased with this app as there are some many products with false claims and misrepresented information. This app is much appreciated!!
5,noalasocala,Yuka directa me toward products without harmful additives.  For decades everyone has been confused by marketing.  What could be more urgently needed than this app?
5,Elsaanna18,"It only rates by how natural the product is, but i have noticed a great improvement in my skin and hair IMMEDIATELY after i started using Yuka!"
5,marilyn couch,"I love this app so much , it has helped me become better at my healthy food habits and we‚Äôre to get better skincare too!!"
5,Shaun Dolla $ign,Great app its extremely useful if you‚Äôre trying to eat healthy
5,jahahakte,"Independent rating app of beauty products and processed food and packaged produce, how could it get any better? How are you going to justify eating the garbage now?"
5,Kevinlite,"I‚Äôm telling you, this app is looking out for us. Be aware of what you put in your mouth and on your skin. This app helps, no cap."
5,Angry hate this game,i haven‚Äôt rated an app since vine. this app is great and i love that it offers you the choice to plug in a new item if it‚Äôs not already listed!! this definitely will come in handy and i already showed so many people. the only thing i ask is that you guys add an alcohol section that would be very helpful as well but absolutely love!!
5,I are cool,This is one of the most helpful apps I‚Äôve ever used and it is helping me have a good diet.               (Written by a 12 year old)
1,boquesa,"Every time I try to sign in/create an account, it just loops me right back to the ‚Äúlets get started‚Äù pageü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏ètheres nothing else to click and nothing I can do about it. All I can do is try it over and over again until it works which is not ganna happenüòÇ"
1,33Openclosed,"Could have been great but I would do your own research and not rely on this app for healthy choices.   This apps rating system is not good or accurate. It uses the FDA to help score items and we all know how messed up the FDA is. The FDA allows yellow/red dye and seed oils in our foods and deems them ‚Äúsafe for consumption‚Äù. Both of which are linked to many health problems.   It depends on what you consider healthy, but seed oils are not healthy in my eyes and this app is rating products with seed oils as ‚Äúgood‚Äù.  Also this app thinks saturated fat is ‚Äúbad‚Äù which is a lie that was infiltrated by the sugar companies."
5,Galeur,"Helps me make better food choices, and I have lost weight! Highly recommended!"
5,Trey Maziarz,This app has help me make quick and easy decisions. It is very honest and has helped me and my freinds a lot in daily life.
5,mgkisafail,"I like the app, but I think this app would be more cool if it showed whether or not an item is halal"
5,Acesyyshehw,100%recommend to anybody. super easy to use and has great and helpful features
3,Bwimmer88,"This app deserves a 5 stars, for sure. But why not take it one step further and let us know if the ingredients/product is tested on animals or if vegan or not? Other than that. 10 out of 10!!"
5,MzBrown47,I didn‚Äôt realize what I was putting on my body and in it until I ran across this app. I love it.
5,Fitz-dog,The app is a wonderful way to scan items to see if they are a healthy choice or not. Love it!
5,ar1914avr,I‚Äôm so dedicated to living purely and safe. This app is a life saver and totally warns you about any scary ingredients in food & beauty!!! Loveeeeee.   I wish there was one for medicines + laundry detergents as well.
5,Jason the swagger,If people start using this app to become healthier manufacturers will have to stop poisoning us and use beneficial ingredients.
5,Hehjlksksnus,"not great of an app. i‚Äôve checked the ingredients on products and food and sometimes they miss them. i dont like how they dont check on the products themselves and we are only able to rely on what the consumers post about the product, which is really not reliable at all."
5,blackpinklisa323,This app is so good with beauty prouducts skin care omg I have scanned every prouducts I have and removing them if they were bad for me my skin has been so good !!!! I love this app so much for dodo and beauty it‚Äôs so good DOWNLOAD IT
1,trash...........,"Inaccurate information. If you search some of the ingredients this app says are harmful, it turns out they‚Äôre not that bad. They listed petroleum jelly as very harmful. How can you say Vaseline is very harmful. This is just fear mongering. Also it will give a food product a 0 because it has too many calories. Bad vibes in general."
4,Lolz‚Ä¢,"This app is amazing, and it helps stay healthy. But when it comes to scanning the beauty products (such as shampoo, soap, and deodorant) it should show if they animal test or not.   Thanks for reading, have a good day <3"
5,Lyndsey1119,Love this app! Thank you for making it so easy to be educated and make healthy decisions for my family!
5,Yuka girl,"In our house hold,we struggle to grab all healthy food at the grocery store. With Yuka, we are grabbing way better things!!"
5,Dario Ninja,I decided to donate to this app a couple of months ago because of how much i use it and how helpful it is!!
5,Petesmckgeets,Yuka is tremendously informative and extremely accessible. This app clearly analyzes the the pros and cons to your health on a wide variety of products. If you value your health download Yuka.
5,val-erm,That‚Äôs definitely my favourite app! I changed so many of my product thanks to yuka! I feel healthier now!!
5,rebewinwin,So easy and useful and I wish everyone used it so companies would make better food!
5,Yuka is Yum,Amazing app to check all those chemicals that are potentially harmful to your body and I am sure banned in other European countries
5,ChampagnePimpin,Definitely opened my eyes as to all the products in my body
5,Dinoraptor101,"Do NOT shop without this.  It lists all ingredients, which one is bad and why, links scientific peer reviewed sources, Bought Premium to support this!!!"
3,shellbuglove,"I love this app mostly‚Ä¶but they do not take into account seed oils, which are highly inflammatory to our body. It will rate a product with safflower oil, canola oil, etc higher than a product with avocado or olive oil. This needs fixed in this app!!"
5,Daniellle.NV,I‚Äôve been using Yuka for over a year now. It‚Äôs a staple. The membership is so worth it. I love this app so much.
5,Manjula C,It is very helpful to understand that what we are eating is healthy or not for us. Thank you üôèüèª
5,Gracieosaurus,This is one of (if not THE) most useful apps on my phone. Please consider downloading! Your happiness and health will thank you later!!
2,Sunnylistener,Several products were checked directly with label and did not reflect the same numbers which then gave the food a poor rating or good rating. So very bias. It was a huge difference so now can not trust it on any food.
2,sinnern3,"This app was great when I first started using it a few years ago, but I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs changing its rating on products. It‚Äôs even suggesting products that are full of added sugars etc. I can‚Äôt seem to trust it anymore."
5,Auburn Cherry,"This app is seriously incredible, highly recommend! It helped me with my skincare so much"
5,Karrie2011,Ill just put something plain and simple. This app is great it works and shows you what‚Äôs harmful and what‚Äôs good. This app should just be the FDA
1,macfan67,"My sister recommended this app to me today. So I downloaded it to use it. However, it won‚Äôt even let me create an account/login because it‚Äôs stating my email address is invalid. It‚Äôs a valid email address. I‚Äôve been using it for more than a decade. So I can‚Äôt even use this app."
5,Allytiger,I scan everything in the store before I buy it
5,clever roque,We don‚Äôt have idea the what is really good to eat and with this app we have the possibility to learn about it
5,this god,"The creators did an amazing job on this app! If you have this app, make sure you tell everybody about it!"
5,kathleeniebeans,"Shout out to Yuka for this app! Thank you to the creators, this is SUCH a great tool, and my kids have even asked to download it on their ipads.  Love love love love, 10 stars"
5,The Mighty Trojan,Excellent app. I use it every single day. And I've given it to many of my friends.
3,HippieKate,Like the app in terms that it will rate the product. But it won‚Äôt give me recommendations for every product. It also won‚Äôt let me categorize it either
5,Rann0,"Simple, direct, easy to use, fast and super useful. I think apple should turn this app to essentials app!"
5,Susie1913,This app is wonderful. It‚Äôs been so helpful to me I love when its tell you it‚Äôs not good be gives you alternative. It‚Äôs awesome
5,boomoffice,Thanks to TikTok I found this useful app!! It has helped so much choosing healthy & nontoxic products. Gotta look out for my family! Love this app!!!
5,armeniannbaby,"Of course I had to get this app, it is going viral on tiktok. Turns out, Olaplex is not good for your hair! Thank you Yuko, I will now be searching for cleaner products!"
5,photog338,Really great app! But I cant understand why it doesn‚Äôt include the active ingredient/s with so many products.
5,shmueliFan,It has so many products in the database and it‚Äôs very helpful to find fhe junk
5,Acdghjfdth,"Excellent App! A lot of products I was consuming that I thought were healthy, actually are not! Excellent app!"
5,Marge201,"My friend is always quoting this and I finally dl‚Äôd it. It‚Äôs super interesting and as far as I can see, it‚Äôs totally accurate."
5,Lizardlily,This app has changed my life! Every time I see an item and want to know if it‚Äôs good or not I just yuka it!
5,Amolvikramsingh,Donate to them and tell your friends. Everyone should be using this app to inform themselves and vote with their money.
5,Jay_quelin,Love this app - changed my whole perspective on food and what I‚Äôm eating. I could not recommend enough.
2,tarahmw321,Loved this app until I paid for the premium program. App says that it‚Äôs always downloading ‚Äúoffline mode‚Äù but the download never completes before the whole app crashes. I have contacted support and waiting on a response.
5,123 sloth,I wish you did not have to be a member to search
5,crapsidy,Must have if you‚Äôre tired of not knowing what all the long words in the ingredient lists mean.
2,Waste202,Says everything is bad. Doesn‚Äôt scan organic or natural products. A couple of mid product pull ups. I googled to fact check some of the answers it gave me and was given conflicting info. Such as on shampoos (head and shoulders and treatment and herbal essence).
5,Common-Unity,"Absolutely love this app, so helpful & informational. In todays world, we all need a tool like this to help navigate through the things that do not serve our highest good!"
5,Hannah W123,This app will change your life for the better. Love this app. So glad I found it.
5,Wynter425,What an eye opener. I am definitely changing what I am putting in and on my body because of this app.
5,Kaylanelly,It helps me keep a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet especially my hair my skin etc but  a few products that I scanned is not on yuka
5,Quakebig,Wow I think this is going to help me and my friend/ extended family shop a lot more healthy
5,RiverJune2015,I only wish I would have had this app years ago!
5,cinna life,This app is incredible. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs free. I‚Äôve sent it to five of my friends are ready.
5,opusvav,Love this app. Makes going through the grocery store so much easier
5,Patti Bw,"YUKA is The Best App I‚Äôve found that shows what ingredients in our Foods are Healthy & which Ingredients are Unhealthy! It shows Healthy Alternatives!!! Also works on Sunscreens, Toothpaste, etc!!!!  I love this APP!!! It‚Äôs FREE!!!! üéâüéâüéâ"
5,Chikky6,"I got this idea by myself while eating chips eager to know how unhealthy they are When I searched for the idea on google, I was surprised to see the exact app. Downloaded it immediately and found the chips I am eating are unhealthyüòÖ Great way to know the healthy products I referred my friend and got access to the list The app is too good"
1,Farmerswife 2004,"I got a new phone & now can‚Äôt access the app/account. When I submit  a request to reset my  password , nothing happens (link to be sent via email..not in inbox or junk) so have no way to use the app.  This is disappointing because the app is great!"
5,vghhgrdghkmnfwww,It‚Äôs a really great app and its has given me some good information about my products! My fav app for sure!
5,ffvhfhbhvgy,I use this every day but Wish it told me the ingredients in products
5,Preppy1010$$,It‚Äôs a great app. It helps you find what is right and not. I totally recommend this app. I‚Äôm so glad I found Yuka
2,Jimmykus,The app itself is decent maybe a little to heavy on scoring zeros but my main issue is the spam emails. I have unsubscribed multiple times from Yuka emails but keep getting harassed. It‚Äôs really gave me a negative view on a app I used to like.
5,mandyjane03,Im so thankful to have this app and see the hidden dangers of beauty food products! It‚Äôs helped me change my buying habits !
3,d3caying m0lt,The app itself is pretty useful but then not so much because you can‚Äôt search products up unless you pay which really is unfortunate :(
5,Micah 216,Yuca is the best thing out there. I use it to scan everything in the grocery store before I buy it. Thank you Yuca!
5,n¬°Th¬°n,This is really an awesome App! And everyone should have it. Now every time I buy something I check Yuka score.
2,Terence2000,It keep serving an error saying ‚Äúemail looks invalid‚Äù when I input my personal gmail address that I use for literally all other apps. Tried some other emails and it kept returning the same error.
3,Michaela29001,The app is amazing! it really helps you learn about products and what is in them. The only issue since the recent update I have no recommendations on any products and no rated ingredient lists.
5,Kevin Gruy√®re,"I want to thank you for supporting the environment we share together! Word gets around quickly Yuka, we like you!"
5,laurieoc22,I check all my choices at the store now and I find out if they are good for me or not.
5,blavkQueeeen,Wonderful app I use it while shopping so I know I‚Äôm getting the most healthiest items I can . I would recommend this app to EVERYONE FROMT KIDS TO ELDERS
4,me and the app store,so I think you should have this because it just help so you don‚Äôt get any as food inside of you   So please get it  For your own good
5,Trina3839,Helping my family and I make better choices daily
5,Pastafaz,To say that this app is my favorite of all time doesn‚Äôt express enough how much I love it.   What a great idea -
5,A ski fan,"I can just imagine, looking at some healthy food and it says, ‚ÄúYuka approved‚Äù‚Ä¶"
2,Gator82,The options that are recommended are not that healthy. One example: the items with seed oils were listed as a better choice than the item with avocado oil. There were several like this.
5,Jake...fromStareFarm...!,It‚Äôs very time-consuming to determine which processed foods are okay or unhealthy. This app solves that in a millisecond. Brilliant and useful.
5,–ª—é–±–∞–ª–∞–π–∫,It‚Äôs amazing app!! I‚Äôbe been dreaming about an app like this! And now here we are)) thank you so so much!!!
1,ainsley fields,This app is so. Fake when I asked employees and reviews And asked people who had good skin and used the products said it was amazing. I have amazing skin and I use those products for my skincare Routine and when they said they were all bad i knew it was fake. I was on. A FaceTime with a bestie and even she agrees
1,Benskskkc,"For a same brand, same series yogurt, one shows 88 score, calorie is low; another one shows 30 score, because of the calorie is too high. But in fact, the high score one with 190 calorie per serve; the low score one with 130 calorie. Many similar inaccurate scored products."
3,Kkae4,"My husband usually goes wrong when buying protein bars loaded with GMO ingredients, so I was hoping this app would help him. Unfortunately, it does NOT rate high protein products, so it‚Äôs not going to help my husband."
5,Lily needs some help,You‚Äôre not so good get a new mom because your mom‚Äôs a mistake and that‚Äôs why you buy a steak and it turns into a mistake

5,donnamcderrick,"I LOVE this app!  If you‚Äôre passionate about eating healthy and using products that are free of harmful chemicals, this app is for you!"
1,Briasaurasrex,These apps can be really useful but most people don‚Äôt read the fine print. I scanned my Aquaphor (that my dermatologist regs to protect my eczema) and it said it could cause cancer and alter dna. Most people won‚Äôt do their own digging and just look at the ‚Äòbad‚Äô score. These apps cause so much fear for no reason.
3,IrateditYoualreadyknow,Never had a problem with this app until it says i scanned something i didnt scan‚Ä¶
5,kjpalaghia,This app is the absolute best!  It has been a game changer me and my family. The self awareness it provides in regards to our food and cosmetic industry is stellar.   Be INFORMED!!!

5,RicaJan,"The best app ever very informative, unique you should feel proud what you have created"
5,Jessreneeharris,"Recommendations are super easy and they aren‚Äôt pushing any products for sale.   I love the history, ability to favorite, and that a referral gives you premium service.   I took it to the grocery store and it helped inform decisions so fast!  I would love if ‚Äúhigh carb‚Äù or ‚Äúketo‚Äù can be in food preferences.  I‚Äôve already told 5 ppl!"
5,pro cc34,Showed my patients and they both got it and they Love this app so much that they told thair friends         YUKA keep doing what your doing!!!

5,genie612,A wonderful way to weed out chemicals and additives. Ratings are great along with the alternatives. Highly recommend
3,Genie7-7-7,"I‚Äôm sensitive to ingredients that are safe for MOST people, but definitely not for me.   Are there plans to allow customers to flag for ingredients that are dangerous for themselves, but not the general public?"

3,ksmoore999,"I‚Äôd love to know why a product is rated the way it is, especially poor. Too much sugar, too much saturated fat, too many artificial ingredients, etc."
5,StillWater1,"This app is changing the we eat and what skin products we use. No more phosphates, nasty additives etc.  I‚Äôd welcome if cosmetics would indicate if cruelty free."
5,LivyFan,This app has been life changing! Easy to use and I LOVE  that poorly rated products offer  alternatives! Love love love this app!

4,Helen (Hi!),I was surprised with the answers and didn‚Äôt think it was real and I‚Äôm mad that my favorite foods and skincare and makeup are so bad I had to throw them out.
1,YianniD,"So many of the healthy foods I eat which have kept me feeling great and in good health and with good blood test results, this app rates bad or poor. It even rated my Organic Pumpkin Seeds with Sea Salt as bad. Then it recommended a product as good that had 15 grams of added sugar in it! Only one thing to do with this app: DELETE it!"

5,Fam Lifestyle,It‚Äôs a really good app and easy to use. I wish it did have things like detergents and cleaning supplies.
5,audentheman,Who doesn‚Äôt want to know the benefits and harms of items that you use?
1,who even writes app reviews?,It thinks saturated fat is bad. I don‚Äôt understand how any thinking person can believe that after reading any modern research on the subject. This app gives bad advice. It also just says food is bad if it‚Äôs high calorie. Not everyone is trying to lose weight. For me more calories is a good thing.
5,Mokipro,Finding app helpful to check labels and avoid certain additives.
1,Brainz18,I recently got this app and all of a sudden I can only search for items now with a subscription like that‚Äôs really inconvenient to those who can‚Äôt afford it and want to make sure they‚Äôre getting things safe for themselves and children.
1,MsDensie,"I just updated this app, and it no longer lets me know what products contain hazardous chemicals! This is the only reason why I paid $13 for this app!

1,Alice24.,When I first downloaded this app it was great! It was Was super honest about the products ingredients and described them on spot and gave great recommendations.   But now ‚Ä¶  Now since many people use it and many companies have bin put on the spot because of their ingredients well they some how now get payed to hush and make things still good or excellent by not including the harmful ingredients they really have .  And no longer include the right information . I finally unsubscribed and got a better app.

1,Eatme696969!,I bought Yuka 1.5 years ago for a lifetime price of $5.99 I believe it was. Now my ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù has ended and I am now supposed to pay monthly I guess. Bad business there plus I hear they have sold out to the FDA anyways and we all know they are criminals.
5,zakaryh,It‚Äôs anything I could want for free
2,CharlieGrape,I appreciate that the app connects to research about the claims they are making however the scores are missing the complicated nuances of nutrition and health. I wish it was more neutral and just informative vs making snap judgments on complex topics.

5,arizonarobbins95,Need I say more?
1,AllieBroadbent1991,"Idk if there was an update recently but for the last week or 2, it‚Äôs not giving scores for every category it‚Äôs just giving a total score and then ingredient list. What happened?! I‚Äôm a premium member so what gives?"
3,Aaliyah.b.,I like this app but i personally think that animal food and products should go on here too. Also pop daddy pretzels apple pie flavor are NOT cigarettes so kinda unfortunate i couldn't review them.
2,donaldshrimp,You would think yuca would show the harmful ingredients in native but now I find out that there is a lawsuit for their shampoo but because I used this app I thought I was buying a good shampoo which obviously is not the case!!

5,Louise027,This app rates cosmetic products and foods based on the risk their ingredients pose to our health. I love that it gives scientific sources that the app uses to generate quality scores.

5,Angkay7,usa killing its people need this now more then ever  ‚ù§Ô∏è
3,Trup135,"Overall, I like the app. I have one issue and that is that trans fats are not called out as bad on many foods I‚Äôve tried. Whereas cheese, a saturated fat is. There are so many studies debunking this."
1,Pays For It,"This looks like it would be a great app, but it‚Äôs worthless to me because I have to have a friend join in order to receive any benefit üò°. I wish they just charge me a monthly fee so I could use it."
5,myrmtolio,"This is my favorite mobile application ever. I like if more than the calculator. More than measure. More than 3D scanner. More than proton pass.   It is so beautiful.   Like a baby deer being held by its mother in a soft, fresh winter snow.   I love you Yuka.  I hope people use you."

4,CecilBlaize,"This app works wonders. It has seemingly accurate answers, also with great recommendations that I use all the time. Highly recommended! üöΩ"
5,hdmicord,The app is awesome 5 stars. I just wish the app had warnings for less talked about ingredients like soy.
5,Grumposaur Rex,"This is an amazing app. It really is! I have learned so much about the products I use daily and will start making some changes, since I learned the ones I was able to find are absolutely horrible for me. From food to cosmetic products!! I Love that you can pick how much you are able to pay for the yearly membership! I do wish there was links for the recommended alternatives of where you can buy them. But I realize that would most likely interfere with the whole independent recommendations aspect of it.  My only complaint is, once I paid for the membership and started looking up products, I noticed there are mostly French and German food products. From places like Lidl and Aldi. I assume the creator is most likely French or German, but here in the states, not a lot of places have Aldi or Lidl. I WISH where I live in Colorado, we did. I miss those stores from being born and raised for 18 years in Germany. But most of my food products are from Walmart, Safeway and King Soopers. I haven‚Äôt found any store brands from either of those places, so most of my grocery purchases I wasn‚Äôt able to look up and learn about. Also a lot of the recommendations I‚Äôm not able to find in stores because they are not in said grocery stores where I live, but other stores like Aldi and Lidl. I hope one day the more generic store brands will be added, that would make me use the app on every single item! It would be awesome if there was a place to suggest products to the developer, so they can be added. But every other aspect of this app is amazing. I‚Äôm so grateful my husband showed me and I have recommended it to everyone from family to friends! Don‚Äôt let my store brand item critique persuade you to not get the app, this app is AMAZING. I hope they will continue to expand the selection because it has already made a big difference in my overall health, with recommendations of better products and educating me on ingredients. I‚Äôll keep looking up the items I can‚Äôt find in the hopes they will show up one day!"
5,paul-1776,Recommend it for all
5,Gapo104,Great and often used app. Love it. If it would list the ingredients of the food it would be AWESOME!
5,stories94,"I freaking love this app! It has turned shopping for me into something that is full of anxiety and uncertainty into an enjoyable experience where I can be sure I trust the products I am buying and using. There are so many products that look ‚Äúorganic‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù for people but when I would go to read the ingredients it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhow do I even pronounce that word? What even is that? I don‚Äôt know‚Äù and would blindly be buying things or left looking up each ingredient in the isle on my phone and being confused and wasting so much time with my partner getting frustrated at how much time I‚Äôm taking up in the store.   With this app you can scan items bar codes and it will list out the ingredients and why they might be bad or good. What they‚Äôre commonly used for and the risk factors. I absolutely love scanning items and being able to see what is good and what is so so bad.   The only downside to this app is that it is disappointing to scan a product and see that it‚Äôs so bad for you but it makes me feel so good to know I know what I‚Äôm putting into and on my body. The best part of the app is that it‚Äôs turned shopping into a little game where I have my phone out and can scan everything and not waste any time worrying about whether or not I‚Äôm making the right choice. I‚Äôm happy and healthy and my partner is a lot happier with the amount of time we spend in the store. :) I look forward to using this app when I can and the more I use it, the more I know which products I can trust and which I can‚Äôt. :)"

1,372269429),They accept payment for higher ratings. Corrupt rating system based on how much the brand is paying Yuka. App used to be good now it‚Äôs misleading and dangerous. Thank you to all of the 1%ers trying to poison us bu any means necessary. Even acquiring this app to spread misinformation. WHAT A GREAT APP AND GREAT WORLD WE LIVE IN.

1,gddbihxzc,I thought this one could be a good right hand when shopping. It doesn‚Äôt considerate vegetable oils or difference between added sugar and natural sugars. foreaxbale it told me sweet potato fries baked in avodavdo oil was unhealthy and suggested tugalar potato chips cooked in vegetable oils. That makes zero sense. Deleted it after the first 5 foods.
5,artsycreations,It really saved me from buying bad stuff .
5,Flashliteuser,It has changed the way we purchase food and cosmetics.
5,Jaros≈ÇawE36,Just wish the app identified bioengineered foods  & corn syrup like the other ratings have mentioned.
2,NieJr,Scanned a shampoo that is known to be without bad ingredients and it came up rated poor. It listed an ingredient phenoxyethanol that isn‚Äôt even a listed ingredient on the bottle. Then another scan of a body wash that scored excellent with FRAGRANCE in the ingredient list. Misleading app!

2,hateniicknames,Not enough info to be given. Only certain things scan. Plus the only way to get some of it is refer a friend. I‚Äôll keep searching for a better app
5,MJSBOX,This app is a big help in learning what‚Äôs in your food. Klick on additives and learn what they are!
1,LynAnWil,"I have used this app to purchase skin care moisturizer. When scanned originally was very good. Now when I scan the same product I get bad or poor. Not sure what is going on, but no longer rely on this app to help me with products."
5,jackobens,This app is incredible. It has every food item imaginable.
5,Iconcur2,Thank you so much for this app. Really has helped a lot.
5,Ash'Cash,I like this app Yuka it scans my diet all the time I would have this app forever
3,ConnorXP,This used to be the best app ever for staying healthy and eating well but company‚Äôs have started bribing them for higher ratings which they‚Äôre accepting
1,MollieMilaPorter,"There‚Äôs brands listed as medium to high risk that I have done researching the ingredients myself, they are not bad for you while they list brands like L‚ÄôOr√©al as excellent ratings. They say they aren‚Äôt paid by brands but use your own common sense on this, don‚Äôt waste your money."
5,Kelli1129,Fabulous app that I tell all my friends about
2,Yfbyg y yg,Everything i own the app says its bad like what the heck?? And plus the app tells me that my im going to get a rash or its going to make my skin dry even though it does the opposite like bro are you kidding me?
5,purplehairdresser,I check everything! This app is amazing!
5,glutenfree1710,Love this app pls make a Twitter so I can tag y‚Äôall and spread the message . Thanks again

5,Jkeckrn,"This is brilliant, I use it at the store for everything! I love the healthier options!"
5,Marcartel,The only app worth paying a subscription for!
2,keysahazam,"I have an iPhone that is up To date and the app keeps crashing, it will hardly stay open to let me search!"
3,Suerhf07,The idea is great but a lot of the information entered is incorrect and there are many duplicate products.  All products should be independently verified (if entered by user) and the database needs to be purged of dups
3,Alex W1-4,I bought this mainly for seed oils but it doesn't really help for that. Maybe I just haven't figured out that option but I don't think so.
1,Gigi2003200320031234,"It skips all the dyes, maltodextrin, carrageenan , dextrose, and MSG just to make a few awful things that they as to our food. This app is useless if you really want to know good or bad you still have to read the labels to know still."
5,couldntfindausernameso,Very helpful and useful. We need more things in life like this
5,itsthatgloria,"I use this app all the time at the grocery store, it‚Äôs so helpful"
4,No GMOs for me,I use this app everyday. The only thing I would add to it is I wish it would identify if the product contained GMOs & what those GMOs are.
5,#1BasketBallGorl,The app helps you and also helps with diets like mine and I LOVE‚ù§Ô∏èit so much!!
5,TyBellaNana,Absolutely the best App I have come across!
2,crzygrl1976,This app has constant issues with scanning pictures of labels even in good lighting. It makes it frustrating to use. Looking for another app.
1,emmdiamond,"The app isn‚Äôt letting me log in. I changed my password 3 times to the same thing, even saved the password on my phone and when I go to log in the app says, ‚Äúthe email and password you entered does not match‚Äù üòí"
5,LindaRosea,Learned how bad lots of our products are!!
5,Chala D,It‚Äôs excellent  but sometimes I get good/ poor on same items.
5,ttosser,This is so helpful and helps me understand what is in the food I eat.
5,Tina Rakdat,I love this app because now I am aware what to avoid.
5,M Sells,This has been
2,montydaweasel,I have been told by many doctors to eat certain foods to address health issues and yet this app condemns those foods.  I think this app needs to adjust ratings for users based on doctor recommendations.
5,Hadassah Taveras,I am so happy and thankful to
5,jenluvv,Thank you

5,rowbunny,"Now if we can get an app like this for pets, dogs and cats,that would be  great.‚òïÔ∏è"
4,SubarumanFL,It shows items that are not in food desert like Small towns where Trader Joe‚Äôs are no where to be found.
5,Desert Nana OK,Thank you for helping me make healthy choices.
5,My husband is awesome,Absolutely LOVE this app.
1,BriMarieClem0930,Downloaded app for the first time. Prompts me to enter my log in which I do not have because I never had the app before. So I try ‚Äúforgot password?‚Äù and it actually sent me an email to reset but the link doesn‚Äôt work. UGH. SCAM.
5,Kellillek,I love this app so much. It helps me make smarter decisions with everything I wanna buy!!ü´∂
5,darn sexy,I would like to know about medicine
5,LeeH3652,"This is the best and most used app concerning our health and what we put in our bodies. Thank You, Bobby Lee"
5,JohnRandall63376,"This UE on this app should be used as a benchmark.   Scan the food. Click the additives. Read the research, see the sources of information.  My favorite feature is the additives as it links the reason and research to help you UNDERSTAND!  Bravo."
5,Bird22407,I used this to clean my kitchen pantry anything bad and below is in trash now.
5,shahsbisssnsidhsh,Great app thank you . You gave me a chance to be healthy
5,YadiGotti,To anyone who needs to know how this app works. It is basically a Pok√©dex but for real life üíØ
5,Miss Pajessa,"Educational! Informative, told all my friends about this app!"
2,E1639,"This app is amazing the only reason why I don‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt give bad points for foods with seed oils (for example: canola oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, vegetable oil) these oils are highly HIGHLY processed and highly inflammatory to the body.  Any food containing seed oils shouldn‚Äôt have a high rating.   Only use coconut olive and avocado oil! Please! Your body will thank you!  Please devs make the changes and add a warning when seed oils present!"
4,Amarra190,"I really like it, but when I invited a friend and my list is still unavailable, why?"
1,_≈í√Ç‚óä,"Forced share to access. Needs ability to flag more allergens. I can't touch ragweed (really, any aster) which is very common in cosmetics. If this would automatically mark those unsafe products, then it would be more useful. Gluten is pretty easy to spot."
5,whatthemine57,The cosmetics is a great touch.  A must have for any health conscious souls.  Stop paying for poison.  Get this app.
1,Eating disorder cause,They rate all your food as good/bad but you can‚Äôt adjust the metrics to what your criteria. They also say if you have a food allergy you shouldn‚Äôt just trust it and have to read the labels anyways. Not a fan at all!
5,Happy 1996,Thank you so much for this perfect App!! It‚Äôs so much FUN !!  I have told so many people about  this app  it‚Äôs the Best!!!!

5,35535764488423389623,Great app! Just doesn‚Äôt rate detergents and fabric softeners for some reason.
2,limacast123,"These can contain up to 3000 ingredients, so I‚Äôve read.  Ingredients which they don‚Äôt have to disclose to us.  I try my best to avoid products with parfum/fragrance in it so I wonder why they are given high scores on this app."
1,Kvans81,I‚Äôve been at this clean lifestyle for 12 years now and knowing specific products are clean and seeing them labeled as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù on this app is laughable.  Who‚Äôs in charge of uploading products and then rating them?
5,shauntalley,Helps me make better choices in the store
5,dj__jazzy,I use this app all the time for everything! I love it!
5,La petite coquette nyc,I love this app. It is very informative and helps me eat clean! Thank you for keeping me informed.
3,hi there ^^,It‚Äôs pretty cool but it won‚Äôt let me add any of the products I have at home that they don‚Äôt have. Apparently every picture i take (good or bad) is not readable and invalidated  :(

1,M4T7H3W234,"I scanned 5 items and couldn‚Äôt get a rating for any of them. While I think this is a helpful tool, it really needs to be built out to encompass more products."
1,Marie2325,I paid for the upgraded version and I got a new iPhone now I no longer have it ?? But I‚Äôve got the emails stating I purchased for the year and tried using that email.
5,Gazareid,I love this app. It changed my life.
5,buddyrocker2,Thank you for creating this app! I had no idea most of the products I‚Äôve used are hazardous!
5,Ngiculelasasa1,I make all natural soaps and this has helped me so much and helped my eating habits
5,uber-,i have very sensitive and irritable skin so its really helpful to see what alls in my skincare products. before i would just have to try them on myself and that doesnt go so well. but i highly recommend this app for anyone !!!
5,Tae451,Highly recommend this app to anyone!
5,TG676,Best app ever! I use it for everything from groceries to cosmetics! Keep up the good work!
4,knewman101,"My only question is when are they gonna add more of all the bad ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, maltodextrin etc‚Ä¶"
1,NickiKnows,App has multiple entries for same product and gives them different ratings. WTH. Same product rated as bad and good. App data seems to be full of incorrect information.
5,Pointgodnas93,I literally love this app I enjoy everything about it

LEAVE ME ALONE!"
2,Tone James,"I like how it tells you the risk with the additives, but it doesn‚Äôt put (risk) when it reads all the seed oils in foods that have already had study‚Äôs proven how bad it is for your body"
1,Travis Bush,It‚Äôs apparent that this app is out of date with its nutritional information.  Unless you‚Äôre a vegan that eats soy.  This app will tell you that beef is bad but vegan beef is better which is a proven lie. Saturated fat is not the enemy either. So if you‚Äôre a soy boy then enjoy the app.

1,dissipatedfog,"Wouldn‚Äôt let me sign up with DuckDuckGo email, said it was invalid. The only reason to do that is because they only will let you use an email that allows them to attach trackers. Nope."
1,michelemarie10779111,"Many products have the wrong ingredients (probably because they were reformulated) and the app does not account for that, so a lot of the ratings could be incorrect."
3,Beca_B,"There are brands with white or colored barcodes, and it won‚Äôt scan those. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good app"
5,zJnhJames,So amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to see how the app develops.
5,Happygolucky25,"I downloaded this app after years of dry, sensitive skin with cystic acne and eczema that wouldn‚Äôt go away.  One of the things I learned right away was that an ingredient that‚Äôs in almost every cleansing product can cause eyelid and neck eczema, which was exactly where my eczema patches were. I decided to cut out all ingredients that sensitize, cause allergies, or eczema (which was challenging to find but I have).  What is amazing is that over the last 6 months, my skin looks years younger, is not longer dry and itchy call eczema patches have gone away and stayed away without use of medication, my knuckles don‚Äôt crack all the time even in January in a bitterly cold climate, and perhaps best of all, I have now gone months without any cystic acne, which hasn‚Äôt happened since college.  I used public restroom soap for a day of travel, and redness and dryness started to come back on my hands, so I now carry my own travel bottle of soap in my purse.  I feel and look so much healthier and had no idea how many products contained problematic ingredients for my skin.  I also have been slowly changing our diet with the food side of the app, which has been eye opening as well.  Another family member using this app has also experienced similar results with her skin issues that are similar to mine.  If you have skin issues, this app is for you! I can‚Äôt tell you how often this winter I‚Äôve seriously just marveled over how not dry my hands are, how smooth my skin is, how clear my face is, or how not red my skin is!  Thank you Yuka üòä"

5,Get Nourishment,Amazing app. Finally I can help my clients with what foods will benefit their bodies for healthier lifestyle. Thank you YuKa Team.
4,03lake,"So, this app has been a lifesaver. I‚Äôve been trying to get healthier products for a while; it‚Äôs really intimidating to be faced with an ingredient list and have to look up items one by one or try to rely on articles which you‚Äôre worried are getting kickback from specific brands to advertise. Crazy, I know, but sometimes you have to do it. What absolutely SOLD me on this app was when I scanned my skincare products that were dermatologist recommended, a safe bet you‚Äôd think, and it came up that some of the ingredients are carcinogenic! I was shocked to find out the CeraVe I was using for my mild eczema could potentially cause cancer. I used these products daily but the second I learned that it was thrown in the trash. The best feature on the app is that it recommends better products for you- it showed me Cetaphil for a different skincare product and now I use that daily with peace of mind. It will also tell you when a product has a recall on it if you‚Äôve previously scanned it. My Dove ry shampoo took a dive to the trashcan when I saw that. I‚Äôve used this for food items too; I eat a lot of trail mix as a snack thinking nuts and berries are innately healthy but most of them have a lot of additives. Who would‚Äôve thought? Bonus, the suggested item ended up being more delicious than my previous go to. It‚Äôs a little bit of a shock at first and I guarantee you might get a little stressed and start scanning everything in your bathroom/kitchen like a maniac. But, the suggestions will make you feel informed and empowered to make those healthy substitutions a little at a time. Plus, if you do have a guilty pleasure food/cosmetic that‚Äôs not the healthiest you don‚Äôt feel so bad for eating it knowing you have other healthier items that balance it out. My one qualm is if you scan something and it has a high enough score the app doesn‚Äôt suggest other products to you anymore. I like having options, sometimes I want to try new products and I don‚Äôt want to have for find a potentially unhealthy one in order to see those suggestions. Being able to scroll to the bottom and see suggestions instead of backtracking is nice. I paid for the premium features after a few months of using cause the company really deserved it for making something so phenomenal and I wanted the search capability. The search helps to look up specific products without a barcode; but, when looking up products the search bar isn‚Äôt the best when it comes general names for items. For example, I‚Äôve realized you get better results if you have specific product names like ‚ÄúAussie Freeze Spray‚Äù instead of general terms like ‚ÄúHairspray‚Äù. Very small issue but I‚Äôd love to see the change. Overall, it‚Äôs a great app to have. I recommend it to pretty much everyone I talk to and the people I know who have tried it have loved it just as much as I do. Thank you so much Yuka!"

1,Joey_312,"This app is a full on scam, it will tell you perfectly good skin care products are hazardous. Theres plenty of information online about how this app is completely inaccurate."
4,Listen or not,"This app is fantastic. I found that the majority of my favorite easy foods like Amy‚Äôs black bean enchiladas were excellent, but not all Amy‚Äôs are , but I only eat that one , but I assumed that they were all good . I was surprised they are not. While on the isle I scanned other brands  I have bought in the past,  like boomerang, Not good and my favorite Fairlife chocolate milk not so great ! But you don‚Äôt have to skip everything it alerts on, it‚Äôs great you can  see what it is, sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as sodium. So if that‚Äôs not an issue for you or you don‚Äôt buy premade foods too often  , it not the end of the world.  It can get very depressing when you start realizing how most of the foods in the store you should skip . If you don‚Äôt have time to always cook from scratch it‚Äôs really difficult . But not impossible and this app is great for people like me that read labels and pretty much know what‚Äôs BAD, but this is just another great tool to help me avoid the garage food makers are trying to sneak in on us . This app is an absolute must for people that have yet to learn what to avoid , so it‚Äôs a great learning app too. I believe if we all SAID NO  to buying poison foods full of chemicals and otherwise just unhealthful foods, stores would stop caring the stuff that sits on the shelf and expires, and the companies that make it, may make some changes . Look how many items now DONT have high fructose corn syrup.  We must all take a stand and demand better products . Because let‚Äôs face it , not everyone can make it all fresh everyday and it‚Äôs hard to even trust that sometimes . Thank you for this app. In the USA we have a big health crises going on because of BAD additives unchecked for so long . We need apps like this one makes it so easy to just say NO!"

3,jbphouston1,"This app is a fantastic concept that could make it easier and faster to quickly understand which products you want to use/consume. It can be helpful to raise awareness or to provide insight into items you may want to further research. However, I found a potential serious flaw. I became a member and searched for a particular CC cream product. It came up 3 times. 2 with a ‚Äúbad‚Äù designation and one with a green light or ‚Äúgood‚Äù. Same product. The app is set up so that if a product is not found, the user enters the information manually and then it immediately assigns a rating. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have a fact checking system or a way to ensure the ingredients are entered correctly, so that if a harmful ingredient is omitted when the product is entered, it completely invalidates the product rating and it can be labeled as ‚Äúgood‚Äù when in fact, it may have potentially toxic ingredients. Also, I don‚Äôt know how it handles products whose ingredients may be reformulated, which may be another reason why a product may appear more than once. In order for this app to be truly reliable for me, I need to be able to trust the source of the information. This app could be extremely useful if there was a stringent fact/error checking process in place as well as a way to ensure the information contained in products is updated in a timely manner when they are reformulated. I did report the above mentioned discrepancy to the developer in hopes they will take the feedback and improve the app, as this is something with the potential to be extremely helpful for consumers that want to make better choices for their heath."

3,laurenvwood,"I love this app for it‚Äôs features related to skincare & makeup, but for food‚Ä¶ not so much. I wish they would allow users to adjust which aspects of their scoring method were shown. They already break down their score into nutrition, additives, and organic, so it wouldn‚Äôt take much to allow users to toggle on/off for which factors are factored into the score, even with no adjustment to what is shown after clicking on the product, ie. still showing the nutrition recommendations. For example, I would prefer to only have the score factor in additives, as it does for skincare. I, like many people, have unique dietary needs that their nutrition research doesn‚Äôt coordinate with. The research used comes from a one sided weight loss perspective and as someone underweight who struggles to eat enough, the scoring is vastly contradictory to my actual needs and it‚Äôs frustrating that the don‚Äôt simply allow users to use the skincare scoring method for food or adjust what is factored in the food score. If these changes were made I‚Äôd probably be a lifelong user as I frequently try new foods, but if not I will probably cancel my subscription after curating a skincare/makeup regimen with clean products.  *UPDATE: After reading other reviews similar complaints about the nutrition scoring are brought up again, and again. This seems like the developer is dead set on what they think is the best scoring method, rather than the preferences and needs of the paying customers that continue to be shared."

3,Camnero,"The Yuka app aims to demystify the health and environmental implications of products by providing users with an easy-to-understand rating system. At its core, the app is a valuable tool for those looking to make more informed choices about the foods they eat and the products they use daily. By scanning barcodes, users receive immediate feedback on the healthfulness of a product, along with detailed information on ingredients and nutritional content. However, while the concept behind Yuka is promising, the execution leaves room for improvement. A significant concern is the app‚Äôs recommendation system. On several occasions, the alternatives suggested by Yuka for products deemed ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô have been questionable. These recommended products, at times, contain higher levels of sodium, added sugars, or other ingredients that many would consider being less than ideal for a healthier alternative. This inconsistency can be confusing, especially for users relying on Yuka to guide them towards healthier choices. Moreover, the app‚Äôs algorithm, which underpins these recommendations, seems to prioritize certain health aspects over others, without a clear explanation of why. This lack of transparency can undermine the user‚Äôs trust in the app‚Äôs recommendations, as it‚Äôs not always evident why one product is favored over another, especially when the suggested alternative appears to have a similar or even worse nutritional profile. Despite these criticisms, Yuka‚Äôs user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible even for those who are not tech-savvy. The database of products is expansive, covering a wide range of food items and cosmetics, which is a testament to the app‚Äôs ambition to be a comprehensive health resource. In conclusion, while Yuka offers a novel approach to health and wellness through its product scanning and rating system, users should approach its recommendations with a degree of skepticism. It‚Äôs essential to look beyond the app‚Äôs ratings and delve deeper into the nutritional content and ingredient list of both the scanned products and their suggested alternatives. As with any tool intended to aid in making healthier choices, Yuka works best when complemented with personal research and, if possible, consultation with a healthcare professional."

1,dont trust app,"Personally just from what I have seen and read about you don‚Äôt take into account the amount that is in the product because with many things if it is just in moderate amount it cannot do any damage but many of your ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù and ‚Äúmoderate risks‚Äù seem overly rated just because it has shown to be harmful in large amounts or risks when it‚Äôs used the wrong way like a lotion could have a certain chemical you flag as high risk and yet it‚Äôs if it‚Äôs ingested that it can hurt you. Would highly recommend searching more into the chemicals so people get fully factual information and make a way that you are able to give a warning underneath chemical in question as in ‚Äúharmful if ingested.‚Äù Seriously just be more specific cause this app is basically making people panic and has shown to be counterintuitive because people believe it‚Äôs a replacement towards an actual doctor as in example, a woman went to her dermatologist and he suggested a few products, about a month or two later she comes back and it‚Äôs even worse and claims she used this app on the products and saw they were ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù so got things that said they were low risk. You seriously need to put warnings on this app because people think it‚Äôs 100% accurate and you have generally no information about this person and how their skin type, acne, basically anything is like and can be easily saying things that do not fit that person needs is a good product to buy therefore they do and it does damage so maybe try adding a user interface and or survey to properly understand what may be high risk and low risk to the specific individual."

5,not Aaron G,"Hello community of Yuka,  I am a consistent user of Yuka and a premium member. Thank you so much for this app. In a time of corruption in brand deals, advertisements, and data sharing, you have stayed to your roots and have not put profits over your morality. Thank you. I am a member because I support and believe in your project, not because I care about the benefits. But enough with that, let‚Äôs get to the point. I am writing to you to make some suggestions on how you can improve your app and stand out from your competitors.   It would be incredible if you would consider a company‚Äôs ethical practices in your analysis of food products. Many products (such as products of Nestle and any major cocoa corporation that uses child labor to make their products and many major banana corporations in Ecuador) are known to have unethical labor practices in their production but it still shows them at 100% green (which can be misleading). The ethical rating obviously should not be completely factored in to the red-green healthiness scale of a product and therefore should probably be in its own category, maybe at the bottom of the analysis under negatives or positives of the product. Obviously, this task would require a lot more research into companies and their products, but a feature like this is incredibly unique, sought after, and aligns with your brand. Like I mentioned before, it will also make you stand out from your competitors and you should really consider adding it if you want this project to grow. No one has ever done anything like this before, you can be the frontiers of a safer more just society.  Furthermore, You could also consider using AI to help your app become more reliable and accurate (just something to consider) in its analysis and recommendations.   Please take the time to consider these ideas. You have already done so much incredible work for humanity with this app, and it is only up from here. Thanks for all that you do,  Aaron Gill"

1,Doesn‚Äôt know anything,It doesn‚Äôt scan alot of stuff
1,sbmickyblue,"I was amazed at how ignorant this app was, I scanned several different products, some that are very healthy and some that are not, and it said some of the unhealthy stuff was more healthy than the healthy stuff. Case in point, I compared several different products. Nature valley roasted almond granola bar vs yes bar salted pecan. The nature valley ranked higher. Despite the fact it‚Äôs not organic, it‚Äôs GMO, has 3x more sugar and carbs. But the yes bar got a bad rating because it had slightly more calories (20) and a bit more fat. Also simple mills seed flour crackers got a low score. But the nut thin white rice cracker got a score double that in the 80s. Despite the fact the rice crackers have WAY more carbs. But again it dinged the simple mills for slightly more fat. For anyone with blood sugar issues, might see that and think the white rice crackers are better when in fact they will spike the blood significantly more. This app is extremely dangerous for health conscious people. Everyone should do their own research instead of relying on the recommendations of other people who do blanket one size fit all recommendations for them. The final nail in the coffin came when I was comparing some nutritional products that contain stevia. And it said it was dangerous according to the European Union, it takes you to a link supposedly talking about how dangerous it is, which is just a link to the website, with no reference anywhere saying how bad it is. And the extra final nail came on some nutritional products saying some of the vitamins were dangerous, when in fact there are several different forms of the same ingredients, whether that‚Äôs animal, synthetic or plant based, but it doesn‚Äôt differentiate the difference, and makes a blanket statement saying that it‚Äôs dangerous. This is extreme misinformation. I don‚Äôt know how this company hasn‚Äôt been sued yet. If you want to have a laugh, go down your grocery store aisle, go to the health food section but also go to the junk food section, and you will be a surprised by how junk food will get a better score than the health food. I can recommend this app as a joke, but I cannot recommend this app for anyone who is trying to improve their health.  Update : I appreciate yuka responding but they didn‚Äôt explain why they claim stevia to be dangerous. To say whether something is healthy is dependent on serving size, has nothing to do with saying something like stevia is dangerous when there is no claims anywhere saying it‚Äôs dangerous. Their reason for saying it‚Äôs dangerous is according to the European Union, where they give a link to the EU website. Which has no reference material to anything. But when you search the EU website you will find how safe stevia is. I have met some people who are basing all their nutrition advice on this app and they are making some really questionable choices because of this app. I don‚Äôt appreciate companies who spread misinformation or out right lies. The EWG is famous for making claims about certain ingredients, based on misunderstanding of current scientific evidence and then making blanket statements for something when things were taken out of context.  This app seems to be doing something similar and still can‚Äôt recommend it."

5,lesliew508,"As a bariatric surgery patient determined to maintain their weight loss, I was intrigued when I stumbled upon the Yuka app. Intrigued by its promise to help me navigate the complexities of the food industry, I embarked on a scanning mission at my local Walmart.  **Scanning the Food Landscape**  To my horror and delight, the Yuka app revealed the hidden sugars and unhealthy ingredients lurking in many supposedly 'healthy' foods. The app's intuitive interface and personalized recommendations guided me towards healthier alternatives, empowering me to make informed choices. Pricey ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù granola was actually one of the worst options! I was very pleased that some of the healthier things the app chose were better for my budget!  **The Power of Premium**  While the free version of the app is valuable, I found the premium upgrade to be indispensable. The ability to access recommended products, filter preferences, and track my food intake with greater precision has been instrumental in my ongoing weight loss journey.  **Beyond Food**  Impressively, Yuka extends its reach beyond food to include beauty products. This holistic approach allows me to make healthier choices for my entire body, from the inside out.  **Conclusion**  The Yuka app is an invaluable tool for health-conscious consumers. Its comprehensive database, personalized recommendations, and user-friendly interface have revolutionized the way I make food and beauty choices. Whether you're looking to lose weight, manage a chronic condition, or simply improve your overall well-being, I highly recommend this app. It's a game-changer that will empower you to make healthier decisions for a brighter and healthier future"

4,Kay Dee You,"I‚Äôm slowly trying to detox my personal care items, as I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with PCOS and have struggled to conceive for a few years. I just got the premium version, and I love being able to search products when they come to mind, not just when I‚Äôm standing in a store.  I‚Äôve heard that EWG‚Äôs Skin Deep database, while free, is somewhat biased because brands pay to be EWG verified. I like that there‚Äôs no pay for play here!   I like the clear explanations of problematic ingredients in personal care products.  I‚Äôm less impressed by the nutritional ratings, but I know that the nutritional advice that ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù people tend to follow is 1) widely varied (Plant based everything vs carnivore vs paleo, etc.) and 2) not necessarily in step with the official guidelines that the FDA would recommend. (This app‚Äôs target audience probably has deep distrust for the Food Pyramid, for instance, but what are the developers going to do? Base their guidelines off Dr. Cate Shannahan or RFK jr.? I mean, I‚Äôd love that, but I can see why they can‚Äôt do that.)  For instance: The app considers canola oil a 0/100 no-risk food. Yikes!    I‚Äôll be taking the nutritional advice with a grain of salt (and I mean that literally, because we are a salt-loving family unconcerned with our sodium intake). We mostly eat whole foods anyway; I‚Äôm not going to get hung up on the fact that they rate ground beef ‚ÄúPoor‚Äù and vegetable oil ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù because I‚Äôm more concerned about oxidative stress than I am about saturated fat.  That being said, even though I primarily plan to use this for non-food items, I will definitely use the nutrition functionality when I‚Äôm making my shopping list ‚Äî beyond seed oils and sugar, there are a lot of other ingredients that I would like to avoid whose names and effects I am not familiar with yet, so for that, Yuka is a life saver."
3,JGN1981,"After being a paid subscriber for two years, we‚Äôve reverted back to the free-to-use version. The concept is great, but the reality is that the information is too unreliable to pay for. Over those two years, I found myself submitting product corrections all the time. After dozens of emails, and dozens of ‚Äòthank you‚Äôs from support, I realized that I was paying to use a product while also working on that product for the company. I‚Äôm not going to be an employee building an app AND pay for it at the same time.  I‚Äôd double-check products flagged as ‚Äútoo salty‚Äù or ‚Äútoo sugary,‚Äù just for the packaging to show completely different numbers. Calories are off as well, and probably other values too. Not all the time, but often enough to fracture my trust in the data. Products are often flagged as ‚Äúnot vegan‚Äù that really are. They‚Äôll say ‚Äúvegan‚Äù right on the packaging, yet Yuka‚Äôs algorithm somehow flags them incorrectly. The first few times I submitted corrections I was hopeful they‚Äôd figure out the root cause and address it. But a year into sending emails, I gave up. I imagine their other dietary flags have similar inconsistencies. My assumption is that Yuka has a robust process to ingest new products to their library but a much less reliable method for updating those products. It‚Äôs either that, or there is a much larger flaw causing those nutritional panels to be inaccurately processed right out of the gate. I hope they‚Äôre not relying solely on user submissions to update millions of products because that is going to leave their data riddled with gaps. People want to use Yuka as a quick and trusted method for vetting products, not to constantly double-guess what the app provides, reading packaging anyway, and submitting countless email updates to do the company‚Äôs job for them. You could argue that Yuka stills helps by flagging hazardous additives, but honestly, this is still much more work than just reading the nutritional panel and interpreting it ourselves.  That‚Äôs it in a nutshell. My family still uses Yuka, but we take the numbers with a grain of salt. Like a baseline interpretation. For example, if Yuka scores something as a 0-10, then yeah, it‚Äôs probably a good item to skip or limit. But if Yuka has something at 40 or 50 because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo salty‚Äù or ‚Äútoo sugary,‚Äù I might not worry about that as much because there‚Äôs a solid chance that the sugar and sodium numbers are wrong. We also do not trust the vegan/not vegan label.   They could really drive up the integrity of their data by offering free premium to users who submit updates. I‚Äôd consider that a pretty fair trade. ‚ÄúUpdate 100 incorrect products in a year and your year‚Äôs subscription is free.‚Äù Something like that. It gives them data which they desperately need, improving the app, while encouraging users to continue using Yuka. When a time comes that the data is insanely accurate and there is no longer a need for user support to keep products up to date, perhaps after finding a better method to tend to their listings, then they can stop giving out free memberships.   Just my thoughts. Our grocery shopping used to live and die by Yuka ratings, until we realized those ratings were off. The good news is that the issues are definitely something that can be fixed. Presuming the company wants to do so."

1,ahjskfjfjsjakdkg,Banned for no reason
3,MrsCSC,When I downloaded this app I was a huge fan immediately and couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. I have been in the process of transitioning things for years to healthier options. Especially because it makes a difference for me health wise (sensitive skin and stomach). I told everyone about it and we‚Äôll no one was really as excited as I was lol. But you could basically call me their advocate lol. My husband now asks me to scan stuff as well. So simple to use although I did have an issue when things were not entering correctly which was a bit annoying especially when shopping.  The reason for the three stars was the lack of integrity for me. Not sure if that‚Äôs the right word but I was a bit disappointed. Yuka sent out an email sharing that they were hiring and wanted to know if I was interested. I immediately responded that I was surely interested. I was so excited to be apart of this company and to get paid for something I actually enjoyed doing. Not only that it was the perfect job opportunity for me as a SAHM. It was PERFECT. I then received an email stating ‚Äúthanks for your application and interest in helping Yuka grow‚Äù then it proceeded with the details about the position. I then again informed them I wanted the job and asked questions concerning what they sent me so I could be sure to have the right information they were asking for. Well I get an email stating that the position is no longer available. Although they made it seem like it was and that I got to them in time. I had most if not all the details concerning the position which I only received after stating I wanted the job.   They told me to tell others about it to see if they would like to join the team as well. How they needed workers and were hiring. I was watching my inbox waiting to get the great news of when to start etc. I told my sister and husband about it and they were so happy for me because they knew how much I loved the app and using it. I was excited  for nothing and wish they would have informed me sooner. Because I didn‚Äôt hear back from them until my second message saying hope to hear back from you all soon. The they could have done was replied to the first message. But as of now I don‚Äôt use the app as much.   I still like the app and use it sparingly but that really disappointed me. They did throw in that maybe next time but I wish they honored their email to me to which seemed as though they were giving me the job. This surely left a bad taste for me with this company. None of it made sense nor did they try to explain it. That probably would have helped some but better yet they could have just honored their word.

3,Salbertsen000001,"Alright, let me start out with the good. This app shows promise and is going to be incredibly useful for me as I‚Äôm moving towards a healthier food journey. I count calories and macros in order to meet my fitness goals everyday 24/7. I‚Äôm starting to let go of nearly all processed food so this is an incredibly useful tool to weed out food with additives while shopping. It also gives me a breakdown of why some qualities in different foods can be incredibly harmful. It‚Äôs very informative and I will be using it a lot.  However‚Ä¶ there are a few things that bug me. Terms like ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù, ‚Äútoo fatty, ‚Äútoo sugary‚Äù are pretty subjective from person to person. I don‚Äôt believe that should be a bash against any food.  These descriptions are problematic for a lot of reasons. I‚Äôll give a few examples:  Some Hu brand chocolate bars have a bad rating because they are too caloric, too fatty, and too sugary. Hu chocolate is artificial sweetener free, soy free, organic, minimally processed etc. Why would you give it such a bad rating for those few things?  What if I only eat one square and it‚Äôs only about 50 calories or so and is within my daily caloric intake? What if someone is trying to bulk and needs to pack in the calories so they NEED something highly caloric? What if I‚Äôm trying to meet my fat macro for the day and just need a square or two? What if I eat under 50 grams of sugar a day and I can indulge myself with a small bit of chocolate just to let loose a bit(not to mention that it is coconut sugar which is a far better alternative to aspartame etc).  Is that one square of chocolate suddenly awful even though it doesn‚Äôt have any additives, artificial sugars, dyes etc? It‚Äôs rated nearly the same as Diet Coke! That‚Äôs ridiculous! That‚Äôs just one example.  It‚Äôs pretty sad to think that someone would choose to put Diet Coke in their body instead of a minimally processed square of chocolate based on a few words‚Ä¶. However, there is a lot of promise to this app and it still is extremely helpful, it would just be nice if there were a few asterisks over several ‚Äúpoor‚Äù choices."
5,DinaGonz13,Great app.  I love it.
5,wlihelmina,Need glycemic index reviewed
3,Eeliahsavor,"This app is wonderful for people who want to find harmful chemicals in their food and beauty products as well as learn about the affects they have in their bodies. I have a poor immune system and have suffered from food and beauty products alike that cause inflammation and irritation. I frequently worry about what I‚Äôm eating and products I put use on my body, so I was so happy to find this app that easily tells me the bad ingredients of items by scanning a simple barcode.   I started using this app and immediately cleaned out my pantry and my bathroom with all of the cancerous and irritant food/beauty products. I was really surprised to find that almost all of my beauty products were terrible, but I‚Äôm glad that Yuca gave suggestions for better products that I can replace them with.   The only issue I have with this app is that the alternative recommended products sometimes actually do not have excellent scores and have terrible chemicals. Let me explain‚Ä¶ people in other countries are using this app and have entered products into the app. Certain European countries have banned many harmful chemical additives and preservatives in their products. America and other countries have not made the effort to ban some of these additives.   When someone in another country scans a product that is sold in multiple countries and then someone in, for example, America sees that it has an excellent score and goes to buy it they will be buying a bad product because of this issue. If the apps creators can take that into consideration and put a warning or a section discussing which country the product was scanned in so that Yuca‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt recommend things that don‚Äôt actually match ingredient wise."

3,Bernski9,It only sees the Nutritional Facts not any of the pesticides
3,Kim$7,"For example, Quaker Oats simply granola is a top recommendation. The fourth ingredient in this is vegetable oils, canola, and or soybean oil. This is a big fail. I deleted the app.   Edit: I received a reasonable response which I copied below my edit. Given the data being exposed about the inflammation and its contribution to chronic illness caused by un-natural oils, other ingredients unnecessarily added to US foods, and processed foods, if in future updates, users can flag certain ingredients based on their preferences, or knowledge, that will make this a more useful app. I‚Äôll download and try again.  From the developer  ‚Äú thanks for your comment! Based on current research, the health impact of oils isn‚Äôt just about the type of oil but also about the quantity and the types of fatty acids, along with how they‚Äôre processed and the heat applied during cooking. Omega-6 fatty acids, commonly found in seed and vegetable oils, can easily oxidize when exposed to heat, light, or oxygen for too long. This oxidation can lead to potential health issues if consumed in large amounts. Since Yuka doesn‚Äôt have access to these oxidation details, we focus on evaluating the nutritional content of oils rather than their condition. The extraction process is another factor, as it can sometimes result in traces of chemicals like hexane. Yuka decodes ingredient lists rather than testing for contaminants, so we rely on the information provided on labels and don‚Äôt have access to manufacturer or third-party lab data. That said, we know some of our users prefer to avoid specific oils. For this reason, we‚Äôre looking into ways to flag different types of oils in future app updates, so you can make choices that best align with your preferences. Hope this helps! ü•ï-Ileana"""

1,global governance elite,"I work for one of these major food processing companies (I won‚Äôt specify which one for fear of harm to my company) and we find this app to be extremely harmful to our business model as well as current/ future projections. We work very hard set up a regulatory environment that favors the chemical work we do and have spent billions maybe trillions between all companies that inhabit our market share in the past 50 years to lobby the United States government to exclusively legislates and regulate in our favor. This app undermines to greater good chemical work in which we have become sustainable global pioneers in. We take great pride in taking chemical, toxic and flat out corrosive or acidic compounds into our research labs and tweaking them in was to amplify whatever traits are specific to said compounds the we rename the compounds to ultimatelyPatent. Once it is registered we can now legally add it to all food we can and we add it to everything we can to harm humanity and we are constantly adding in more products daily. We have been extremely successful at loading foods with toxic and corrosive chemical compounds because we are the ones who paid to be able to write and legislate the rules for the government to follow. A successful business practice we were taught how to take advantage of do to our sustainable work relationship we share with the pharmaceutical industry in which we share a vested interest.  In short we will see that this app and the whole alternative or supplement and pro health industries will be taken out very soon. We do own the us government if you remember. You people should be thanking us for the efforts and the amount of money and people involved in the very deliberate poisoning through food and consumables. With out us just imagine the state of the pharmaceutical industries or the hospital and healthcare industries. We account for an unimaginable amount of jobs created as a result of the various issues that serious and long term corruption of the organic human body. Our work helps depopulate our planet  because at its current levels is severely overpopulated and on the brink of exhausting all of the earth‚Äôs resources that we allow you to access and once all resources that have been allotted to the populations have been consumed. Then we will have an almost world ending catastrophe to deal with. It‚Äôs not like we can allow the use of the planets vast almost limitless resources to be used be anyone anytime. So again I stress if you truly care about people and your health you will call the authorities or launch investigations in to this application and it‚Äôs weaponization of the absolute truths about what you put into your body. It‚Äôs us the made the pharmaceutical business what it‚Äôs today. Without us poisoning humanity we as Americans could never live such a luxurious life while constantly battling chronic diseases, illness and the cancerous tumors we spent years learning how to create through the use of all things un-natural toxic and chemical.   From a concerned magistrate in the global governance elite and board member of several food processing and pharmaceutical companies co-chair of the bill and Melinda gates foundation and the co chair of the open society‚Äôs foundation founded by the most honorable George Soros.   ‚ÄúHumanity is obsolete and the great decommission and replacement of humanity through sustainable  Equitable and soft-kill means will not be undone. Elite truth is the only narrative allow to be preached to the useless consumer masses.‚Äù -a truly great man and a leader among the elites of the world."

1,SultreeB,"I added two of the chocolate bars made by Raphio Chocolate, an artisan chocolate shop in Fresno, California. The two I added were:      72% Cacao Fresno Chili Olive Oil Chocolate &      72% Cacao Ghana chocolate bars They were both given a poor rating due to too much sugar, too much fat, and not organic. The bars are 2.2 ounces each and contain 8 grams of sugar per bar and 12 grams total fat per bar. There is 7 grams of saturated fat per bar and zero trans fat per bar. A serving size is one ounce which is approximately 1/2 a bar.  However, the chocolate bars were given a poor rating due to not being organic when the ingredients clearly state organic before each ingredient listed. The Gahana Chocolate bar only has 3 ingredients: organic cacao beans, organic cane sugar, and organic cacao butter. The Fresno Chili Olive Oil bar has only 4 ingredients: the 3 ingredients listed above for the Ghana bar and Organic Chili Crush Olive Oil (organic olives, organic Fresno chili). I have come to know the owners personally at the Farmers Market in Fresno and now at their shop. They have visited the farms and know the farmers from where they source their beans for making their chocolate products. They roast their own beans. Making chocolate is their passion. Their chocolate is far superior in taste and doesn‚Äôt upset my stomach like several of the suggestions given by the app (I have not sampled all of the suggestions). I know apps have their limitations, but giving a product a poor rating due to not being organic when the ingredients clearly state organic for each ingredient is unacceptable."

4,iscookie,"This app was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say for just havin started using this app I like it. I still try to still use good judgement wit it, not let it always decide n turn what I use into black and white thinking bc then I think I‚Äôll get carried away wit the app in an unhealthy way if that make sense. I like that it gives list of the ingredients. If u don‚Äôt understand all those big words you can get a little description n follow up with more research on it if u so chose. I like it gives alternative recommendations instead of it just tellin you the rating and u feelin hopeless of not being able to find other products in good standing. It allows you to entered products on you‚Äôre own if the product ur scanning has not been recognized n has no rating (which I‚Äôm a little iffy about bc that means  I feel like that‚Äôll allow other people to not give right info if for whatever they chose to do that but also no one is writing their own facts when they ask u to take pictures of the nutrition/ingredient facts on the products. So no one is making it up as they go along either).Now my only dislike or should I say WISH that they should put as a feature is scanning. I‚Äôve noticed how wit Amazon, when it comes to scanning a product they now let u take photos from ur library and upload them to find the product on their app. I think this app should invest in a feature where u if ur online shopping for food or beauty products and the photos of said products show u the barcode, u can be able to take a picture of it and upload it to Yuka to see if they are good enough. Obviously the places ur shoppin from aren‚Äôt gonna tell u so at least wit a feature like that we can have a more informed online shopping experience."
5,Will Lopez Realtor,Thank you Yuka for helping the world üåé have more of a break down on every Item you scanned as million of individuals sometimes dont know what they may be consuming and get tricked by a simple wording such as Real Juice! Pre Organic- with Yuka i read the real deal!  God bless the creator & thank you. üôèüèΩ. Also the option to entertain a healthier product just brought a smile to my face- my wife was a bit confused because half the stuff she would bring home to our kids and family- getting rating in the 6-100% or 10%-100% healthy wise.   Now! Its only 60%-100% the goal is to find out or get closets to 90-100%  once you reach this MORe Energy Feeling Healthier even my mother went from pre diabetic to normal ü•≥.  Amen blessings to you all and thank you once again   Sincerely  Will Lopez
3,Papa bear geo,"I bought Cerave facial moisturizing lotion spf 30 because it was rated excellent on this app.When I bought it and scanned it, it came up 0/100  Update. A rep from Yuka contacted me and said the product may be a different version or some of the ingredients may have changed. Neither is correct. The product is identical and the ingredients were the same.  A product shouldn‚Äôt be rated Excellent and then be rated Bad 0/100 when you buy it."

Instant updates on the go, if the product isn‚Äôt available you can add product details to help others. Great resource for determining how healthy ‚Äúalleged‚Äù healthy snacks really are. Comprehensive breakdown of ingredients good and bad. Rating scale 1-100, helps you decide whether that craving is really worth the risk. Download the app and see for yourself."
5,KingJel,"I tell everyone I know about this app. I encourage everyone to buy it please. You can only make a small donation to have full access to the app once per year.

4,Negustaf,"Seed oils are one of the worst we need to watch out for these days. My circle of friends have all gotten on this app throughout the year and agree that seed oils are the last major data gap it has. It‚Äôs a common pitfall point of conversation for us when referring the app to new friends.   In the description list, we want to see what seed oils are in it and add those seed oils to the 000/100 rating."

Anywaaaaays i love yuka ! like i scan something and it gives me nutrition thingees like how much and sugar and calories (it also gives you and overall rating ) i might say that all my products that i had except 3 were good or excellent rating. and when it told me my breath mints were bad i looked over and saw that was true. it also gave me suggestions for new breath mints they didnt even HAVE sugar. yuka, just a suggestion but could you tell me all the ingredients too i would LOVE reading all the ingredients better and not reading itsy bitsy labels,it just a suggestion though.also be aware people yuka doesnt know everything.Once i scanned mu coconut juice and it said that it was unknown product.(not that it was a really big problem) but anway sorry to take your time away i just felt like writing a review"
2,softwareEngineer3,"I bought a clay mask that scored 100/100. I even scanned this several times. SEVERAL. Just to ensure its not lying to me. I bought several clay masks.

5,CSchoen,"This food app has been extremely helpful and time saving during my grocery shopping. All I do is scan the bar code and I get all the ingredients, good and bad instantly!! No more straining my eyes to read the small ingredient list on the packages. Hopefully, one day, they will also have a category for pets and will assist us in purchasing quality dog and cat food!"
5,Jpatty1982,"This takes out the stress of grocery shopping! I can immediately make informed decisions of what to buy for my family. Sometimes I‚Äôm surprised by the results, organic doesn‚Äôt mean not processed and processed doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean unhealthy. This app really explains what is in the food and what implications that has on your health. It‚Äôs very easy to understand with the color code system and I love that if I want more information I can click to see details. Also, it gives you potential alternatives to buy if needed. It is honestly my favorite thing of 2024!"
2,joru00,I love that it does what they say they do with no weird permissions. Works great on a lot of products. But when I scanned beef tallow is have it a 30/100. Extremely questionable rating considering beef tallow is one of the healthiest things you can cook with bar none. The reason for the 30/100 was too high in saturated fats and high in calories. It‚Äôs oil‚Ä¶and saturated fats is healthy for you. This alone makes me question ratings. 2 stars
1,GK685,"Downloaded the app, asks for email, username, password. Then gives the ‚Äúoops something went wrong‚Äù error message. I can manually read the labels quicker than it takes to set up this garbage app. Deleted"
3,Ns1844,"Excellent app to understand ingredient hazardousness‚Ä¶.however it‚Äôs rating for them is off. Parabens are known to be endocrine disrupters and the app is showing a product with parabens as 90/100 (excellent). Also it doesn‚Äôt pull up seed oils as an ingredient for assessment, yet harbors on too much salt. Yes, we need to be mindful of sodium intake however to not include seed oils as an ingredient to be aware of is a bit surprising. This app has great potential, and needs so improvement for the consumer"
5,27monz,"I got this app probably a year and a half to two years ago. I can‚Äôt believe how helpful it is. It was so great that I went ahead and gave money for it even though you don‚Äôt have to. I thought something as simple as soft tacos were healthy but when I used Yuka to look at all of the soft taco shells, they were all terrible. It has really taught me to think twice about buying stuff. If I use the code scanner I‚Äôm pretty much not bringing a lot of stuff home. I am very grateful for this and I‚Äôm also grateful that they offer hair care and soap, etc. ratings. Bonus‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve gotten a few recipes sent to me and they were wonderful, very grateful. Thank you."
1,catewampus,"Did y first scan with the sweet potato chips cooked in avocado oil. Three ingredients. Gave it a 41/100 and suggested Sun Chips with seed oils, GMOs and other garbage I would not eat. Looks like an app designed to promote junk food as ok. I would never suggest or use this app. VERY misleading."
5,Bro is sus,So like I‚Äôm a young person and I‚Äôm in to skincare people make very good YouTube videos with this app like Sydney and Kass From Not enough Nelsons. So I recommend this app for people who are struggling on what food/beauty items they should use! That is my opinion btw BYEE!!<3
4,ntowl03,"I‚Äôve had the app a few days now.  I paid for the premium version so I could type in products that I couldn‚Äôt scan.   So far the food I‚Äôve scanned has realistic healthier alternatives.  Realistic as in I can buy them fairly easily.   However, many of the beauty alternative brands or product lines don‚Äôt look available in the U.S.    I knew a lot of products were more toxic in the U.S., but we really don‚Äôt have a eye cream with an SPF that has a good rating available?    For example, Eucerin is sold in the U.S., but the product line that has a good rating for eye cream with SPF is not. At least not from a site I‚Äôm comfortable ordering from. Found it on Amazon from an international third party. Same with Walmart.   I wish there was an option to select if you want the alternatives to be available for purchase in the U.S.(or country of origin of the person shopping).   Not necessarily made in the U.S. but at least available for purchase.   I really like the app and hope it can help me be healthier inside and out.  My only complaint is I want to try the beauty alternatives that have the best rating but they seem out of reach for the items I‚Äôve looked up.   Thank you for creating something to try to help others be healthier."
5,Piper Hartge,This app has helped me stay away from all those junk foods that i never thought were junk foods.This app is helpful fot on the go healthy snack or what to use in your dinner.I recommend this app to anyone who wants to get in better shape or eat healthier.
5,Rrrrrrjejejqnwnjwkwjqn,"In recent reviews, Vaseline has received a rather disheartening score of 30/100, which, given the product's longstanding reputation and widespread use, warrants a thorough examination and defense. Vaseline, a brand synonymous with petroleum jelly, has been a household staple for over a century, providing a plethora of benefits that warrant a far more favorable assessment.  Firstly, let us consider the core function of Vaseline: its utility as an occlusive agent. Vaseline's primary role is to create a barrier that locks in moisture, making it invaluable for treating and preventing dry skin. This attribute alone justifies a higher rating. The effectiveness of Vaseline in maintaining skin hydration is well-documented; it is used in various dermatological settings to help heal and protect the skin. This barrier function is essential for individuals suffering from conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or chapped skin, providing significant relief and aiding in the restoration of the skin's natural moisture balance.  Furthermore, Vaseline‚Äôs versatility extends far beyond mere moisturization. Its applications in first aid, for instance, are noteworthy. Applying Vaseline to minor cuts and scrapes can protect the wound from external contaminants and accelerate the healing process by maintaining a moist environment conducive to skin repair. This is a particularly crucial benefit, as it underscores Vaseline‚Äôs role in promoting better healing outcomes compared to dry, exposed wounds.  Critically, Vaseline‚Äôs safety profile contributes to its defense. The product is composed of 100% pure, triple-purified petroleum jelly, which is considered safe for use on the skin. The rigorous purification processes ensure that it is free from impurities and contaminants, which could otherwise pose risks. The dermatological safety of Vaseline has been supported by numerous studies and its endorsement by healthcare professionals.  It is also pertinent to address concerns regarding the environmental impact and sustainability of petroleum-based products. While it is true that petroleum jelly is derived from fossil fuels, Vaseline‚Äôs manufacturer, Unilever, has been making strides towards more sustainable practices. This includes initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of its products and improve transparency in its supply chain. The focus should be on these efforts to minimize environmental impact rather than a blanket dismissal of the product itself.  Moreover, Vaseline's affordability and accessibility are key attributes that often go unappreciated. In an era where many skincare products come with a hefty price tag, Vaseline provides an economical option without compromising effectiveness. Its wide availability ensures that individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds can benefit from its therapeutic properties.  Critics might argue that there are newer, more sophisticated products on the market with advanced formulations. While it is true that innovation in skincare is constant, the fundamental benefits of Vaseline‚Äîits barrier function, safety, and versatility‚Äîremain relevant and valuable. Newer products may offer additional features or enhancements, but Vaseline‚Äôs simplicity and reliability have stood the test of time.  In conclusion, a rating of 30/100 for Vaseline appears to overlook its numerous practical advantages and its established role in personal care. The product's ability to provide moisture retention, aid in wound healing, and offer an affordable solution to skin issues cannot be dismissed lightly. Vaseline‚Äôs longstanding reputation, coupled with its ongoing efforts to address environmental concerns, justifies a much more favorable evaluation. Thus, while it is essential to consider modern alternatives and advancements, Vaseline's enduring benefits and contributions to skin care warrant a reassessment of its merit."
1,Shadowthrone7,"I was excited to try this product. After downloading, I Iimmediately ran a test to see if the app would appropriately appropriately label a known highly unhealthy food product, namely, Crisco cooking oil. Sadly, the app gave this product a ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating of 72/100. This rating is inexcusable. I immediately cancelled my membership."
5,Encanto songs,Ok when you put in your email and password it doesn‚Äôt work also I tested on another app that costed money and use the same product to scan and this app was wrong.It took me an hour to try and sign up.The only reason I voted five stars was so you could see this and never get the app it is horrible.
5,Anonymous81936,"About two years ago, my teacher recommended this app, and I downloaded thinking ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs gonna be another one of those apps where you can do little to nothing without premium and ads will pop up all the time,‚Äù but no. I was proven wrong, and found an app that I love. Not only do I use this so much while I‚Äôm shopping, but I also recommend it to others. As I said, I do love this app, but I have a couple suggestions:  First off, can you include prices? I‚Äôm not asking for a specific price, just for maybe a vague but helpful price range from store to store. Just so that we buyers don‚Äôt feel as if we have to buy expensive items to be healthy, or as if we‚Äôre looking for the holy grail in Walmart. Or maybe common stores that have said items in stock? Don‚Äôt take me for a heckler, but I usually have to search for a while to find something that ranks 93/100.  My second suggestion is that maybe digital barcode scanning should be a thing. If your friend doesn‚Äôt trust the app or use it and sends you a picture of it and the barcode, then you can scan it and tell them the risks or rewards. And also, (don‚Äôt mind me I always use constructive criticism) some of these things need to be put into perspective. Like ice cream, we‚Äôre not always gonna find the perfect 100/100 thing in our grocery store, but some are better than others. Like, that vanilla ice cream has less additives and less calories than this one. Sure, the other one still gets a 47/100, but this one gets 23/100.   I will mention once again, I love this app, but I think it needs a few things. If you would even read this review, I would be forever grateful, but if you acknowledged my suggestions, I think this would make the app even more wonderful."

5,customer198375927,"I‚Äôve only had it for a day but this is already an amazing experience. it‚Äôs super easy to use all you do is scan the bar code and it will tell you if the food is good or bad, you can swipe up for more information on the food. this is a great tool if you want to eat healthier."

1,ChickenBakez,"Yukas #1 priority is harmful additives‚Ä¶ but that includes NECESSARY minerals too  Their biggest worry is actually: PORTION SIZE  I have multiple organic drink powders: meal replacement shakes‚Ä¶ that are labeled 18/100 simply because of portion size  Too caloric, too much sodium, too many carbs, too many vitamins  If your goal is to never work out but still lose weight, Yuka will make you feel really good about your calorie free foods‚Ä¶  But to anybody who burns more than 500 calories a day, Yuka only wants to starve you"
2,Dtseery,"It‚Äôs a good app for mindfulness of the ingredients of products, but its rating system is deeply flawed. I have scanned multiple water products which identify to have no negative additives and they only get 71/100??? I don‚Äôt think the way it rates things is appropriate. In addition to the fact that it identifies many products as having too many calories or too much sodium. When sodium is an essential mineral for survival, and a lot of research has gone into the cost/benefit analysis of high and low sodium in the diet. In addition, a person‚Äôs diet needs a certain amount of calories in a day and it always seems to identify foods with even a moderate amount of calories as a bad thing."
5,radical ford pickup,"Great app and super fast connection speed in the grocery store. Yes, it depends on where the signal is however I found that it doesn‚Äôt need that big of a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù for data so even with low data it‚Äôs fast.  2nd are the 0/100. I‚Äôve been avoiding these because you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs -40/100. I‚Äôve also found the generic store brands have higher ratings than the big business fancy ‚Äúorganic‚Äù ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù brands. I‚Äôll be there just scanning away as if I work there, doing inventory üòÇ.  Been thanking my nephew every time I talk to him about sharing this app. Permanently installed on all our family‚Äôs phones!

1,Blue Osiris 7,"You only get to use 20% or Less of the app after downloading.To get full access you have to invite friends to be on it. (explains 50 million users) Lame.  I went to the store and scanned several items. Eye drops, protein powders and the reply is ‚ÄúYuka does not rate this type of product‚Äù Don‚Äôt bother, better off just doing the research on your own and not be lazy."
1,Hulkmad88,"I thought this app was free , but come to find out that I was getting charged 13.99 a month for this app. Is it free or not. Ummmmmm."
5,Free palestine 123451245674,It rates almost everything.If it does not know it you can rate it
2,Aliveyah Washington,This app creates unwanted stress in your household.Tried it with my healthy cereal and checked the ingredients first.There were zero grams of sugar in there and 5 grams of fat.Tell me why they said there was 8 grams of sugars and 50 grams of fat!
5,Nice joy,"Very useful app help me to decide if the product is safe or not with simple scan. I learn about their history of the company very interesting done by a few friends with no cording background , taught themselves to code and create this app. What a great impact they made to the society."
3,FtheAllinaDevelopers,"Rated PB Fit peanut butter powder.  Me comes in a 30oz plastic jar, the other in a plastic resealable bag.   The jar came in as a 48/100, and the bag came in at 54/100.   They‚Äôre the exact same thing in a different package."
5,Healthy Gi,"I started using this app 5 months prior to this review. It‚Äôs so disturbing to see all the bad things you put into your body and on it and once you know you can‚Äôt not know. I ended up throwing all the bad stuff out and buying all new stuff highly approved from the app. I‚Äôve lost weight which is great but the miraculous thing here is that all of my medication dosage has decreased to the lowest dosage amount. All my bloodwork test results are now in the green. My doctor has had to lower my dosage twice already on all my medication . I have reversed my health issues by simply only eating food approved from this app. I will continue to eat food approved from here and plan on being off all medication by end of this year. I recommend paying for the higher version because it‚Äôs so much easier to search what you‚Äôre looking for by name instead of scanning the bar code, that way you can know what you‚Äôre looking for once you‚Äôre at the store. I still eat all my favorite meals all I did was change the ingredients into a healthy version. You don‚Äôt have to cut out carbs just the unsafe unhealthy ones and it will give you recommendations that are safe and healthy to continue to enjoy food you like which in the long run you will have trained yourself to eat healthy on a daily basis. It becomes your lifestyle not a diet that once you stop all the weight goes right back plus 20 lbs. The only way this app fails you is if you don‚Äôt use it. I only eat food I prepare from ingredients from this app No restaurants  I‚Äôm too scared of horrible preservatives in their ingredients that we don‚Äôt know are there. This app is the best thing that‚Äôs happened for me in a long time. Don‚Äôt think about it, just download it and go to your cupboard and bathroom and start scanning everything and throw away the bad stuff and start fresh. You will be amazed how much better your mind body and soul feels. Take your life back and get healthy! Warning don‚Äôt start scanning until you‚Äôre ready to throw it away and go the store to buy more because once you see what‚Äôs in it there‚Äôs no going back."
4,The.Realist.0010110,"I LOVED this app for awhile now but I have come to notice how some products that used to scan at like a 39/100 are now scanning in at like 93/100 and I don‚Äôt understand why‚Ä¶ also, a lot of these ingredients that I don‚Äôt even know how to pronounce used to actually be honest and say if there was a risk but now a lot of stuff is saying no risk and is in the green."
4,arguita,They rated Aquafina a 100/100 and IFYKYK like umm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs questionable.. and makes me wonder about some of the other products they rate.
4,Aaltazan1289,"I rarely give an app a 5 star rating. I‚Äôd give it 10 if I could! My mom has CKD and it‚Äôs so difficult to figure out what she can or can‚Äôt have. This has made life so much easier and things we thought were good for her turned out to be harmful! So glad I heard about this from a friend. I LOVE that you get recommendations to replace the bad items, as well as explanations in easy-to-understand language. The three people who created this app are angels! (Read about them in a welcome email) If the creators happen to read this, thank you genuinely.  2/24/24 update: my mom went to the nephrologist for testing last week, and her results came in- she no longer has kidney disease!! Everyone is shocked and excited. All she did was scan her food and avoid the things that cause CKD, and she added some light exercise to her daily routine. Lost 35 lbs and healed her kidneys. This app is just amazing. Thank you for creating this!!!"
3,Idk what this for,"So I got this from my bff basically and I got it. but when I see that some products are not coming up in the search bar I get frustrated like how am I supposed know if the brand is good or not??????? Like for example let‚Äôs say I copy and pasted something from Amazon right but it says something like no results if I remember correctly like i don‚Äôt know if it is because my monthly subscription maybe I need to pay more?????? Also this is just feedback to make the app better why is the NO skincare suggestions on the tops and NO food on what should you get also NO body care. For the the skincare it should put everything thing of skincare like moisturizer, serums, and cleanser. But you get the point. And for the food on what you should get I feel like you can make it better by show me what you look like maybe??? Cause your already putting the bar code thingy so why not a weight loss thing (I know this isn‚Äôt a fitness app but I think it will help) and for body care maybe put things that will help for glowing skin but this is a very good app tho  cause most of the things a search come up if you want to make it better try putting something from a diff country‚Äôs I love your app it‚Äôs really fun to play with so in the future you can try good products and not bad anymore  I hope this isn‚Äôt too bossy I‚Äôm just being honest"
3,13 Swifty,It is bad because my dermatologist recommended my skin care stuff and it‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs bad for my skin and yeah so this is why you should not get it.it is just so bad and it‚Äôs lying and saying the stuff that I use is really bad for my skin when I use it so much
1,278439,"I really do not like this app. It demonizes very healthy foods by ranking them low based on a nebulous data. Nuts are a 30/100? I see why this could be good for highly processed foods, but developers need to increase the depth of nutritional data so consumers can make more informed decisions!"
1,05Mac,Yuck is right ! Got this app hoping it would help steer me away from GMO‚Äôs highly processed foods with poor ingredients. The scanner shows this can of Tuna 90/100 excellent ! It‚Äôs some tuna that looks like it went through a food processor some kind of liquid mess. Little tiny bits of tuna and some kind of modified soy puss in a can of water. I know YUKA doesn‚Äôt make this tuna concoction but obviously they didn‚Äôt look at it either.
5,Peterbell677,"Please update your app, it is using the wrong camera. I can use my iPhone camera and it sees the bar code crystal clear, you app does not so it is difficult to scan products"
1,sblythe3,"I really love the ease of use of the app and the goal of finding safer products, but the accuracy is not great. I have found several products with ingredients missing. I let customer service know and they respond quickly and update the product.. but it has left me unable to trust this resource. I almost purchased products because of the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù 100/100 rating, only to double check ingredients, realize the worst were missing, and now the product is listed as ‚Äúbad‚Äù 10/100. This was supposed to cut time in researching products, but sadly isn‚Äôt efficient."
5,benjivreeman,"Love the app! So helpful when shopping.  There‚Äôs one change I would make. I love the fact that the app gives you a quick 0 to 100 score on the item you scanned. While I do think this is great, I would add a second score. You could scan a food item that is made with high-quality ingredients, but because it‚Äôs high in sugar, or high in some other factor like calories, it could score low on the Yuka score chart. I would add a second score that is only a ‚Äúsafety score‚Äù for food. for example, a jar of organic applesauce might be a 30 out of 100 because it‚Äôs too high in sugar, but could be 100/100 on the safety score, because it uses no preservatives or dyes."
3,Bubly crazy,Love this app but when I scan a bare code and it doesn't have it I usually put it in the system but most the time it says It can't put it is so that is the only thing
1,it was okk,So many incorrect ratings tricking people into not getting good products! 1 / 100 on blue takis? IT SAID THEY WERE TO SALTY?? CeraVe lotion-the best- 13 / 100 WDYM..? DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS APP!

5,Soubs37484488484,"I always worry about where I get advice from. Especially if someone claims something is ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù My mom is a registered dietitian, and every so often I go to her with a new product or piece of health advice I find. Most of the time, she‚Äôll give me a certain look and remind me what a ‚Äúfad diet‚Äù is. Then proceed to debunk every so called ‚Äúfact‚Äù I mentioned. I don‚Äôt remember how I stumbled upon Yuka, but I remember I felt hesitant and nervous to download the app. The only reason I downloaded it was because I was desperate for help. What was causing me so much trouble? I suppose I can say it was hives. So many hives. Around two years ago, I suddenly developed chronic hives. There were hives across my chest, back, shoulders, arms, and legs. My scalp and back were broken out in pustules. My scalp, face, and ears often burned. I remember frequently sitting under the faucet with cold water pouring over me to get some relief. I had no idea what was causing them, but it seemed to particularly get worse after using hair and skincare products. I tried a lot of products that claimed to be ‚Äúgood for sensitive skin,‚Äù ‚Äúnoncomedogenic,‚Äù ‚Äúhypoallergenic,‚Äù ect‚Ä¶ A lot of them strangely made me worse. Even products recommended by my dermatologist seemed to make things worse majority of the time. When I downloaded Yuka, the first thing I did was scan every single barcode I could find in my bathroom. I eliminated products less than 90/100 from my routine. In a couple days, I noticed big improvements. I still don‚Äôt know everything I am allergic to, but I know for sure now that sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate and propylene glycol are a no-go for me. I don‚Äôt know what all the ingredients that cause me discomfort are yet, but I thank Yuka for helping me. I like that I rarely break out in hives now. I like my new toothpaste doesn‚Äôt give me ulcers and that my scalp doesn‚Äôt burn with pustules now. Yuka gets a big thumbs up from me! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
5,S@n26,I never thought the food and the products I buy were bad.Until my daughter shared this app. Now I know what to stay away from when I go to the store .I stay a little bit longer at the store but it‚Äôs worth it Thank you for this amazing app
4,M.D.16,When I signed up to premium the app stated $13.98 but I was charged $16.98.  I'm in the USA and tried to send an email about this issue but it‚Äôs all in another language. Love the app other than this issue.
3,APinks9088561,"Love the ingredient review. It‚Äôs why I used the app. However, something very healthy has a 60/100 because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo caloric‚Äù or ‚Äútoo fatty‚Äù is dangerous, in my opinion. For example, I bought some bars for hiking. I checked the natural oat bar for the ingredients. It received a great score but then scored poor for being ‚Äútoo caloric.‚Äù It was 200 calories? And the app has no frame of reference for how it fits into my diet or the purpose of me eating it or or or. But it still claims it is somehow, objectively, ‚Äútoo caloric.‚Äù Makes no sense. I wish I could turn that off because, as someone recovering from an eating disorder, I don‚Äôt need to see that. Not being able to filter that input out has led me to not being able to use the app. Lame."
1,starluvr444,"Rated a mouth wash with Blue 1 and Yellow 40 as 97/100. It said that the food coloring were natural and had ""No risk"". Now I don't believe anything this app says. Food colorings are known carcinogens. Many of which contain Benzidine, 4-aminobiphenyl and 4-aminoazobenzene. Food colorings like this have also been found to cause thyroid tumors in rat studies."
1,t.rose13,"This app is great for free. But it very disappointing to see that their subscription service is misleading. If you click on the search icon, it reads, ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù and ‚ÄúNO COMMITMENT‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt true ‚ùå it only allows you 3 different types of payment options: $8.99/year, $13.99/year, $18.49/year. Obviously, you cannot ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù since there isn‚Äôt a way to type in a specific dollar amount. Additionally, there‚Äôs a commitment on the buyers side since this is a subscription service based app. This isn‚Äôt a pay one time service fee platform."

The information on the app is so shocking and eye opening, I tell everyone I meet about Yuka.  To the team, i have some suggestions to make the app even better and user friendly:  The ability to filter products by score (such as ‚Äúonly show products 100/100‚Äù or ‚Äúshow products 75-100‚Äù etc‚Ä¶) The ability to filter products by additives (for example ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt show products with harmful additives‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt show products with any additives‚Äù) Having a section of the app (or even a different app) that allows you to search additives themselves. (There have been times when a product I scanned was ‚Äúunknown‚Äù and i‚Äôve had to try to look up each additive online in hopes of finding out if it‚Äôs harmful or not) More food preference options, including specific ingredients/additives/foods.

5,Samuel523,"I am absolutely amazed by this app! As someone who is extremely paranoid about what's in my food, I often struggle to fully enjoy my meals. Reading the labels doesn't provide much help either, as I'm not familiar with half of the ingredients listed. However, when I discovered this app, everything changed for the better! It is an absolute game-changer! With a simple scan of the barcode, I instantly receive all the necessary information about the food item. The scanning process is incredibly fast as well! Plus the membership subscription is incredibly cheap, and you can choose from three different prices with no change to the membership! I can't recommend this app enough - it has earned a well-deserved five-star rating from me! Kudos to the developers! -Adderface25095"
5,Cosmetics lover,I love this app so much.this made my life so much easier.

1,Nygirlpride,"I used this app to scan all products i use i. My skin. Makeup, lotions, clensers.... Products will list excellent ratings and not have full ingredients listed leaving out the bad ones that are in it. Also it said Egyptian magis was 100/100 not harmful. i used and my face and eyes were swollen when I woke up. If you are allergic to bee pollen or bees Dont use it. i didn't know i was till I used it.  Also I scanned a product at sephora looking for good rated sunscreen and I bought what I found to have a exellent rating and when I cross checked the ingredients on the package ones were missing. an Endocrone disruptor.

The alternative recommendations for the bad items is beyond a godsend‚Ä¶.so far i recommended app to about 10+ friends and family‚Ä¶.goal is to stay healthy and be a mindful consumer which YUKA helps guide one‚Ä¶.love it."
4,The best comment purriodt,Add a way to find products by store via things like target or Amazon.
5,Lamta Boop,"This app has helped me out so much. There are things they don‚Äôt have information on, that‚Äôs ok with me I just won‚Äôt buy till they do. So now by me understanding that there is a small team busting their butt for us to know what we put in our body that can be harmful is beautiful I appreciate this to the max! I sent my family members this app my mom, dad, children, sister bothers and my cousins I also tell some people if someone happens to ask me a question about food or makeup. I love the app and for the ones that has this app and like tell people so they get the app too! And yes I became a member because it‚Äôs worth my health. Thank you Yuka!!!!!!!!"
1,jwengwis,"This app is a great idea. Being able to scan or search anything in the world and see at a glance if it‚Äôs healthy or not. However, it seems that the rating scales they use are super inaccurate. I ate something today that was all green except for two orange risks. Guess what that scored? An 18/100. Unless you‚Äôre buying and eating 100% organic, 100% dye free, 100% chemical free food and drinks, this app is going to rate anything you eat below 20. This scale that‚Äôs used is completely un-proportional. And I‚Äôve never seen anything rated 100/00, seems pointless to even have that rating if it‚Äôs never going to be used."
5,youshy679,"I love this app so much and I am addicted to scanning literally everything I buy!! It‚Äôs been so helpful for me and my family to make conscious health decisions, that I even purchased the yearly subscription for $13.99.

1,terrible@pp,"Admittedly, I didn‚Äôt even get to use this app because I bounced when I discovered that you must submit pictures to acquire info in the free version. Think about all the info that is tagged in photos these days‚Ä¶ location, time, surroundings, and the type of phone you use. Maybe you‚Äôre comfortable with the app users knowing that you own an Android and shop at Target every Tuesday; I‚Äôm not. Plus, I have no desire to sit in a store aisle scanning every product I‚Äôm considering (not to mention it‚Äôs not going to work for items you‚Äôd like to buy online). Interestingly, it appears that you can search products if you buy the premium version, so apparently you have to buy your privacy and the luxury of staying at home. I understand that ‚Äúnothing is free,‚Äù but I take issue with this app trying to sound like it‚Äôs so much more ethical than the others. It‚Äôs not. And the privacy policy is pretty vague about how your data is used. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up so others can see it.  Update: the response from the app developer still does not address why they don‚Äôt need access to your camera as long as you PAY them for the premium version. So the question remains‚Ä¶ why do you need to access my camera if you aren‚Äôt harvesting data that can be sold? Instead the app‚Äôs response is focused on account formation and accuracy (which I never said was my concern). Ask yourself, what does the app get in exchange for us to use it for ‚Äúfree?‚Äù You always pay with data."
5,Honest ratez,"This app is by far the best on the App Store, my journey in healthy products began a few years ago but let‚Äôs fast forward to now. I found this app and began changing every single bad product I own into 100% excellent products, as I began to do this I felt my body began to detoxify it self from the bad chemicals, I had and still have many new life changing things ever since making this switch, I can wake up early now, I can sleep better at night, my mood has improved, my sex life is improving, I feel more clear minded, and I‚Äôm even beginning to improve other areas of my life thanks to Yuka, I can‚Äôt stress this enough follow me on a journey like this you will never look back, keep your body clean of bad chemicals and live life!   Thank you Yuka!!!!!!"
3,Tigerlilyxo,"This thing is SO PICKY about the scores it gives. I scanned my WATER (because I had seen with my other scans how I felt like it was being harsh) and it got a 71/100‚Ä¶ for WATER. It‚Äôs informative, but I don‚Äôt know how anything gets to an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù rating. I know the app says it‚Äôs harder on liquid/drinks, but 70 on a water is still insane."
1,Concerned TX Mom,I‚Äôve had this app for less than 48 hours. In which time I‚Äôve done my own research a few  products that Yuka rates as 100/100 Excellent.  In 3 out of 3 I found concerning issues such as dangerous additives & missing ingredients that should have resulted in a low rating.  It appears that this company includes products within their app that they have done zero research on. Wouldn‚Äôt it be much better to just not have the product listed rather than providing false security to consumers?
5,Margiedvh,"I saw this app on Tic Tok . I wanted to know more of different foods since I‚Äôm diabetic. I was a little sad some of Puerto Rican variety of foods I couldn‚Äôt fine  .

4,jackiec20,"I love EVERYTHING about this app. I use it every day and I have gotten almost all my friends to download it. It‚Äôs genius and I‚Äôm grateful for this all. The only thing i would change, the app should have the ability to upload photos of barcodes in addition to the live barcode scanner. Sometimes I forget to scan stuff when I‚Äôm at stores and it would be convenient if I could have someone else take a picture of the barcode and send it to me to scan."

( Reputable company, reliable information and worth the download. 9/10)  I would just like you to know that I had just written out a very detailed, easy to read review of your app.Touching on the topic of it‚Äôs journey from a year ago to now.  I accidentally exited from the review to come back and see that it had all been erased. Frustrating to say the least.   ‚Ä¢ Honestly I have short handed this review after having my previous one erased , just because of the strides that have been within this app that have been made in a year, I give it 5 stars  ‚Ä¢ Being that I never write thorough and detailed reviews of an application unless it is to steer others away, warning them to not waste their time on it.  I‚Äôd like to ensure to those reading this that I am not an influencer, marketer, nor affiliated in any way to write the review that I had previously wrote, and am this review that I am taking the time to re-write for you all now. If one were to have read my first coherent review, they might have assumed that I got paid by your team.So maybe it‚Äôs for the best.  ‚Ä¢Firstly, I commend you for being independently funded, aside from donations.  Knowing that you are not officiated with any organizations or lobbyists that can pay to have ‚Äúgood grades‚Äù makes me feel as though I can genuinely trust your information to be reliable and true.   ‚Ä¢They hold true to the description when they state that there are no pop up adds, or hidden features that you must pay to use.   ‚Ä¢This is what led me to voluntarily donate to be a ‚Äúmember‚Äù   ‚Ä¢This app alone is worth a download. A glance at any other related app is a waste.  I‚Äôve tried several and none offer the amount of products listed a this one does.  Other apps don‚Äôt bother to give descriptions of each chemical listed, and they definitely have pop up adds.  Most of the terms and conditions of the other free applications, allow you to use their App so long as you agree that they can sell your personal data. What a great deal.   ‚Ä¢ The newly added features that you offer, such as adding of hygienic products is amazing.  I was able to identify a brand name shampoo, that I am now throwing in the trash as hazardous.   ‚Ä¢The app ranks each chemical from most to least dangerous.   ‚Ä¢This app was able to identify the hazardous chemicals that my shampoo contains, and gave easy to read descriptions of the dangers of each chemical listed. The interface makes it easy to understand what you are reading.   ‚Ä¢The app also shows whether or not the chemical is an allergen, a carcinogen , non-biodegradable, and gives in depth insight even to the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù chemical.   ‚Ä¢ Seeing as though this app began as for food only, I‚Äôm beyond happy to see that more products outside of food are being added, this makes me feel like a more educated consumer.                              ‚Ä¢END REVIEW‚Ä¢  A message to the developers and marketing team:  ‚Ä¢Fun fact : I created the original idea ,and invention for what you all now know as ‚Äú Tile‚Äù. That‚Äôs right , the little device that helps you find everything you lose. I was nine years old when I pitched it all to a company that I will not name. Well I wasn‚Äôt aware of what an NDA was, nor did I have the capital of $5,000 to patent my invention. A year goes by, and I see ‚ÄúTile‚Äù being advertised.  I‚Äôve learned my lesson there, but if you are at all interested in what I could offer to your company via marketing and generating revenue please allow me to contact you formally.   ‚Ä¢I have a detailed suggestion for branching out into certain areas of common products, that not many people are aware are dangerous. I am struck that it hasn‚Äôt yet been done. I believe that if you were to incorporate a vision of mine into your existing platform, this app alone would make news headlines. I don‚Äôt say that to dramatize either.   If not, then great work on the application. It has come a long way, and I am very happy with the information you have equipped me with."
1,Teresita13,"I have no idea whether this is a good app because I can't get in to use it. 1) It forces you to sign in to use, which, why is that even a requirement in the first place? 2) So I tried to create an account but it says my email address isn't valid. I have a sudomail.com account and I don't know if that's the issue or if it's just a general glitch. 3) And thirdly, without signing in I can't even get to a support area and can't find info in the app store either, so my only choice it seems is to leave my issues in a review. Will update the review later if these issues are resolved."
5,Kenna..!,Incredible app 100/100
2,xDRBN,"App works pretty well, the scoring system isn‚Äôt accurate at all. But it‚Äôs nice to be able to see ingredients and additives in things. Scoring just isn‚Äôt very accurate, just scan a few things in your panty/fridge and you‚Äôll see scores that just don‚Äôt make sense. You‚Äôll have something with low calories, high protein, low sodium, high fiber, but gets a 35/100. Then you can scan something else that has higher calories, basically no protein, lots of sodium, and does the ‚Äú5 servings per container‚Äù trick; yet has a 50/100 score. Meaning, according to Yuka, it‚Äôs better to eat the bad thing."
3,curiouscurls,"I downloaded this app, but didn‚Äôt realize you had to pay to type products in for a product search. If you have the bar code, great! (If Yuma recognizes it) but if there isn‚Äôt a barcode‚Ä¶your out of luck. Unless, of course, you want to pay for a membership."
2,RteSixtySix,Would have given a 5 star review until this experience.  Scanned all my lotions and they got horrible numbers based on bad ingredients.  Threw them all out and purchased the recommended 100/100 brand only to tell my daughter to purchase the exact same and when she scanned it got a 0/100.  What is going on???
5,nlococo,I switched phones from an Android to an Apple. I had the Yuka App on my Android. I downloaded it on my iPhone. When I opened it and clicked sign it with email I put my email and it asks for my first name. I put it. And then it asks for a password. I don‚Äôt remember my password so I put a new one. It doesn‚Äôt give me a forgot your password space.  Then it just says ‚Äúoops the email seems invalid‚Äù Please help.  Nancy
5,B. EM,Amazing app! It definitely helps me with my purchases. Easy to use and great info: it lists of the good and bad ingredients from food and cosmetic products by scanning the bar code.
5,TommyShaw,"I‚Äôve had this app for about a year and I love it. It‚Äôs very quick and responsive, I just became a premium member, (not necessary but very inexpensive) so that I can scan in stores where there in no internet. It‚Äôs unbelievable the amount of crap these food companies are putting in our food. This app rates each food item from 0-100 and tells you all the ingredients and additives. For example Ritz crackers are a 0-out of 100(very bad) with terrible ingredients and additives, I never knew this until I scanned the code on the box. You‚Äôll be shocked at what these food companies are getting away with, and we are feeding this crap to our kids, it‚Äôs crazy. Great job to the developers!"
1,Ca$hia,"I just downloaded this yesterday. I‚Äôm deleting it today. I opted for the free version just to try it out. I scanned my first 2 products. Result: a Red Dot , the numbers 15/100, and the word ‚ÄúBad.‚Äù  Yeah, that‚Äôs it, unless you want to shell out over $100 for a yearly subscription, that‚Äôs it. When I tried to get a recommendation for an alternative (‚ÄúGood‚Äù) product, the app opened a page for me to type a category (you must guess; there‚Äôs no list to pick from). I tried to type in several different categories (‚Äúskin;‚Äù ‚Äúmassage cream,‚Äù ‚Äúhand cream,‚Äù), but no response. This app appears to be for kindergarteners. Very disappointed."
5,hsnsbnss,"I never write reviews for apps, but this app is truly life changing. I‚Äôve never loved an app more then this. I never buy anything without scanning it now, and I‚Äôve nearly thrown away so many products and foods of mine that were praised by everyone. Let me tell you never buy anything(even if everyone is saying it‚Äôs amazing) with out using this app on it first. Like I‚Äôm telling you thousand of products I used for skin care were known as amazing, then when I scanned them it was literally full of trash that should be nowhere near your face. My skin cleared up so fast after using this app of everything. Save your money and buy this app, IM BEGGING."
4,Young for life,I absolutely loved this app! Until‚Ä¶I went to scan a hair product. When I scanned the label on the product it said it was bad. But then I scanned the bar code on the price sticker and it said good. Starting to question the quality of accuracy.
1,fhxhbshsnxhx,they said my rx bars were a 35/100 whereas a cliff at is a 52/100 i gag bc of how sweet cliff bars are there is no weird ingredients or added sugar. thank u and f yuka
2,bellacece1,"What kind of an app is this that does not include ALL nutritional info including carbohydrates?After scanning a food item,  that‚Äôs the first thing most people look at.Wait, don‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶if I unlock the premium subscription and pay more I can get carbohydrate information."
5,Doc Kirtikar,"I have had this app for less than 24 hours, and have scanned everything in my entire house, plus what I ate at work today.   In America, I understand we have the loosest laws when it comes to what we ingest and put on our body. I‚Äôm somebody who has auto-immune diseases and skin hyper-reactivity. For years I‚Äôve been trying to switch soaps, lotions, body washes etc. trying to figure out what is causing break outs. Dermatologists have even recommended lotions that score 10/100 on this app, and the extra information provided on why is just icing on the cake.   I‚Äôve told all my friends about this app already. Honestly, I think it will help solve all of the issues I‚Äôm currently dealing with, and lead to a cleaner/healthier lifestyle. The information provided from this app is essential information that should all be known to the public when buying certain products. I‚Äôm glad there is finally a way for people to easily get the information and understand. I‚Äôm moving to Japan for the next 3 years, for work, and wonder if this app will work over there."
5,Jazzy Razzle,"Foods nowadays are very hazardous with artificial chemicals and colorings and all that good stuff that causes diabetes and high blood pressure ,cancer. Simply ridiculous that the FDA let‚Äôs this happen.You have to fend for yourself and research what you‚Äôre eating because the man doesn‚Äôt care about you.Just selfish profits.It really seems like they‚Äôre trying to poison us. This app is excellent and protecting you."
5,Mother Daughter Cycling,Best app on the market.  Many thanks to the team that designed and developed this app.  The world applauses you.  9 years of researching ingredients just made easier just buy scanning a bar code.  Thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Ngmkc,"This app is CRAP! I scanned some things to see how accurate this app is and it gives things 5/100 for one wrong thing when there‚Äôs about 20 greens. Another one was a protein shake that had 50/100, everything was good and perfect but it didn‚Äôt have 100/100 because of the calories which was only 170. Don‚Äôt bother."
3,tynriggs,"App is good but not going far enogh for 18.50 a year. Does not inform of Bio Engineering Foods, GMO Foods and Mono and Poly Saturated Fats.  If you‚Äôre going to do this do it right ?"
4,alllysoon,"i love this app, i use it for everything, but‚Ä¶ i wish there were a feature to filter what you do and don‚Äôt want to see. i have this app to check specifically for carcinogens. it‚Äôs super annoying  to see a food item get a 30/100 for dangerous  cancer-causing chemicals, and then immediately after see another food get a 30/100 for ‚Äútoo much sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúlots of calories‚Äù. i wasn‚Äôt buying chocolate chips because i think they‚Äôre low calorie. i don‚Äôt care. i just wish there were a way to filter out specifically what chemicals, allergens, etc. you want the rating to be based on.   second point on the same note: it can be really triggering for people recovering or recovered from eating disorders to see the calories, sugar content, etc. i really feel it should be an option to see what you care about and filter out the things you don‚Äôt."
5,Allie3513,It‚Äôs the best app for you
1,N8T0,This app contradicts many products already rated by EWG.org which uses science and peer reviewed studies to determine safety. And EWG is free to use.
5,Gvjitezcbklkvfs,lesgooo ozarka is 100/100 :D
5,Kathy valley,"I just graduated to the paid version, and I‚Äôve been using it constantly! There were lots of items that don‚Äôt have a bar code so there are so many more things to check. I‚Äôve made quite a few healthier choices as I‚Äôm shopping."
3,Mmmhhyus,"I think this is a good app for looking at harmful ingredients but it was rating products I knew were healthy (natural almond butter, tahini, cacao nibs) as bad because they were ‚Äútoo caloric and fatty‚Äù. It would also rate more processed things as good, such as my granola (with a score of 82/100). It just felt a little inconsistent :( No app is perfect, but take the information this app provides with a grain of salt."
5,yaggaaaaa2021,I love this app ! I take it grocery shopping with me and scan whatever I want and try to only get 80/100 and higher!
1,Luvlyfemale,This app gives things with fragrance a high score. Things with fragrance is the way company‚Äôs hide bad ingredients so I don‚Äôt understand how they got a good rating. For example they rated atoderm shower oil as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù with 79/100 and it has fragrance in it but in the THINK DIRTY app they rated the same product an 8 which is a red zone for it being bad. I‚Äôd download the think dirty app instead of this one. It‚Äôs not accurate at all.
1,Meaganwolfe,"I have some serious issues with this app regarding food. First of all, I‚Äôve had items at a mere 100-200 calories being flagged as ‚Äútoo caloric.‚Äù The average person needs 2,000 calories today, 100 calories is nowhere near too caloric and is highly triggering to those with disorders.   Secondly, I have peanut butter being flagged as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù for being high in saturated fat. 4 grams of saturated fat is not high, especially in comparison to items like ice cream that are truly high in saturated fat. Additionally, what matters is your overall daily consumption in total. I eat well below the daily limits and I track everything in myfitnesspal.   My biggest complaint of all is that it rates foods labeled ‚Äúnatural‚Äù as better for not true reason. Look up skippy peanut butter. The regular one gets flagged as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù for too caloric and saturated fat. Nothing else. The natural skippy is labeled as ‚Äúgood‚Äù even though it‚Äôs still flagged for those two items plus another- high sodium.   A food is not too fatty just because it is comprised mostly of fat! You need a combination of all these macros every day, it‚Äôs how you use them! Pair the ‚Äútoo fatty‚Äù peanut butter with bread and banana and you have a balanced snack.   This app should be focused on pointing out problematic ingredients like hidden preservatives, and TRULY high ranges of calories, sugars, and saturated fats."
1,britsran,"I was excited to try out this app to see how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù the foods were that are in my home. I don‚Äôt believe this app is reliable whatsoever. I scanned my organic coconut crispy rollers that are non gmo with no added sugar, colors, preservatives, etc and got a 30/100 ‚Äúpoor‚Äù which I thought was strange but what did it for me that the suggested alternative was Hershey Cookie and cream dipped pretzels were 60/100 ‚Äúgood‚Äù!!!!! Absolutely deleting an app that promotes artificial flavors and sugars over organic all natural products. It doesn‚Äôt take into account that the sugar/ fats are naturally occurring from the coconut. Be careful using this app. Their healthy doesn‚Äôt actually mean healthy... Search for items with no seed oils, no artificial colors/ flavors and with ingredients you can pronounce. You‚Äôd be better off using these suggestions than using this app. I‚Äôm curious if this app is paid by companies to promote their products‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
1,Jamejame211,"I work closely with my dietitian to find clean foods. Just because the nutrition label on products look nice, 8% sugar or 80 calories, does not mean the quality of that product is good. You HAVE to look at the ingredients. Enriched wheat flour, vegetable oils, canola oils, dextrose, corn starch and many more are highly processed & highly inflammatory ingredients. I tested out this app to scan my favorite brand Simple Mills which has been approved by my dietitian & many others to be a very clean brand. They only use real, organic & natural ingredients that you can actually pronounce and know of and most of their products contain very few ingredients. For example instead of Enriched wheat flour they use almond flour or seed & nut flour, instead of vegetable or canola oil they use coconut oil and peanut oil. Just a side note but vegetables do not naturally secrete oils but coconuts do and peanuts do. Anyways when I scanned my crackers from simple mills this app rated it at 27/100 poor. So I do not 100% trust this app. I‚Äôve also scanned some other products from other clean brands and it was a hit or miss on the rankings. I think this app should also take into consideration the ingredients in products whether it‚Äôs highly processed, highly inflammatory‚Ä¶. So far I believe they focus more on the nutrition labels and they use that to rank products. But like I said just because the nutrition labels look nice does not mean the quality is nice too."
5,Awill528,"Do yourself a favor and download this app and become a premium member. It‚Äôs not that much money. You will make better choices at the store, whether you are buying food, skincare, or makeup (possibly more?) so don‚Äôt be shy üòå"
2,baileyseirup,"Doesn‚Äôt recognize things like high fructose corn syrup or propylene glycol (anti freeze) and says those products are still 93/100 when they absolutely should NOT be rated so highly since, you know, it‚Äôs poison."
1,Do Not get or subscribe!!!!,"I want to rate this a zero but I cannot. So I give you a 1!!! Do not believe everything you read/see/etc. Do your own research and employ multiple peer reviewed sources. Also understand the difference between something like high fructose corn syrup and sugar. Do your homework and research but don‚Äôt believe influencers, blogs,vlogs, etc. without proper verification. This app is not helpful and only is geared towards making you want to buy their subscription.  Update Feb 1 2022:  The developers want people to think they have accurate information in this app. If you research the information they provide to ‚Äúprove‚Äù their info. You will find some have nothing to do with what they are rating as ‚Äúbad‚Äù. They say something is ‚Äúgood‚Äù but does not apply to everyone in all situations. They say ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù are ‚Äúbad‚Äù but everything has them and our bodies make them as well. Organic foods use pesticides. Nitrates are found in soil and are taken up into plants. This app makes claims that their ‚Äúbetter‚Äù suggestions are better but again they are not and misleading.   DO NOT USE THIS APP OR PAY FOR THEIR SERVICE. It would be better if you consult a nutritionist that is credible and can give multiple peer reviewed case information."
1,mjceron,"This is the worst app to use if you are trying to eat cleaner/healthier. It goes off caloric history not ingredients, which is terrible! It rated my three ingredient ‚Äúlesser evil popcorn‚Äù a 46/100 which is FASLE because it is one of the healthiest popcorns out there. Don‚Äôt waste your time like I did mine.  Update: after the terrible response I got back for the app. They still do not understand what they see doing wrong. When you have a bag of chips from the Siete brand deemed ‚Äúpoor‚Äù that‚Äôs how you should know this app needs help. Again everyone, read your ingredients no need for an app to tell you what you shouldn‚Äôt/should eat. Needs way more help."
5,trustdanuts,This app is so amazing I shared it with almost everyone in my contacts. This app has helped me choose the right products and helped save money!!! I just got done throwing away all the things that are bad for my health . THANK YOU SO MUCH YUCA /YUKA for creating this app and showing the ingredients that should not be consumed!! This app is GOLD!! üí™ü•≥
5,Random nickname: ggnhgg,I live by this app.My whole family downloaded it as well. We all enjoy it.  Thank you so much for creating it. please keep it free
5,Daizy flower,"I love this app! I happened upon this app after searching for a new fun game app. But after searching for a hour or so I somehow came across this one. I have and have had different app‚Äôs similar to this but this one seems way more efficient and easier to use. The way it breaks a product down and instantly give you the information after scanning the bar code will help me make BETTER choices before the going to the grocery store and even while at the store!  I‚Äôve already shared this app with the family.  Thanks Yuka, Yu..kas got my voteüòäüôåüèΩ‚úåüèΩüôèüèΩ"
5,Cecile011,"Yuka is the app the world desperately needed to shed some light onto the complex list of ingredients in the foods we eat and the cosmetics we use. It allows you to quickly scan bar codes to find products (so far it correctly identified 98% of what I scanned).   For each product, it lists all additives or preservatives, explains what they are for and assigns a risk rating to each of them. It also highlights which foods have too many calories or a high ratio of saturated fats. With all that info, it assigns an overall health rating to the products, from bad to excellent.   It‚Äôs not always what you think. I was surprised to find out that frozen burritos I guiltily indulge in are good. While my hippie health granola had a poor rating (no harmful additives but too much saturated fat). I have since cut out a few items from my grocery list. I also love that Yuka gives you recommendations (often spot on) to replace items.  Yuka also works with Cosmetics. I had cleansing products and shampoos that I thought were clean that I won‚Äôt be buying again. Yuka helped me find a new shampoo I love with no toxic ingredients.  The app is well-designed and is snappy. When you place your screen over the bar code, it finds it almost instantly.  I downloaded two similar apps the day I downloaded Yuka and Yuka was the only one I kept. One was slow to scan items, taking 20-30 seconds to load results. The other app was as fast as Yuka but didn‚Äôt assign ratings to the products.  I love Yuka! It is a game-changer. Thank you!"
1,yukastinks,"It doesn‚Äôt take into account proportion sizes and just seems inaccurate. For example it gave body armor a well know sports drink that is widely considered a healthy substitute for Gatorade a 4/100 which is terrible. Then I compared it to Diet Coke which is widely regarded as one of the most unhealthy drinks around, it got a score of 41/100 which isn‚Äôt necessarily good but is certainly better than 4. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense"
1,samantha3669,"So I thought this app was great at first, until I was showing it to a friend and demonstrated how to use it by scanning one of my favorite snacks. When I scanned it for her, it came up as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù with a 30/100, which was very confusing as I had scanned the same package before, just with a different nut as a flavoring, and it had scored 79/100. So I went to compare what it said about the snacks, and it had the same exact ingredients, same amount of ingredients, in the same order. But on one package it said that 7g of sugar was a bit too sweet, 180cal were low and 4g of fat was low impact, where as on the other package it said 7g of proteins was good, 180cal were too high and 4g of fat was too fatty. How does this make any sense?"
