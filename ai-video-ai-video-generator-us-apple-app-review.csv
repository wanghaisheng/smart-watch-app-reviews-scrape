4,Mialia7,"I really like using the app but fine that I have to do it over and over again to get it right. On one try the two pictures never came together. It looked really weird. Also for some reason every time I do one with myself and my boyfriend, he always ends up with earrings in his ear, which he doesn‚Äôt wear, it‚Äôs odd. The last suggestion I would say is figuring out a way to add height relativity into it. I‚Äôm 5 foot six. My boyfriend is 6 foot tall but in each of the videos, I‚Äôm either above him or equal to him which realistic."
1,Bubba27373939,"First of you can‚Äôt image to video and do any of the squeeze or make it cake or anything like they even though it offers a section for each ..where you upload an image in the box you tap it nothing happens .. it won‚Äôt let you upload an image at all in any part of this app lol .. so all those cool effects they probable got you here do not work in app .. second anything you Text to Vid every thing you enter renders into a 5 second all black video with no sound or image .. lol take thet back it does render the Inside of a black hole really well over and over .. your better off walking up to a wall with a dragon and asking it to draw a photo on itself than to get video out of this app.. its honestly hilarious if this is the app model .. show cool effects you can do ..lure in unsuspecting buyers , make the app a rock with words on it then they crushed it .. if you purchase this app  and think your about to turn your gf into a cake and cut it with a knife and get some sweet loving for your amazing tech skill it‚Äôs not gonna happen .. üëäüòâ fawk this app lol"
1,Midnight Rider2013,"Listen to the people who leave a one or two star review. We are being honest to a fault. Even when you look at 3-5 star review, they seemed to have a flawed review where they aren‚Äôt completely satisfied. There is truth that when you sign up, this app makes you pay for everything. You can‚Äôt see anything free to see if you actually like the app. By looking at the pictures and what this app does offer, there are other apps that has better quality, and they allow you to have a free trial, and a few things free to see if you like the app. Avoid paying for this app. It‚Äôs a gimmick trying to mimic other apps out there that actually are better. Not only review other apps but test drive other apps. This app doesn‚Äôt even let you test drive. In my professional opinion, if they don‚Äôt let you test drive, avoid at all costs. Take your money somewhere else. You will thank me later."
1,Steph Lynne,"This AI is very low level in its ability. The advertising indicates you can create all kinds of magic from still photos. Example‚Ä¶ When choosing certain options, it will do something entirely different, like if I try and make an image crush, it will do something else. You also only have a certain amount of images you can use each day, so if you have 7 unsuccessful attempts with things not happening properly, and you have to delete those attempts, you have almost lost your daily quota. I can only hope this AI app improves over time. At this point Im very disappointed and think its a waste of money. I purchased a 1 year subscription, so each day I will use it, and hopefully this AI will develop its skills and get better."
5,BC93001,I like the App it‚Äôs really cool but it be cool to have more features on there having pictures come to life and make it do things is interesting to me but I wish there a was something we can about the limits you can only use the app so often and it doesn‚Äôt even ask for payment to refill or doesn‚Äôt say when it‚Äôs going to get restored so you can use it again but it‚Äôs just my opinion and thought on it
1,Com to the er,"This ridiculous app charges to create anything at all so you can‚Äôt see what it‚Äôs going to be like until you pay. Every single video is 3 seconds long. There‚Äôs no option for longer, and they‚Äôre horrible. Distorted and weird looking. It‚Äôs actually worthless. Like literally there is nothing of value from this app and they charge $40!!!!!!!! I‚Äôm trying to get a refund through the App Store, but I‚Äôm assuming these scammers are going to end up keeping my money. Any and all somewhat positive reviews are fake and made up. There is zero chance that any real person would EVER say a single positive thing about this app. It‚Äôs horrific. The worst app in the history of apps. No exaggeration."
1,Zsoltinla,"Sure, here‚Äôs a review based on your input:  ---  I recently tried out and paid one week of subscription for this AI video generation tool, and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. The graphics produced by this tool are subpar, falling far short of what one would expect from a modern image generator like DALL-E. The frame rate is abysmally low, hovering around 5 frames per second, which makes the video choppy and unpleasant to watch.  Moreover, the size of the generated picture is quite small, which severely limits its usability. This tool doesn't come anywhere close to providing the high-quality visuals necessary for professional animation or even decent amateur projects. Given its current state, it feels more like an experimental product rather than a practical application.   In its present form, I can't justify spending money on it. This should be offered as a free service until it can deliver a more polished and useful output. For now, I would not recommend this tool to anyone serious about video creation or animation."
3,Pissy bot,As many comments have suggested the AI creates weird blurs where they shouldn‚Äôt be.  Like a hand will look like it‚Äôs blowing away or turning into smoke.  I understand that this may be the limits of the ai right now but it means you have to generate multiple times to get something looking semi normal.  Which is ok IF they didn‚Äôt limit you to a number of renderings a day.  Come on!  I‚Äôm paying for this and don‚Äôt get a usable product based on the developers restrictions.  There are a million ai graphics programs on the market now maybe worth looking at a different one.
5,Leopard Designs,"Thank you, Apple once again for providing a really great app that allows me to do a few things that I wasn‚Äôt able to do with Canada or some of the other video editing programs where I wanted to simply overlay a transparent flame on top of picture. Then I discovered this app and simply told it what I wanted to do and it gave me a really, really really awesome response now I‚Äôll play with it more. Thank you again."
2,egghhhhhhhgg,"takes 5 mins MINIMUM for each video to load, only 1 video can be made at a time. only was able to make 4 videos (one was an accident as you cannot cancel an upload) before the app started bugging and didnt let me make any more worst $5 ive ever spent and that says a lot given my purchase history. i would ask for a refund but the creators of this game clearly need the $ to get better developers  i really do like the idea and it has potential , just horribly executed. definitely not something anyone should pay for in its current state."
5,little old man boy,"Each time I upload an image and try to use any Image to Video feature like Inflate It, the app will not create when I press the create button, the button goes away into thinking mode for a second but then it reappears and pressing it again doesn‚Äôt make the video create, the button just keeps appearing and reappearing. I love the app so please work to fix this."
5,DDRL Podcast,"I have been obsessed with Ai since day 1 years ago & embrace this technology in every avenue possible.  I mentor everyone I come across about the fantastics of Ai especially on my podcast. This app definitely is very unique and fun ! Few things could be tweaked if you‚Äôd like my recommendations but beyond those minors, it‚Äôs a very cool platform to implement into your reels & posts"
1,disappointed5785867587,"Tried the hug affect and image to video affect about 12 times. 9 out of 12 times you sit and wait for 5 minutes plus for the video to generate only for it to quit the process altogether and give you a ‚Äúsomething went wrong try again later‚Äù warning. And the few times it did ‚Äúwork‚Äù two of them the pictures didn‚Äôt even move. There was just a slight zoom in effect. The one time out of all of the attempts where the people in the images moved, one person stood still completely and the other barely turned. They didn‚Äôt even touch each other let alone hug. This is trash."
3,Zack Sheats,"For how much you pay, I really don‚Äôt want a limit after a few generations. I try to use this app as a quicker way to generate AI rooms for interior decor clients in while at their homes, and after paying for the service, you don‚Äôt get more than a few videos out of it. The AI itself is okay, it is quite buggy actually. You have to be pretty detailed to get a worthy result.   For what it is, it‚Äôs alright. Would I renew my subscription again? Probably not! There‚Äôs plenty of other better AI generators out there!"
2,jayy5565,I‚Äôm a huge fan of Michael Jackson and I always listened to his music every day and today when I downloaded this app I immediately went to the hugging feature and I took a picture of myself and I took a picture of Michael Jackson and I was so excited to see me and Michael Jackson huge me but when I hit create it said I needed to pay for it because of that stupid premium! And I asked my mom if I could buy it but she said no. This ruined my entire day. Pls remove the premium I wanted to see my favorite celebrity hug me but it looks like that isn‚Äôt happeningüòû
1,PrincessTja,"I wish I could get my $5 back! I downloaded this app because they advertised the ability to create videos of two pictures hugging. I thought this would be perfect since I recently lost my grandmother and would love to see her hugging me one more time. Unfortunately, I kept getting an error message everytime no matter what pictures I used. Then I tried the ‚Äúbring pictures to life ‚Äú tool. Don‚Äôt do anything. Just stretched the picture to make it look like it was moving. Just disappointed. Save your $5 and just use your imagination- it will be less frustrating."
1,KP1111112,"I paid for a app with a daily limit of use. This world keeps getting worse. Haha a daily limit what a joke. It works until the daily limit and half of what you get is just a blank screen washing you very few attempts at making something with this a.i. hopefully it gets better I wish someone would tell me the name of a really good one. I need something much better than this one. But I made some cool stuff before the daily limit. Now I know about the limit I don‚Äôt know how many tries we get a day? I say tries because for me, most attempts did not work‚Ä¶"
2,bradpell,"I haven‚Äôt had a lot of time to play with the app but, what I have tried so, far is the text to video and text to dance video. Uhm‚Ä¶wow‚Ä¶how far from my description was the result. One prompt I wrote translated in a glitchy set vibrating strings, which was not even close to the crazy scene I described using human characters.  The system doesn‚Äôt kick the prompt as easily as some (due to mild but, apparently ‚Äúinappropriate content ‚Äú) it doesn‚Äôt produce what you describe. Hopefully, they‚Äôll work night and day to really produce the app they advertise."
3,Red B*tch,"It‚Äôs really kind of amazing how you can bring two still photos to life and together. Only downside is that it does alter the faces. Sometimes it‚Äôs slight but it is noticeable but then the next one it can look like completely different people by the end. I was hoping to bring to life photos of me and my late father but it was a bit underwhelming due to us having completely different faces after AI did its thing. I don‚Äôt know because honestly, I‚Äôm kind of on the fence."
1,mrwarrenpeace,"I bought this app for a project I‚Äôm working on and immediately cancelled my subscription‚Ä¶ like within 5 minutes! It‚Äôs just not ready as far as other ai platforms. The more detailed you are, the bigger the failure at rendering the video. It was giving me videos that were completely useless. Simple prompts: Man in a hoodie standing over a London backdrop, zoom out, high quality. Images walking 2 legs turn into 3! Cities from aerial view bend as it pans‚Ä¶ just not ready and not worth the price tag! Kinda feel sorry for those who bought the year subscription!"
4,bluesnurse,I need the ai to work more like chat gpt when it comes to video generation and do exactly what I say along with generating voices or even allowing me to do some voice overs. What I need is this ai to search the web for the exact things I want. Also being able to go into my photos so I can have specific things I can add to the video
1,HevnzHere,"Maybe I expected too much with the previews that I saw as advertisement. Not only do the videos take a while to upload, There‚Äôs only a small handful of options and they really don‚Äôt do anything that‚Äôs appealing and worth the money. I‚Äôve spent.  The ones that let you insert the image barely show my image before the effect takes place, which is totally pointless if I‚Äôm doing it for advertising purposes. Truly disappointed. This is why I normally don‚Äôt buy things without a trial first, but I was not offered a trial so I thought I‚Äôd go for it. That‚Äôs my fault."
5,Keywiz,"I‚Äôve been really enjoying this app. Totally works and I don‚Äôt know what any of those negative reviews are referring to. I‚Äôve used this app to make so many of my friends smile. There are a lot of apps on the iOS store that claim to do different AI procedures, but many don‚Äôt work. This one absolutely does and I‚Äôm a happy customer. There is magic here."
1,Dottie Boss,I managed to make a good hugging video of a friend and a loved one who has passed on. I tried to create one of my mother and my child and the AI kept messing up. First it had a technical error and told me to try again later. And when it finally started working it kept messing up my mom and child‚Äôs faces. I continued trying to find some pictures that would make a nice hug video and then the app said I‚Äôd ‚Äúreached my daily limit‚Äù it didn‚Äôt tell me I even had a daily limit. For $5/week the creators of this app have some serious NERVE! DON‚ÄôT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Waste of time and money!
5,TheMoringaKing12,"The hugging functionality is excellent some times - it‚Äôs sort of a hit or miss, but they should offer more functions with the real pictures as opposed to just the ai ones. Like maybe dancing or kissing and stuff like this with the photo drop function. I can say it‚Äôs worth using. It‚Äôs very fun."
1,Cone12flat,"I paid for a yearlong subscription for this app based on several advertised features and editing options, it‚Äôs less then 24 hours and the developers have put out an update that took away all those features, the very reason I signed up for the app.     Total bait and switch- the remaining AI features are a joke, they describe them as ‚Äúvideos‚Äù but clips would be more accurate as they barley generate 5 second long images- and the fun options ‚Äúcake-ify‚Äù ‚Äúmelt‚Äù  and more have all been removed-"
1,Miss my pup toby,"It doesn‚Äôt work & it tricks you & it‚Äôs really sad. I saw an add for this app on snapchat & it told me I could see a video of my DECEASED pet & I hugging through AI. My heart broke. Of course I downloaded the app & it said if I paid $5 for it I could see what I had only dreamed of before. Come to find after paying the money that after uploading the pictures it just says ‚ÄúVideo in progress‚Ä¶ Videos ready in 3 minutes‚Äù on an endless loop. A scam & a rip off, & one that uses your emotions to pull you in too. Really sad. Was really upset after this one."
3,grazie82736,"Dont waste your money. First one worked. Then ALL stop working- I did all kind of images to help with the model - zoom into the face, good quality. Nothing... money wasted, also kind of stressful because I did for make pictures turn little live of love ones who passed away and memories. I mean simply doesn't work, the pictures never change. Its a huge bug."
2,Mozeik,"You cannot upload photos and manipulate them with text prompts as it is advertised. It is HEAVILY advertised that there are those specific features. I wrote to their team and they gave a vague response that they told their team about it and they are working on it. I paid for the 1 year subscription and feel scammed. If they do update the app and make those changes, I will change my rating."
5,Deenag45067,I was skeptical of this app at first - they say if it‚Äôs too good to be true it usually is. But my broken heart wanted another hug from my daughter who tragically passed away. It‚Äôs way more than I expected. I can‚Äôt stop watching the hugging video and have smiled through my tears. Thank you!!!
1,EsctacyArtistry,"Normally I don‚Äôt bother with AI apps but thought I‚Äôd try it for the ‚ÄòHugging Video‚Äô as my mother passed away in 2016 and I have no photos or videos of us. Had to pay $5 just to see if it would even work. After paying the one video it did make was absolutely terrible. I used higher quality photos to try and see if that would help, but no! Its been processing since and won‚Äôt allow me to use any other app features‚Ä¶ My video has been ‚Äúready in 1 minute‚Äù for several now."
1,Honeybeeforeman,"Your child will ask to download this and then you will say yes to ‚ÄúGet‚Äù then you will download it and then your the kid will pay full price and you get to eat the cost. This is how business is done nowadays. It‚Äôs a shameful practice, but it is allowed by Apple.   Buyer beware! do not press get unless you want to pay full price which your child will gladly do after you‚Äôve downloaded the app. So much for an app creator and Apple having integrity and doing the right thing."
1,DonimorethanoneDonut,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews for apps, but this one particularly bugged me. To charge as much as they do for essentially the most worthless app takes a lot of audacity. Constantly crashes. Videos come up as errors or don‚Äôt even get made at all a lot of time. And even when the videos get made, it‚Äôs actually awful. You sit waiting for a few minutes only for some awkward distorted mess. Do not waste your time downloading this app and definitely do not pay a penny!"
1,Free Coins!!!St,"The video quality is not what is depicted in the App Store or in ads.  Not even closed.  The videos are grainy and pixelated and, even worse, appear to run at 15 frames per second, causing choppy, terrible-looking videos.  The quality of the advertised videos and those produced in the app are so far off it feels borderline fraudulent.  To be clear, I‚Äôm not complaining that the videos aren‚Äôt pristine, 4K videos, I‚Äôm complaining because they look like Tumblr gifs from 2005."
4,The Wood66,It‚Äôs okay great way to improve pictures but it has its limits on the videos you can make 5-6 videos per day when you pay 39 dollars a year you be able to make as many as you want and putting pictures on the video can and should be easier
1,ModMerchant,"On the add it looked like something that I would like. WRONG!! I tried it and FIRST I wasn‚Äôt able to do anything without paying $5 A WEEK! Then finally I paid and the things didn‚Äôt look real AT ALL!! I tried to make me and my gf kiss, and we went through each other‚Äôs noses and lips! And the back of my head looked like a monkey was hanging off. And my gf was doing a weird grinch smile. I tried to undo my subscription but it wouldn‚Äôt let me! It‚Äôs a scam!!!  So the only thing that I would suggest is DONT SELL THIS APP ANYMORE!!!!! From:ModMerchant."
1,elfin_kate,"I downloaded the app just to try out a few specific features like ‚ÄòSquished‚Äô and ‚ÄòCake-ified.‚Äô I paid for a week, experimented with the videos, canceled the subscription, and planned to make one more video while my week was still active. To my surprise, after a couple of days, those features were no longer available, even though my subscription was still active. Very disappointing that none of the fun features were accessible anymore."
1,Bribarnhart,"Quality of of videos is very poor and the length is 3 secs max.  Actually looks like a live picture on loop.  do not buy this app. There is no trial and you will be forced to pay for at least one week. I‚Äôve used it for about 10 minutes and I‚Äôm going to be requesting my money back from Apple because this is not a video generator app.    If you‚Äôre serious about trying to create quality content, stay away from this app because you‚Äôre not gonna get it here."
1,1111111112222w222222w222,"I want to take a picture of my mom and take a picture of me and make us hugging, but this stupid app charges everything. I tried all of them they you have to have to pay money before you could see your video. This is so stupid of enough they should make at least one of them, which is the one that you could hug other people if you put two pictures at least make that one free, so my review on this is zero stars but there‚Äôs no zero stars so one star"
1,Ehsan Barton,"I‚Äôve never written a review, but couldn‚Äôt go by in case of this app. It is terrible. If I could, I would return my money, because I canceled my subscription after 15 min of using it. You can‚Äôt influence anyhow at the outcome (movement, camera, ratio, etc) anyhow.  The video you get is nothing alike you see in advertisements. It doesn't even have any movement there in most tries.  It is like baby AI, who hasn't been taught anything about video creation. Don't make my mistake, don't download this app."
4,Der K√∂bler,"Daily limits are understandable to not overwork the servers, but it shouldn‚Äôt be so low. The quality of the renders have fallen drastically as well, with random people often appearing in hugging videos. Someone‚Äôs definitely doing this better on another app."
2,Ukitect,"I downloaded the app and intended to do a test to see if the subscription was worth it. However, the only tests available were off ‚Äòprompts‚Äô ‚Äî no way to use my own material. How do I know each prompt is not some canned video? And even if the prompts generate new material each time, how do I know the tool can‚Äôt do custom videos? This app should allow one free AI generated custom video before committing to purchase a subscription."
1,J1122334455,I have to update after several days and yes I mean days of use. This app is terrible. It works maybe 5% of the time.  It offers only a few options. The video prompts are really just ok. And the AI it develops is pretty fair at best. You can easily tell where it‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal‚Äù. The worst part of all is that they ask you to pay and then limit the usage. It says .77 cent per week for unlimited use and unbenounced to you that only means 1-2 animations created a day. Not worth the cost. NOT WORTH IT!!
5,Gdjdd cc hdhjcsgjcko,"Well, the reason why I give this a good rating is because you can see yourself doing something that you wanna see you doing that you‚Äôve never been able to do before so that‚Äôs why I think it deserves five stars"
3,Miztrizzzzz,"I‚Äôve subscribed and paid money just for there to be a daily limit. I‚Äôm trying to create the perfect video of my baby cousin and my father which both passed away, and was told I have a limit. Am I taking to much AI that there ain‚Äôt enough for anyone else? Other than that, most of the videos are alright."
1,DaveHohio,"The App Store it was free. Knowing nothing is free, I figured I‚Äôd at least be able to try it. I had to subscribe for a week for nearly $ 5.00 just to try it. No wonder you have to pay before even testing out the app! I spent 20 minutes working with it and between the horrible graphics and it doing nothing even close to what I typed in, i quickly deleted it. This is far worse than anything I‚Äôve tested out and I just wasted money."
1,LouArson,"You‚Äôre forced to pay for either the week, or the full year as soon as you get started. They ask you for an app review before being able to test out the app üö©. As a graphic designer, I wanted to use this app to help in creating a few elements for me to be able to use in my designs. This app is so limited, you can only create in square format, no other size. Which is a huge disadvantage. It is not worth the money. Sorry. 1 star."
3,whitelied,"The animating still feature barely moved the portrait photo I submitted. The first try moved a shoulder, the second try did a push on the entire photo that can be done in any edit program.   I also asked it to create an animated video of a capuchin monkey on a white horse riding along a canal. Twice it put the horse in the water with a gibbon monkey on his back."
1,OWE86,"I had high hopes for this app, but it‚Äôs been a major letdown. The AI video generation sounds promising, but the app crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to complete a project. Every time I try to create or it freezes or shuts down unexpectedly, it just doesn‚Äôt function smoothly. I was really excited about the potential, but with all the bugs and crashes, it‚Äôs unusable. Definitely not worth the frustration. Needs serious improvements"
1,Jaboski95,When I downloaded the app I was expecting to receive an app that made entire videos. However I only received 2 seconds. It was just a standard AI image that you could get for free on instagram with the most basic animations . And I‚Äôm talking very basic. Finally I had also thought I was paying 0.99$ per week and you can just cancel anytime like I said. However it charged me 38$ for the entire year.  Seriously Not worth it.
5,Philly Peacock,This has unlocked so many ideas.  I think it would make a great project that I would like to incorporate this into.  I am in the processing stage to see how far I can push this app.   So far it is really good.
1,HinataRHyuga,This app is horrible. No matter how detailed your prompt is it is always wrong.  You are also limited to how many words you can put into the prompt. The ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù videos are so choppy it‚Äôs just like one big blur. There are other apps out there that do AI videos and images so much better. Do not bother with this one. I don‚Äôt typically write a lot of reviews but I was so disappointed with this app. Buyer beware. $5 (plus tax) for 2 minutes of disappointment.
1,Dougs4Given,"When I first use the app, it was excellent, but then, as I kept using it, it would not create a picture then it just kept saying error, error, error, error, over and over again and would not do a thing. Then they charge you all this money and there‚Äôs only like four things you can do with it.. The graphics when I first used, it was absolutely amazing, but then it was useless. And wasted my money."
1,Leonardandmisty,"This app clearly is not ready for prime time. The developers should be embarrassed to release such a worthless. There is a reason no free trial. It is offered, begins at that point. The cat would already be out of the bag and folks with clearly see it‚Äôs not worth five bucks a week. Yes, I was curious and subscribed for the initial one week and immediately found app is so bad, then canceled the subscription after only two abysmal rendering. Apple has to do a better job of vetting these apps."
1,Akoliadich,"I‚Äôve downloaded this overhyped app. First of all: there are zero free options (or I haven‚Äôt found any). Secondly, when you pay $5 for a week (ü§Ø), there‚Äôs still nothing to do on the app, because nothing is working. I‚Äôve tried to upload multiple images, the result is the same (‚Äúoops, something went wrong, try again later‚Äù). Nothing helps. I want my money back."
5,greendsteve,Super quick and super detailed videos. Way better than the other AI video apps I‚Äôve used for content creation. Does a better job of actually following what you‚Äôre asking in the detailed instructions
3,Oso1121,"I paid for the week subscription and made multiple generated kissing photos since I‚Äôm away from my wife. After a few it said I ‚Äúreached my limit‚Äù for the amount I can do that day. If I paid for the app and the ability to make these photos, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm held to a limit."
1,clio2000,I have trust issues. I trust just few apps or companies and allow them to get some information from me . But for sure I won‚Äôt allow my family photos to be uploaded with me knowing where it‚Äôs going and what they will do with it. Get. Another app that can do the same thing but make sure it can do it on your phone not in remote servers. So you got 1 star from me.
2,Alicewildaces,I picked an older couple and myself to hug and a not pictured male came into the frame blocking me from seeing me hugging the elderly couple entirely! lol was like a jump scare! Then I did me hugging a male and a girl I didn‚Äôt choose at all came into the frame like an attack hug violently and I watched myself to appear to almost bite her on the arm as she squeezed me violently. Halloween time stuff! I needed to hold hands just to watch what new video the ai made‚Ä¶create cautiously
1,Hollertown,"I downloaded this app cuz I saw an ad that you could use an AI Squish feature to squish an object in a video. To my disappointment, there is no such feature.  I proceeded to play with the features they did have provided (hugging, kissing, dancing, with two separate images) and each time I waited five minutes to get a message saying, to try again later. Something went wrong. Waste of money. You shouldn‚Äôt be advertising with lies."
4,niknij26b,My husband died in a house fire 9yrs ago and our daughter was 14months old at the time I just used both their pictures in the hugging ai shot and it was very touching although the faces wasn‚Äôt an exact match when the video started to move but still neat to see
1,395858262627959448614262,"The app should be called ‚ÄúAI GIF‚Äù This app does NOT make videos. It makes 2-3 second GIF type media. No sound, very low amount of movement, the quality is okay but not great. I paid $4.99 for the week thinking it was just to try it out, complete waste of money. There are waaaaaaaay better AI video generators on the market, ones that ACTUALLY make videos and don‚Äôt lie directly to you. Save yourself the time and money and move on from this app."
1,sooodisappointed345,"Bought the premium because some of the options looked cool to try. (Namely dissolve it) None of them work and they remove them from the app when I try. All that was left was less interesting effects you could get for free elsewhere. Cancelled premium and AS SOON as my premium ran out, the cool options came back. They wouldn‚Äôt entertain a refund in their support options. These guys are con artists. Absolute trash. Don‚Äôt not buy."
1,D2theE,"If you are wanting to create a hugging video of you and a loved one, do not use this app. It doesn‚Äôt let you preview the feature without paying up front. Then no matter what pictures I chose it turned the faces In my images Asian and random arms come out of the side and hug each picture. The advertisement is false this app will not take two pictures and have those two people hug each other."
1,sider321,My subscription was supposed to be 77 cents a week but these losers charges me 40 something dollars. The app is also GARBAGE!! Doesn‚Äôt do what it claims do do. Multiple times where I tried to generate a video and it says ‚Äúerror ‚Äú. I tried to make 2 pictures move and the most it did was make it wiggle. I tried to make 2 pictures hug each other but they just turned into walking dolls instead. I could go on but I don‚Äôt have time
4,Bry9999suf,Good quick video generation. Just need to be able to create longer videos. I also have another app that will allow continuation after the first video is done. You might look into that.
2,pressuredCan,"2 stars only for text prompts. There was no free trial so I couldn‚Äôt use the app without paying for subscription. And I found that upload image options doesn‚Äôt work for iOS 18, the prompt to select fails within a fraction of a second.   Will update the rating if the image upload issue is resolved. :)"
5,TiborM,"Recognizes characters very well and gives the. great natural motion. Hope to see more available templates. Randomly tells me I‚Äôm out of daily credits, but then it works a bit later."
4,leader227,"So far loving it, even went premium. It has potential but the daily limit for premium users should be removed. Other than that I hope you guys keep working on it :-)"
1,iwwegofwogz,"I calls itself free, you get the app, and you can‚Äôt do anything without paying. That‚Äôs it. Apps should not be able to falsely advertise themselves as free just to farm downloads and money by wasting peoples time. There are plenty of actually decent video generators out there, and this isn‚Äôt one of them even when you pay Sorry but you deserve this rating for being a scummy company"
1,hyfreg,"There are so many other alternatives that actually provide the results this app claims. It doesn‚Äôt even offer a free trial, instead you have to waste $4.99 to find out it‚Äôs a subpar application. The advertising for this app looks amazing and made me think I could hug my dead father one last time or animate one of his photos but no matter how many I tried all the AI did was zoom in and out of his face. No animations whatsoever."
1,yuck4567,"This is in no way a video generator. It pieces together very unrealistic pictures into almost a slide show. If you are looking for something that will take your description and create a video from it, keep looking. It doesn‚Äôt do anything you are hoping for. It should be free and even if it was free, it‚Äôs a waste of space on your device. I feel completely ripped off. Worst 5 bucks I‚Äôve every spent."
2,Cook's Wife,"Trying to figure out why I have a daily limit on something , tried to crest a video two days later and still saying I‚Äôve reached my daily limit.  It stated nothing in the policy that there would be a daily limit on my subscription. Can someone respond so I‚Äôll know to cancel or not because it‚Äôs frustrating at this point"
1,Wowzerss101,"Unfortunately, I fell for this scam through Facebook. At three second replaying AI generated video which does not allow you to add prompts nor display your vision..  Serious updates are needed and fast because I just paid for a subscription for an entire year for something I can never use and probably not get a refund. This is false advertisement as the video was shown displayed sound in a clip that was over one minute long."
3,Prabs99,"I like the app but even after you pay there is a daily limit to how much you can use it.  Additionally, you can‚Äôt get the ai video right on a first try and need multiple tries to get to a video you like. If the daily limit is removed then the app deserves 4.5 star in my book."
1,12345697$,"I‚Äôve tried several times to follow the instructions with the picture, but it simply isn‚Äôt working as advertised. While it looks easy, the actual process is far more complicated. The picture doesn‚Äôt move or respond the way it‚Äôs supposed to, which makes the entire task frustrating. Despite multiple attempts, it‚Äôs still not functioning properly."
1,KhadirAhmed,"The app isn't good at all, firstly it doesn't let you use the app and show features and force u to buy pro.. when I bought pro version to test .. it generates useless video .. i generated 2 videos and both of them just have like some motion in particular place ..   In addition app doesn't have option to cancel subscription.. i would say apple should delist this app as it lacks basic features"
2,Adamant1980,"Clips are too short, very limited interpretations on a lot of AI programs, slow processing requests, don‚Äôt get what you asked for, etc. Other than that very cool idea just needs more work to be worth the money in my opinion. Unless you like spending hours making random videos and not getting quite what you asked for or expected."
3,DiYiRi_25,"The quality of the videos is really good. The videos are short, maybe I just haven‚Äôt figured out how to make them longer yet. And I‚Äôm not sure but I think there‚Äôs a daily limit of 3 videos for the paid version. I would have passed if I had known that ahead of time"
1,xPoison89,"Tried a simple prompt ‚Äú create a video showing view from up a small mountain with other small mountains in the background in front center 3 birch trees lined up a big gust of wind knocks center tree down & it sprouts branch arms & picks itself up & walks away‚Äù   It gave me a scene of 3 birch trees, and panned the camera angle for about a second, the only thing relevant to my prompt was the three trees. This was after paying for a subscription."
4,Bookworm300,"The app is inconsistent with how many videos you can make in a day. I made 14 yesterday and it said I Rand out, then I made one earlier today and said I ran out, then I made 10 and hour ago and said I ran out."
2,GoryRose,"If your paying to use the subscription there should be no daily limit‚Ä¶.also there isn‚Äôt many filters to use, I thought after buying it would show more. Definitely won‚Äôt be buying again, there‚Äôs other better ai programs that gives you way more edits and no limit"
5,Reportfriendly,"I‚Äôm unsure if you can generate anything you would like to see, and that would be cool, and would also be cool if the app would allow more detail and longer duration of videos"
5,Andrew Bueche,So impressed with the value and potential this app holds. There are unlimited videos to generate in less than 1 minute for only $0.77 per month. This company is going to revolutionize the entertainment marketplace!
5,Arkentyme,"Wish the videos could be long just by having a longer hold time. However, this is fire. Iv been waiting for something like this."
4,Ontarget42,"The app seems like it would be really great, only problem is it didn‚Äôt do exactly what we tell it to make. Simple as saying galaxies and it does something completely else. Video length needs to be longer."
3,lamont king,The app is good but once I paid for it it only allowed me to make a couple of videos. Now all the options are gone from the home page. It‚Äôs only giving me a few options that I don‚Äôt want. The ones I paid for the app for is gone.
1,PATSY0905,"I paid for the Pro version expecting better quality and features, but this app fell way short. The quality of the video edits is terrible, and I was only able to create one video before it stopped working altogether. For an app that charges for premium features, I expected much more reliability and value. Save your money and look elsewhere."
4,Azuki010,"Well, where I can begin, the app its completely good, the Ai works well but there is sometimes that it doesn‚Äôt do well, overall it‚Äôs good at least if you want to make videos with this it‚Äôs good"
4,Stephi Styles,"I purchased the app and was limited to a daily amount however, it‚Äôs a new day and I‚Äôm still limited from yesterday. Doesn‚Äôt seem right for something purchased."
1,Jennlynnmoo,"Had there been a free trial option I would have been able to quickly identify that this app does not meet my needs. Instead, you need to pay for a week to be able to generate anything. The technology is not there for trying to generate ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù content and the video format does not work for my needs. Waste of $5 for the week I had to pay for"
4,Realwealthycash,"Wow, this app packs so many capabilities. It will surely take my content creation to the next level. I just wish the videos were longer, but pretty sure they will upgrade that down the line‚Ä¶"
1,$PLIT!!!,This app keeps making my two pictures other pictures like two women or two men when I clearly have a woman and a man and they make the same sex kiss or it just turns the man into a woman or kinda a woman with a long ponytail kissing it keeps making the pictures gayit only gets it right like 5% of the time
5,Patrick RRT,Just an amazing tool for content creators and those that are stepping up their video game. Easy to use and it creates simply beautiful images. You must get this!
5,Bcdpires,It actually worked the second time around. And I couldn‚Äôt believe it!! Definitely worth giving it a try! I‚Äôm amazed!!!
1,Champ Blankson,I just wasted 5$ thinking there would be an actual video. This app needs to fix this. There is a button to where you can press play and it‚Äôs like 1 second long and none of the characters move. It‚Äôs not an actual video just a play button of a still photo for one second. Hope they can fix this.
5,7blck,I like that I think as potential and needs cleaning up when you prompted things sometimes it goes a little haywire but like great potential keep it up guys
1,Trininurse78,"So I downloaded the app the second slide was to review the app. No way around it, or back from it. I gave 5 stars, proceeded to the payment section unfortunately that was all before trying out the site. I think this site is a fake. No way to cancel and get a refund even though I tried it out for 5 mins."
2,Lamar35,"There should be no limit to how many videos Ai videos we can make when we just payed 40 bucks for the yearly subscription. The app is definitely fun to play with, but that limit thing needs to be fixed, once it is then I‚Äôll give it a 5 star. Make my 40 bucks worth it"
1,Cost money not free,"So I downloaded it to check it out, and when I tried to use any of the three AI tools, I couldn't access any of them. In order for me to use an AI tool or style it, it takes me to a payment page asking for monthly or yearly payment. It doesn't let you try anything out without paying for it, so I rate it 1 out of 5 stars."
4,that_random_girl3210,This is cool. The ad says I can use pictures of a pet but when I try to put a picture of one of my dogs it says it can‚Äôt detect a face even though I use very clear pics of their faces
5,Djoon!,"After the update, everything started working fine. I recommend downloading and subscribing"
1,BrohamTy,i've tried to get the smash feature and the explode feature etc. to work on the latest update to the iPhone it does not work I have contacted tech-support and they gave me a list of things to try that do not work when I responded back to tech-support they have not responded back to me total waste.
1,mordecool ice,No matter images I put up or try. I would wait 5 minutes or longer every time only for it to say it had an error and to try again later. I have yet been able to create any video yet on this app. This is a major problem in my opinion and definitely needs to be corrected. Wasted my money unfortunately
1,imyourchauffeur,"Even before I got to the second screen looking the F wanted me to review. How can you review something you haven‚Äôt tried. Then it said I was able to try the app but then after inputting information, it wanted a subscription and money. It seems that all of the AI apps, including this one, have a tendency to ask for money upfront, and then are a big letdown in the long run"
3,Long term app user,"My requests were very challenging, however, while AI wasn‚Äôt quite able to give a professional video, it gave me very helpful product (video) that helped me with my designs. There is room for improvement. I would recommend it anytime"
5,end the filibuster,"I just sent my daughter a video of my face being smooshed and folded up, starting from the mouth, telling her I hope she finds it therapeutic! ü§£ü§£ü§£.   I‚Äôm gonna have endless fun with this!! üòéüëçüèª"
1,xxxVincexxx,"Edit: so I ended up buying the weekly subscription and you are bottlenecked by a daily limit roughly 20 videos, most of which had horrendous quality. This app is a complete scam. Do not buy.   App doesn‚Äôt even allow you to use it a single time without immediately paying. Not spending money on something unless I know what I‚Äôm buying."
1,James_ND,"Please do not waste your money on this app. The prompts written look nothing as you have imagined in your mind, they frame rate is that of ATARI quality, the ‚Äúvideos‚Äù generated or poorly animated clips less than 5 seconds long. I feel conned by having to pay $5 I did for a week. I‚Äôm canceling after 20 minutes, so that should tell you all you need to know."
5,Noor Khizar,I really enjoy this Al video because I live away from my love and can‚Äôt hugged him in ages but thanks to this app I was able to create a video for my love on his birthday
1,TrumpMAGA202020202020,I spent an hour trying to creat videos. It basically just generated pictures. it generated weird abstract ideas of what I was telling it and almost ZERO animation. Mostly it just moved the point of view. What is the purpose of this app? Pure garbage!  It actually seems like a scam because the majority of the reviews are 1 star. How does this app have 4.4 rating?  That‚Äôs a lie as well. I want me money back asap!
5,Jopa Music,Wish the videos were a tad longer but so far I am impressive with the results! Hope to see it get better with time!
5,mrmike1884,Gives you everything you ask for. Very realistic. Sometimes I think is shows me the real thing.
1,Sensun,The images and videos are distorted and characters are changed too much. They put limits on how many images you can process. I played with ten versions of what I wanted (poor results each time) then the app would not let process any more. Two days wait and still won‚Äôt allow me to process images. I cancelled immediately.
1,Shadowst0rm,"I‚Äôve tried many ‚ÄúAI‚Äù styled apps. Many are like this one, sadly. They want plenty of money, nag you to write a review even before you‚Äôve tried the app, and or, as in this case, there is no way to TRY without paying them money. Eh. Keep looking. Plenty of other options out there, some that‚Äôs actually offer free tries, don‚Äôt nag you, and are better quality."
3,leticiaisabelofunnyvideos,"Well, I just got the app now so I don‚Äôt really have a lot to say say but I can see that it looks good,the only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the videos are to short,I want to be able to make a 1 minute video at least,and be able to edit after I finish."
5,awitchinchaosband,"Sweet app. AI is definitely something amazing, not more amazing than God almighty, however I‚Äôm impressed. I wish the videos could be longer than 2 seconds tho."
5,cabezon84,It‚Äôs a great concept it seems it will help me with my needs creating moving images for reels üî•üî•üî• . Piece of advice play with it like everything else in life !
1,momof38362,UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS APP  they will not give you all of your free trial and if you cancel it they will still charge you and apple will not give your money back the app it‚Äôs deceitful and doesn‚Äôt  work like it should find a different one with better reviews This app is terrible It takes so long for the AI image to generate and they‚Äôre charging for that absolutely not
1,Tilden2000,App requires that you subscribe for $4.99 to really try it. Then it will charge you for a year if you don‚Äôt cancel it during the first week. Most videos I created looked too weird. Videos are too short and takes about 5 minutes to create each very short clip. I‚Äôve seen better free services.
5,Cmpily,"This app so far is allowing me to create amazing visuals, although I wish they were longer videos"
1,RSA66,"I‚Äôm not sure where the great reviews are coming from.  I purchased this and it doesn‚Äôt work half the time - certainly doesn‚Äôt work as advertised.  The features I want to use, I get an error while it‚Äôs doing it most of the time. Their feedback email never respond to the feedback.  Try something else besides this app."
1,petewisconsin,"I‚Äôve made many attempts to make videos from photos and the app keeps telling me something went wrong, even before I use a photo. Looks like there are bugs in it, seems to crash way too much. I‚Äôll try and delete it and reinstall, but I also see other reviews that say the same issue. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5,David The Great!,"This AI is fairly intuitive I‚Äôve tried different platforms and they are all reasonable, but this is fast, affordable and the results are impressive."
5,AsunaLuver,My biggest gripe would be the length of the videos (2.5ish seconds it seems) are too short. Please fix this first. TYSM!
1,The Real Inigo Montoya,"I‚Äôm so tired of apps that you install and you can‚Äôt even try it once without paying for it. Even better, it wants you to review it the first time you open it before you even get to see the interface. (Let alone see you can‚Äôt do the tests it suggests without paying) Apple needs to crack down on these."
1,TheJustinProulx,"I tried for nearly an hour to get a any resemblance of a computer turning off, then I hit my daily limit‚Ä¶ you pay a subscription to get a daily limit for a AI generator that can‚Äôt generate your prompt. 1 star, simply because it does something other than take your money."
5,Lobezzy,A few pictures turned into folks I didn‚Äôt know but overall ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è100%
1,K D T24,Don‚Äôt buy this app it only works 5% of the time and the other 95% it doesn‚Äôt work by not letting you kiss the other person or change me in the picture to a whole different person like a woman so I‚Äôm a woman kissing a woman or they even had me kiss a man! This sick sense of humor is crazy I‚Äôm not a gay male! Nor do I want to be a woman kissing a woman! Fix this please
1,Chef WillyB,"Not only do you not get a free demo, but after paying for the week, I have entered two basic video prompts to test how good it is. It takes the time to process and then literally no results. It just tells you to enter the prompt again. This app is trash and a money grab by the developers. Do not even bother!"
1,FireWater03,I bought the year access to this app ‚Ä¶ as I‚Äôm getting to know the app and features I get a pop up ‚Äú you have reached your daily limit ‚Äú . I could understand stand if I was using the trail version or even the weekly version but to have FULL access to the app with the year subscription and to be limited in effect usage is DISAPPOINTING!
1,SoCal Postmate,"No where in the terms and conditions does it say anything about a limit. There‚Äôs no information on how many videos a day I can do OR what the parameters are. Pretty annoying. Was having fun , even paid for the app. Pretty. Annoying. At least explain it ."
1,God herself,Worst app you‚Äôll ever buy . Intentional fake advertising . It makes a single bad picture and makes one or 2 elements sort of move. It‚Äôs add is a trick to get you to buy it . It‚Äôs basically a scam app that they can probably weasel out of being in trouble for in court . The add is convincing tho . I bet a million people download this before the lie it is is realized .
1,kmocek1,"You are unable to try out the app without either a weekly or yearly subscription purchase.  Once purchased, they have preset videos to inset pictures.  It will pick up the clothing but faces are not correct, they are someone else.  Not once could I get it to pick up a face."
1,SniperCashCow,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing from an Instagram ad. Unfortunately, I found that the effects like squish, explode, and cake didn't perform as expected. I also didn't find the hug feature useful. I would recommend looking into reviews before making a decision to avoid disappointment."
1,Emna998,"I was using the app and loving all the effects and videos! BUT, later during the same first day of purchase, almost all the features stopped working and I can‚Äôt use most of them anymore not generate any more videos. This is very disappointing"
1,jcafaro17,"First time I used the app it starts to create a video and then gets stuck in ""almost done"" and never finishes. I understand that this can happen but there's no cancel button, quitting the app does nothing and it won't let you create another video until the first one is finished."
1,Gettynut93,"Charge $5 a week and hit my daily limit in one hour. Takes 5 minutes to create a video, you can only make one at a time. Half the videos are useless and wrong. I would keep the app if they allowed more than 10 edits a day. Total garbage and a slap to the face. This app will soon be by the wayside."
1,Elrubioo,"Tried to do a child photo of my brothers and I, and the photo came out super warped. Tried other photos that came out better, but still not nearly as good as advertised. There‚Äôs a reason they don‚Äôt even let you try it once before you spend the $6 for the week to try it out."
1,ARami7887,"Unfortunately, I found this app to be underwhelming and lacking functionality. In my opinion, there are better software options available that can perform the same tasks more effectively. I would recommend exploring alternative solutions that can provide more satisfying user experience."
4,2277Tekken,"I cannot figure out how to increase length of the video, it gives me only 4 sec, also the resolution,  I have to resize the output to 9:16  using another app and does not look too good."
3,Salad a5s,For one I‚Äôm looking for a video generator similar to GPT where it will generate a specific video I want to match a certain speech I have and I would like a trial video to test and see if it‚Äôs capable of doing what I‚Äôm looking for before I feel it‚Äôs an investment
5,jaysuave,This is exactly what I‚Äôve been waiting for.  I hope and pray that this app Will eventually allow the user to create short films and or trailers.
4,Peaceandsage,Pretty good app! Some minor glitches but it does what it says. Try it out! You‚Äôll definitely have to redo a few until you‚Äôre satisfied but I like it!
5,George St Patrick,This app is amazing. I have only don‚Äôt 3 projects on it so far. I am mind blown at the endless possibilities. Looking forward to stretching the boundaries.
5,DustinAGU,More accurate and realistic videos than your other app
5,Ruliusmaximus,Wonderful results - absolutely stunning; never could have imagined this would be possible
1,AmandaC0719,"This app is good but I feel that if I‚Äôm paying for this I should have more than a 4 daily limit. And it doesn‚Äôt reset everyday. Made 4 yesterday, hit my limit tried to make one today and it still says I reached my daily limit. I will cancel my subscription and find something better."
5,Fabian Giudici,"So far loving the app!!! I would lower the price a little bit, $2.99 should be more than enough. Thanks"
1,PR LINK,"I understand that a pay-to-use model is in place; however, the implementation of a daily limit raises some concerns. I am currently on the second day of waiting for this cooldown period to conclude. I would appreciate any clarification on the duration of this waiting period. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
5,Professional dog lover,Why can‚Äôt I make longer than 4 second videos
1,Lorie457,"Animations are not good at all. I have tried all of them on this app and it makes the people look very distorted and as far as the hugging goes‚Ä¶nice try but does not work well whatsoever. I cancelled subscription 5 minutes later. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $4.99 a week. If it truly worked like the Ads claim, then I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping this app. Sorry guys."
1,SRYi,"Immediately after installing the app (before even trying it!) this developer asks you to give them a high rating! Why? Once inside the app, the developer does Not give you a chance to try it before requiring payment. Are they serious? We just deleted it and are now using a legitimate app."
2,RoninXavier,I‚Äôm giving this app 2 stars just for the fact that they limit how many videos you can make on the paid subscription. There shouldn‚Äôt be a limit when you‚Äôre paying for it.
3,ai.badbishes,Not terrible just needs longer duration videos even just like a 10 sec clip would make this better. Will change to 5 stars once I see this change!
1,earth01,AI videos consist of at least 2 to 3 minutes of video. That‚Äôs what I was looking for very misleading. I was wasted five dollars unfortunately for a week but luckily I did not fall for their $39 for a year otherwise would be trying to charge off my credit card.
5,lee&mary,It‚Äôs funny but it was so nice that AI can make things possible in creating two pics to hug each other we all need a hug ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ spread love
3,Rocks but one bad thing,"Get rid of daily limit, I pay the stupid subscription to have full free use, for you guys to limit my daily amount. Would be 5 stars if you change that."
5,Don Henry 58,app is great but it does not allow you to upload something and it create for you
3,emily kath,I decided after the one vid I really wanted to do that I wanted to cancel the subscription. And now I can‚Äôt! Idk if it is only for a limited time and will stop but I‚Äôm getting nervous cause I can‚Äôt cancel it!
5,Pincor Venas,I think it‚Äôs a great tool for AI storyboarding. In my case I use it to show my crew how I want our film to more or less look like.
1,amitgupta73,"This isn‚Äôt ready for prime time. Doesn‚Äôt understand the text to video prompts. Even when you break it down to simple actions it can‚Äôt do it. And because of numerous reattempts, it then tells me I ran out of daily limit. So why did you charge me for a full license, then not deliver the product?"
1,Godzillailla,No free test. So you don‚Äôt know if it works or not and your just forced to pay. I didn‚Äôt pay and I don‚Äôt think anyone should unless they have a free trial or just have an option that‚Äôs free (you can water mark it if you like) but the pay and pray it works is not good. Who are the bots review giving this thing 4 stars
5,Raki Sims,This will change my life for the better like today . lol thank you
5,HOF Player,I'm giving this review before even setting eyes on this app itself. I was hooked just from the AD!!!!
1,IWasNamedJack,When prompted to upload a photo I click on it and nothing happens. The app is completely broken and none of the features work. Complete waste of money. I requested a refund from the App Store. If you‚Äôve fallen into this trap I suggest you do the same thing. It‚Äôs basically a scam!!
1,Sad_NonUser,"Won‚Äôt upload pictures. I tap where it says to, but nothing happens. There is no support evident, no FAQ, nothing that I can find. I‚Äôm open to receiving help, but can‚Äôt access any‚Ä¶ therefore it‚Äôs Useless. So far anyway. If I can‚Äôt resolve shortly I will be canceling via my credit card."
2,Amedeonyc,Most of the tools never work and when they do They are very limited in choice so once you have used all of the options you can't use the app any longer because it wouldn't make sense
1,kintekla,"Hopefully you read the reviews. This doesn‚Äôt work on my iPhone 15PM. Works on my 10.5‚Äù iPad Pro though, but not that great and I don‚Äôt always carry my iPad. Would like a refund but based on reviews, seems like we‚Äôre out of luck. I‚Äôd avoid getting any apps from the developers of this app."
1,Mahatmonito,"I wanted it to work with my old photos, to hug grandpa or grandma, horrible results like arms all over six fingers, completely different face result from the person on the picture. Unusable results. Then only tried to animate old photos, same useless results, worst $5 bucks I‚Äôve spent in a long time."
1,Theronabrt,I downloaded this and wanted to try it but I when I tapped on uploading pictures it didn‚Äôt let me upload any photos and try the app and when I deleted and downloaded it it happened again so basically I couldn‚Äôt even try it
5,goatinatesla,More effect please and keep previous effects or add the explosion is gone now ?
1,Anonymous8$152,Once you download the app you have to purchase the subscription to write ur own props. After you purchase the subscription you only have a limited amount of props you can use and the videos it generates are low quality for how far along so is these days.
1,Sylvi1986,"Too expensive for this quality. You can‚Äôt talk about ‚Äúvideo‚Äù, when it is really just 3 seconds. Work on improvements. There are already better AI video programs out there and don‚Äôt take so much money for this poor quality - for example: movements aren‚Äôt smooth"
2,Irfan dharma,I have paid for a week and created 3-4 animations which came terrible and I tied with other pictures and then it‚Äôs saying that I have exceeded my daily limit
1,Ray The Video Guy,"This may or may not be a decent program, but I won‚Äôt find out because of their deceptive practices.  They let you download the ‚Äúfree‚Äù app, but everything I tried kept telling me to upgrade before doing ANYTHING.  Not going to blindly pay for an app that I can‚Äôt even test when I get the ‚Äúfree‚Äù version."
1,Swagofstyles,I would like to be refunded for this false advertisement of Will Smith eating spaghetti I couldn‚Äôt replicate that or anything even close to that nor do the videos last as long as they do your ad. don‚Äôt you guys feel like pieces of work for false advertising you know you‚Äôre gonna go bankrupt now because of bad karma.
1,Mymomlivesme,"I made the mistake of buying the yearly version because when I started to use the app, I quickly realize that what they marketed was not what the app can do. nowhere in the app is it able to create AI videos like the advertisements they made. basically lost 40 bucks for nothing."
1,Ninja-Bear,"They expect you to review before letting you into the app. Then once you get past all that, you can‚Äôt test without subscribing to their app.   To be clear, this is not a free app. You must pay before you can use it. You must pay before you know the quality of the app."
1,DoNotUse!24,I wanted to experience the hug from my deceased 15 year old son - downloaded the app was not expecting perfection but the finished product was absolute trash! My son and I look elderly.  Patiently waiting on directions on how to CANCEL this subscription   I would give zero stars however that is not an option - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
4,Chicagoboyatheart,"I like the app, but could you extend the length of the video to last over a minute?"
5,Goldenray19,"I have been looking for visualizers for story boarding music and I am SO INSANELY impressed and proud of this app. It‚Äôs real real real. Worth every penny, get it right now‚Ä¶ trust"
3,hallucinacious,"What would really help would being able to use generated videos, and building upon those generated videos to create seamless feature length animated scenes."
1,Jagz0,"This app is something else, first of all it is not promising what it gives, reasoning it doesn‚Äôt let you do anything at all because you have 2 get pro‚Ä¶ its like a pay 2 win. It‚Äôs a waste of hope to get it‚Ä¶ unless you want to pay that is! Congratulations you wasted money‚Ä¶"
5,Fejfyer,Still needs a bit of polishing but truly amazing app
5,Zackmandew,Just now trying it out.  I will be back and let you know how it is.
5,idrismanuelle,I just need to upload better pictures. But so far I am impressed!
2,Glizzy2369,"Only the hugging one semi does what is supposed to, the rest are pretty unpolished. Also there is a limit of times you can make videos, I believe if I‚Äôm paying for something weekly I should be able to use it as much as I want."
1,*El-Nyc**,"Has daily limits, rarely ever produces anything past a basic request. Tried to have a man waking up done 10 times, out of 10 not a single one was what I asked for. Three to four seconds long each video plus for the price totally not worth it at all."
5,Hasty3500,Made my wife emotional created a video for her and her dad that passed away years ago thank u good work
2,AGGIE1108,Love the app‚Ä¶but if I‚Äôm going to pay on a weekly basis to use what the items offered then there should not be a limit on how often we are able to use it!
1,Emtizy,"So apparently even after you pay for the subscription, it has a ""daily limit"" that it tell you no where about until you hit it by accident. It's 5. 5 videos a day it limits you EVEN if you pay for its high cost subscription fee."
1,nickeisha6845,I just downloaded the app after being charged and I‚Äôm trying to do one of the videos to create my own AI and nothing is allowing me to create anything. How is that so after I just downloaded it. I‚Äôm reversing my payment because this app is a rip off
5,KingVon444,Thank you ai please make an exact copy of my dead people üòÆ‚Äçüí®‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πit almost correct
5,Nintendo1981,"Sometimes the people in it move like ghosts, they‚Äôre not realistic like"
3,Gamertimes2,"Good app so far, but on one picture it made me look like a girl. And second why is there a daily video limit when you have to pay for the app?"
1,LuxMundi21,They make you pay for a trial and on top of that you still have a limit of how many videos you can do. The video kept turning my Mexican grandma into a black guy so I kept trying to switch photos to fix it and  it said I hit my daily limit.
1,MeerBando,"Considering the price this is a horrible app to drop money on, I‚Äôd rather you guys get a different ai app with more possibilities and features even thought it may be a little more pricey. Also have no idea how to cancel subscription through the app maybe that‚Äôs just me."
1,Bermudafuntime,I downloaded this app based on what the Facebook ad showed what this app can do only to find that the app doesn‚Äôt do anything that was shown in the ads. I‚Äôve paid for the premium and I will be canceling my subscription and will delete the app from my device
1,ebay&paypalsuck,First day was cool after I purchased a yearly membership for $40 then after two days I wasn‚Äôt able to use any of the fun features like the squishing and cake cutting dissolving and stuff like that now I‚Äôm very limited on what I can use and everything they offer is nothing I need
4,Idkthenfor,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AND NOW I USE IT 24/7  The pretty much only thing is the first second of the AI generated video is ok, one second later the eyes kinda look messed up but, other than that (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû  IT'S AMAZING"
1,Gazmirb,"I can‚Äôt upload my videos and pictures, it doesn‚Äôt allow you to do so. Only makes self ai videos with your request and they don‚Äôt even match your request!!! I requested a refund, i wasn‚Äôt eligible for a refund, no questions asked!!! Don‚Äôt perches the app!!!"
5,nezzyg,So far super awesome! I was a little bummed they didn‚Äôt have any free ones to sample before you decide to payü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,mad_foot,"You have to upload pictures, no problem. I hit the load image buttons on every one of the tools, and it just sat there. Didn‚Äôt open my camera roll, my camera, nothing. Why did I think a TikTok rec would work? So disappointing."
5,Lil Mando Tattoo,The app makes Magic.. we are definitely living in the future.
1,Kenz Ray,This app makes you pay for everything you can't even make a video without paying overall in my opinion I find this app devastating you should not have to pay just to make a video this was ridiculous the worst AI app I've ever experienced.
1,cont246810,"The video quality is terrible , they‚Äôre four second videos and the person barely moves. A lot of the pictures they don‚Äôt. Biggest waste of money I‚Äôve spent on an app. The only star it deserves is it did a good job advertising falsely"
1,Hdjsbshdj,"Asks for review before letting you try it. Always a huge red flag to me. Obviously a lot of fake reviews here. No demo to try before you subscribe. No free trial even. Overall, seems like a terrible product with terrible marketing practices"
5,Jeri Kozak,It‚Äôs amazing what the AI can create just from descriptive text. The videos are spectacular!
3,Austinwb97,I‚Äôve installed it and reinstalled it three times and every time I open the app for the AI tools nothing pops up. It‚Äôs just a blank black screen.
1,tomburns,"Completely stupid to be paying for a service and also having a ""daily limit"" on it. Cancelled because of the ridiculous ""daily limit"" for a paid service"
1,halaindira,I paid for a week to try out the app. But after only 10 generations the app will no longer let me generate images. It‚Äôs also been a whole 24 hours plus since the daily limit message popped up. This app was not worth the money.
5,gyeghyrchdd,Waste of money and time. Doesn‚Äôt generate anything like the examples they show.
3,Butterfly food,You can only do so many per day I think around 12 even know you are paying for the app‚Ä¶
2,ShallTearSilverFox,"I give it 2 stars out of 5. It does a great job and I enjoy it. After paying money to unlock everything, it has a daily limit so because of that I give it 2 stars instead of 5 stars. Oh well."
1,N1ck Nam√©,"This app is not near as good as it is advertised to be and they claim it is easy to cancel your subscription, it is not, you have to send them an email and something tells me they will most likely ignore it and continue to charge.  Do not buy this!"
1,B. Sowards,You can‚Äôt even try any of the app‚Äôs features without paying. They also ask you to write a positive review upon opening the app for the first time. This app must‚Äôve been created by someone who‚Äôs used to getting handouts.
1,Jakethecats,"Most of the videos fail or right now I have one that won‚Äôt finish and it‚Äôs been an hour and I can do anything? I can‚Äôt even cancel it. Don‚Äôt waste your money this is broken, and if you do get it to work it‚Äôs like a 3 second video with no way to extend it"
2,Kamdamramtown,The videos they produce are maybe 2 seconds and are worse quality that the ‚Äúbad‚Äù will smith eating spaghetti example in the ads. Can‚Äôt believe I wasted $5 on a week‚Äôs subscription.
1,MCScammer,"I immediately canceled after learning the outputs are awful. Seriously, the quality is terrible. It feels like they created a library of random slow frame videos and sorted them by keyword. This app is NOT worth your time and money. Please give me a refund."
4,Sigma#75,"It made me a white man, at first.  Then changed me to myself, the second time around, with the same pic."
5,Hrmagoo,"I just made little mushroom people in a video and it‚Äôs so cute and perfect, thank you!"
1,RoboAire,I‚Äôve tried this at least 5 times on the hugging application and it never works right. In fact it created 2 imaginary people in two of them and in one there ended up being 3 of us hugging. This app needs some serious work.
5,mlangana,Enjoy seeing pictures moving
1,Rebecca Anne Vieira,"From the simplest to the complex, it never gives you what you asked for. You'd be better off, searching Google for a small clip, it would probably be closer to what you were looking for. No free trial for a reason, this is pure garbage. A waste of five dollars and I'm looking for a way to get a refund."
3,TheVirtualGuide,When you give a very detailed video description is should be longer than just 3 seconds.
4,Sandpiper 1358,The app is do easy to use. It‚Äôs functional and creates your ideas to the best!  It‚Äôs very innovative and interesting to use.
5,Devilprince666,I love this so much i got everything i wanted within five minutes
5,$ Kimberly $,Just downloaded it 2 seconds ago and it already wants a review .?
1,Mapapla,"I downloaded this app I tried a few features then couldn‚Äôt create anymore , keep saying something went wrong and it‚Äôs been 4 days since and the cool features are not even an option anymore , very disappointing üëéüèºüëéüèº"
1,Thoshall,"Unable to upload any pictures even after giving the app permission to access photos. I removed and reloaded the app, same issues. I even tried the paid version to see if it helped. No good. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
2,seewhynotme,"I could see paying $4.99 a month, but a week. Not this guy. I‚Äôve seen a lot better for less. Plus most of the AI features are poor quality."
3,Y.Kelley,This app doesn‚Äôt make long videos. It only makes about 2 seconds or so. Not worth it.
3,Astro_algorithim,I would pay more to have more daily limit for video creations
1,Yolita5,Literally paid $4.99 for one week trial they don‚Äôt have any free trial like the other apps. I didn‚Äôt mind paying but they did not have the option I was looking for and what I saw in the app and the app keep telling me that it‚Äôs been an error.  Wasted $4.99
1,khorath,After purchasing the app it now tells me I have exceeded my daily limit.  I haven‚Äôt even used the app today.  Are you only allowed to use it so many times in a 24 hour period?  I don‚Äôt see that stated anywhere.  I am going to cancel this app.
1,Flame28168,I have had it for a couple of weeks. I‚Äôve only been able to use it four times. It won‚Äôt let me do anything now. I‚Äôve contacted them twice. No response but they‚Äôre still are taking my money. Don‚Äôt trust this site.
1,Joey56789123,They require you to upgrade to premium before you can even see what the app does and it does not generate real videos. If you want to make moving images then this can be the one for you
1,Jaysees233,I wanted to bring back to life an old image I have and all it does is shake the image. Super disappointed with what it claims. I would request a refund bc that‚Äôs all I really wanted to do with this app. So don‚Äôt waste your money with this program. It‚Äôs just a scam
1,Shin Hati7,Don‚Äôt let the photos fool you‚Äîyour results will not come anywhere near what they look like.  The app UI is slick and looks nice but it‚Äôs very buggy. Rendering videos don‚Äôt take a few mins like the app suggests. And it errors out constantly.   Avoid and keep your money.
5,A Blues man,Great app can create very short videos
5,Jase19869,Wish the video clips were longer and clearer
5,WwwwwwwwwwWjjdjfejjajajsbf,I reallly don‚Äôt care I just want them to like me and give me stuff
1,kazamy,I‚Äôve tried five or six times to get a video that‚Äôs any good. They‚Äôre really poorly done. Overall not worth paying for and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I could have tested it first. Waste of money and time.
1,Aggiesboi,"They only let you make 12 photos a day, apparently they don‚Äôt have a counter to let you know you are nearing a limit nor is the daily limit mentioned in the terms of service."
5,Jesus Beelzeebub,Just downloaded this app and so far I‚Äôm having a lot of fun with it. Very entertaining!
1,NickiElecta,I paid for this so I can have a photo created with my dad who passed and my daughter hugging. It didn‚Äôt change the background to matching. It basically just had them look at each other and then look away.
2,Purchased waste 777,"Worst ever don‚Äôt waste your money, they limit how many times you can create even after paying $5.99  The videos turn out not as expected and low quality."
3,Fran_888,I thought it would create an actual video with the prompt I gave but it‚Äôs just a still photo moving‚Ä¶.
3,Brion JR,"Having a generic AI videos, great, but you should have the ability to integrate the picture of the person that owns the app"
5,03/04/10,My mom died 3 months ago and I was able to ‚ÄúHug her ‚Äú. It made me feel so happy
1,Schelleme,"Just paid 40 bucks and when it says my video is ready, all I‚Äôm getting is an error message that ‚Äúsomething went wrong, try again later. ‚Äú Trying to figure out how to request a refund!"
1,Gs8502,It is not intuitive at all. There is nowhere to show you how to personalize the videos. It generates only what is preloaded. I want my money back after subscribing for the weekly plan becoming disappointed within the first two mins.
1,cjgarrison,"The videos are a process to get figured out and then they‚Äôre short clips like Google search results abut not even useful.  I‚Äôm asking Apple to help refund and that was less than 10 minutes to evaluate.  Clean design, weak AI results"
5,Wes aka blayze,Great art try it out ! Need I say anymore ? Just down load 40$ a year it‚Äôs pretty cool
1,Raff2210,"The hug feature is quite bad, it distorts the two photos into one bizarre creature, that‚Äôs if it works at all. Sometimes it just buffers for 5 minutes only to give you an error message. Do not recommend at all, waste of $4.99"
1,BL975,"After trying other tools, I was shocked to find this tool only accepts minuscule prompts to create something more akin to a Live Photo than a video. I canceled immediately. I was hoping for a tool to create a short, ~90 second tutorial. This tool cannot do that."
5,Guy try and review,It creates 3 second videos. They take about 40 seconds to create. Pretty nice little tool.
1,Jm Itami,"Unless I‚Äôm missing something - nothing works. The ‚Äúhugging‚Äù option doesn‚Äôt work - nowhere near the ‚Äúadvertised‚Äù display. I‚Äôve tried multiple photos, and nothing works. The ‚Äúcome to life‚Äù feature blurs the photo. A waste of $40."
1,Nexus$$$$$,"This app is a joke, got it to make an old video come to life , one person belly moved but that was it, tried another feature as well and it was nothing like what i texted it to be, i would give zero stars so far, basically robbed me of $5"
4,KingTJ Accepts,I‚Äôm sure you guys know. Only thing is it needs more. Just that. Very good still though.
1,Lazlo3182,I paid $5 for the week subscription and was very disappointed. It‚Äôs a still image that moves a little and is nothing like what you requested. And each ‚Äúvideo ‚Äú only lasts about 2 or 3 seconds. 0/10 would not recommend.
5,Mjlady94,Some of these videos and edits really turned out amazing
5,BLUSTR313,Haven‚Äôt seen anything better than this on the market!! Wow ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,RDuBois,I really tried taking the simplest photo of a bottle of scotch to make it explode. 15 different shots and angles and lighting and would never work. It made my cat look like it was shaking in a seizure instead of inflating. Amazing potential but needs a ton of work.
1,sam40mm,"Not only am I being encouraged to consent to ridiculous prices, but most of videos take forever to be created and usually turns out to be very underwhelming. Most of the time the AI barely even complies to your text ideas."
3,MikeLandter,Good but the fact that you cannot exit the app while waiting for a video to be created is annoying
1,ReviewDad1991,This generates the weirdest images that are not at all what you‚Äôd expect and is never close to what you are asking for. They will charge you before you can try it. Red Flag! Don‚Äôt get the year you‚Äôll just be out $40 can‚Äôt believe they scammed me for $5 for the week
1,uvibes,"I cancel my subscription but it‚Äôs still in my subscriptions, and I can‚Äôt download anything now, even if it free, I would like to cancel my subscription and it also said it won‚Äôt be expired until October 27, 2025"
1,TheThisThing,"That by itself isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but they don‚Äôt inform you of this anywhere in the ads. You have to pay a subscription fee to use any of the generators"
1,Wiinnneeer,Cannot even simply make a photo into video. It just zooms in the photo and zooms out. Nobody moves or changes facial expressions. Downloaded this app to make an AI video of me and my parents that passed away hugging. The app could not do that at all. Do not waste your money on this app.
2,kennybosox,"Downloaded based on ad with abilities to tak pictures of people and have them blow up, get squished, etc.  all I see are dancing, hugging, and kissing- none of great quality"
1,Dizzynrss242,Every photo i upload to do something with this doesn‚Äôt work and they don‚Äôt even give you a trial had that been the case I wouldn‚Äôt have paid for this app now I paid for an app I can‚Äôt even use smh üò°üò°
5,Rubenizm,This app will take you where the imagination has no end‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
3,Kaylovely94,I wish the picture stayed more like the original
1,6 mins gone,"Seen this ad on ig and it said it was free. Wasted my time downloading and typing up a prompt for a video and as soon as I hit create (super juiced about seeing what it does), it hits you with a ‚Äúpay me‚Äù screen. Thanks for taking 5 minutes of time that I can‚Äôt get back."
1,ChrissyPoo2,This app does nothing with your photos. I used a selfie of me in a baby blue wig with pig tails and my boyfriend is blonde. They just show the side by side photos then a picture of 2 ai generated people kissing and the male figure had black hair and the girl had cobalt blue straight long hair. It was absolutely no gen AI relation to our photos.
5,Tree doggy,Great so far and extra points for allowing cannabis
5,Allahvel&Syleen,I believe this is what I been looking for to create text to video to bring my Bible studies to life. Thank you Jesus üôåüèæ
1,Jacob Kuenzi,I downloaded cause I thought it would be kinda cool just to find out everything is blocked behind an absurd paywall. It‚Äôs super expensive for what it is and at this point just make the app cost money if I can‚Äôt even use it.
5,Shawfredrick,Very creative very fun very easy to use and the graphics is out of this world.
5,Mophead3,It did what I expected on the first try ‚Ä¶amazing but scary though I love it
1,DinoMagno,This app is total scam. It does random stuff from the prompts that you put nothing does nothing I lost my money. I paid 4.99 for this. And this cannot even generate a video. What does this generate gifts short videos with no quality
1,Dontwasteyourmoney87,All this app does is create a crud image and add repetitive motion making it look weird and unprofessional‚Ä¶waste of money. I thought I signed up for the weekly subscription in hopes of canceling but apparently they make it annual no matter what and charge you $40
5,Ralph nader H,"These is so cool couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes , that can‚Äôt do these is real .  It‚Äôs amazing Universal studios Magic"
1,tomchick,Apps like this should be banned from the App Store completely‚Ä¶. It is a huge waste of time to download an app like this that you can‚Äôt even use without paying money. It should not be allowed. This is a scam. Garbage app garbage app garbage app.
1,Yupp25,You have to try it tons of times to try to even get something okay looking then. It says you run out of times to use it per day yet your paying 4.99 to use this it for only a week seems like a rip off.
1,Pkyesvje,The ad for the app is completely misleading. It does not work as advertised. Pictures and videos are all blurry. Wished i was given a refund. I dont usually write reviews but this app was so bad that i had to share it.
3,shakerah_7,I‚Äôm trying to create a video of a door the opens and that‚Äôs it and it‚Äôs giving me nothing let‚Äôs give more range
1,Snarf_lord,It‚Äôs a cool app and decent ideas but the videos are way too short. Needs to be 1 minute at least. I paid $6 for a week not knowing it just makes like 2 second gifs basically
3,Terry200962,This app would be a whole lot better if more emphasis were place being more focused details with people prompts.
1,Cjpatsfan,They take ai images and basically put a dynamic zoom effect on it. There was an older app that mimics this feature and it‚Äôs just that. No comprehensive moves or anything special. The same ai images you are used to but the slightest amount of warp.
5,)8()',Why I can access the photo Huging
3,Rezitlasamoht,"It seems like it could be cool, but I really don‚Äôt understand it. I wish there was more more education."
1,Shawty-LB,I purchase today the annual plan I‚Äôm regretting I cannot generate any videos I on my see options for couples stuff I wanted cool video options to create for my business now o cannot get my money back no way to reach anyone for support
1,R*******@,"You have to pay just to try it, and even after subscribing, it doesn‚Äôt work. It claims edits take 5 minutes, but you just get an error message and nothing happens. Total waste of money."
1,Chris13524,I keep getting the error ‚ÄúSomething goes wrong Please try again in a short time.‚Äù Can‚Äôt do anything so I‚Äôll be contacting the App Store for a refund since I paid for a year of this. Such a waste of time and money!
1,Linus103079,Multiple glitches - main reason to purchase was to generate A.I videos from pictures; does not allow to upload pictures.  Function does not work
1,Abdul r rahman,The video quality is so bad it‚Äôs like 2frames per second and normal video is 30-60 it takes like minute or 2 to generate a video that‚Äôs literally 3seconds long( that you won‚Äôt be satisfied with)  It‚Äôs not worth wasting time onn
1,MatthewDeMuth,"So you can pay for a week at $4.99, but making a few videos in a day exceeds the daily limit? Hard no, that‚Äôs trashy service. What‚Äôs the point of paying for it"
5,mrerivk,I would like to be an affiliate marketer for your company
2,vivian dav,It‚Äôs not really what they advertise.  Limit videos per day.  Limited options  And the videos are bad quality. They replace your pictures with different people.
2,LUCKYDEVIL,Creating some images it is fine however I would like to be able to edit with some text
1,Landscapeart,There is a reason that they charge you the whole year at the beginning! That is before you have any chance to use the app and see the performance. I want a refund
2,DeadDreadLock,"They do not let you try the app before purchasing. Not even one time to see whether or not, you will enjoy the outcome of his product."
5,Belalva111,It is fun and easy to create personal videos with the help of this AI app.
1,JohnJohn242424,Tried to do the hugging feature and it won‚Äôt let you select anything. Tried to create an AI video and it keeps giving an error that ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù I need my money back
1,PadreSi,"As a certified AI specialist, I can honestly say this is the biggest piece of garbage I ever purchased and I will request a refund. It does nothing that I need it to despite the promises and I‚Äôve only had it installed 10 minutes and many error messages."
1,ghtfghh,"The videos come out choppy and they‚Äôre only about a second or two seconds long. You cannot get a longer video. It‚Äôs not worth the money, save yourself the time and money and look elsewhere."
1,Aka_florida_man,Don‚Äôt waste your time. The video this thing makes are like a few seconds long at most. When I selected the ‚ÄòPixar style‚Äô generated something that looked like a 1980s terrible video game with like three frames as the animation. Useless
1,AnnaSmith52313,Not worth the $5 a week if the videos aren‚Äôt even smooth. It literally cuts from the picture straight to the ‚Äúvideo‚Äù with a break in the visual.  Very disappointed. Not at all as advertised
1,zack 570,In ads it shows you that you can do everything but in real you can‚Äôt do anything before you paid
1,Rawk Chix,"Does not follow the prompts properly or at all and creates something not like described. Not worth the money, let alone free. It‚Äôs frustrating and it takes 5 minutes to not be anything you described. It‚Äôs also just a very short clip."
5,Maximum 17376284883,Must go into depth detail to get what you‚Äôre looking for!
1,Shakes719er,App works but it is limited. I‚Äôve been blocked from generating any new images for over a day now. It hasn‚Äôt reset. The customer service isn‚Äôt responsive definitely would appreciate a refund.
3,JoeJoeJoe1234556678,"This app makes great 4 second clips of video, but you can only create 4 a day.  Spend your money elsewhere."
2,once loyal fan..,Perhaps I‚Äôm new and inexperienced but the app allows you to create 5seconds of looped video images. The video image is constantly morphing into some putty-like monstrosity. I will give a week before I cancel.
1,bahahahabla,It‚Äôs been 24 hours since my last video was made still says out of limit the reason I‚Äôm out limit is because the videos are horrible.
1,explosive diary,"Keeps locking up, not able to scroll or select other options. Also the app description isn‚Äôt accurate. It is a very limited tool. I‚Äôd actually like a refund"
1,mR anOmnymoaa,"I first tried using the hugging option then it said error try later, I tried later then it‚Äôs been like 15 minutes and does not load , terrible"
4,ai jamil,So far so good
1,MyRealGenius,So it‚Äôs not working today? Made 2 videos last night and now nothing works. Very disappointed. I canceled my weekly subscription until this gets fixed.
1,Sym_autumm,It makes you pay for everything I was so excited to use it to hug Ariana grande but no it did not let me so I tried a different one it did not work I was so exited and had high hopes for this app but no it‚Äôs just so ridiculous
1,SxyDeSertStorm,A waste of 4.99 and you have to pay before you can create a video and the videos have no sounds and the images are distorted. Doesn‚Äôt look good or what AI can really do ‚Ä¶if I knew how to request a refund I would.
2,santiago_visuals,"This app is pretty bad, borderline horrible. Horrible quality, and only 3 seconds long video is ridiculous. I paid for the pro version and it is really bad. Not worth the money."
5,Pavi1ion,Dude!  This has to be the BEST program I have seen yet.  The stuff it was blowing my mind!
1,DieselDarlin2500,I just lost my dog a week ago and saw that this would create a video that I could hug him one more time and it won‚Äôt let me upload any of his pictures at all!!! Waste of time and money
1,zeept65,If I‚Äôm paying $4.99 weekly why can‚Äôt I use the app unlimited? It‚Äôs ridiculous. You can only use each feature a few times and then it says you used your daily limit.
1,Und3r6r0und,"The app worked ones, after that I haven‚Äôt been able to produce videos, the squeeze option is not available, fake advertising. I don‚Äôt recommend the app."
1,Jenn L A,This app is stealing money from you to purchase before use and then to find out all their ads are false advertising and the features are not available.
1,Don‚Äôt bother purchasing,Tried several different pictures so far and the image to video and hug option does not work one bit.
5,Rambo Kollectiv,Top notch quick action for outstanding visuals bravo
2,NICOSLOWBRO,It‚Äôs not what you were probably expecting. The app makes GIF quality renderings but the renderings are very accurate based on your input.
1,Dognipples,The very first screen when I opened the app shows overlapping buttons that aren‚Äôt clickable. If they can‚Äôt even create a mobile-friendly app why would I waste my time? Deleted.
2,D of MBW/Real Talk,"The clips are barely a couple seconds and really doesn‚Äôt like anything like the promo. Great idea, needs improvement"
5,Andis Papa,Refresh memories old photos colorize and make them awesome
5,KKhotchkiss,I only did one but I've seen a lot of these. Love it!!!!
1,Kevzek305,"Fake , they advertising with the trendiest ai video but when you want to find the exact ai video you wanted it‚Äôs only 2 or 3 options . and if you see the results you can laugh. 39$ a year I just got scam literally"
1,kfhammond,"No trial or demo, required to pay to use. Low quality 3 second long videos, daily limit with no indication on what the limit is or how close you are to hitting it."
1,rabbit foot 2012,Will not let me access anything from my pictures. The prompt for selecting goes away as soon as you try to click on it
5,PastorManwell,This video is about Man‚Äôs transformation from a life of Sin and Shame to One of Glorified enlightenment and the overwhelming wisdom and power of God to man.
1,Ojsully,Just got the app for the moving pictures and can‚Äôt even upload anything waste of money!! If you buy something it should work and this mess is trash.
1,Leeney420,"This app is ridiculous!! Don‚Äôt waste your money! It keeps kicking me out saying try again, then it makes the video with other people in it. Don‚Äôt do it, you will end up disappointed"
5,Boobaveezee,The first time the team was on a field day
1,Brianbiz,"Save your money choose a different app. The videos are terrible quality and definitely not artificial intelligence. Possibly a monkey working behind the scenes. but anyways, this app is absolutely useless. Not even entertaining."
5,Liljoe1981,This is another example of great fun
1,Sicky Tumetalz,"It‚Äôs a bummer that it won‚Äôt let me rate it 0 stars. If you wouldn‚Äôt have to pay $4 DOLLARS for a FREE trial, plus it‚Äôs not free if it‚Äôs 4 dollars. AND YOU HAVE TO PAY $40 if not. I really wanted a video to inflate my cat, so I tried and it said I have to pay and I cried."
1,Dwnloader,I paid money for this and it never works. Times out. Error messages. I paid money and half the cool features just disappeared. I want a refund now. You have been reported to Apple.
5,Drakeos mom5702,I so love it
1,Lovablelatin1,I tried to upload to the photos for the  hug and it didn‚Äôt do anything. In other categories it also didn‚Äôt do anything. I wasn‚Äôt able to select the photo.
1,Un1que122333,I paid for the weekly subscription and made multiple attempts to use the hugging feature and kept getting an error.
1,Masterc3501,I will never sign up for a monthly paid app before being able to at least test its capabilities. Deleted it immediately.
3,Müëåüëçüëåüëçüëåüëç,I think you should make one daily free video so we can make a video every day
1,3en-Pom,"When you open the filter and press the upload button to add your image, nothing happens. I restarted the app and rebooted my phone. Doesn't work."
1,QueenSpeaker,NONE of the hugging pictures generate as advertised. You end up with the faces of total strangers in the generated videos. The nerve of them to price this at this point with such horrible quality!
1,K9miie,This is the worse add first it don‚Äôt work like ad said second they are you buy the subscription and won‚Äôt give refund not working as expected bad bad bad don‚Äôt waste your time
1,Brad DIY,"I tried the ‚Äúhugging‚Äù feature four times and the image changes into a different person every time. In one, the face gets ‚Äúsquished‚Äù. It‚Äôs not even human.   Go back to the drawing board."
1,abicost,This app just doesn‚Äôt work well at all it‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve gotten the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve reached your daily limit‚Äù for 4 days without actually making anything.
1,THExJAG,"This app promises a lot. The AI videos are fair.  But it DOES NOT have the Photo to AI video.  Zero !  Even though they advertise this feature , the app does not include that.   Also, the result AI videos are super short.  Like 10 seconds.  This app is a ‚Äúflatline ‚Äú.  I don‚Äôt recommend it."
1,Greywolf9r,"This app is not user friendly and really relies on the purchase of the app to use it, am not going to buy into something if I cannot try it, or maybe this is just not for me."
5,Moving Makeover LLC,Thanks for giving this creative tool.
1,GRUBHUBNODUB,"Can‚Äôt use without paying for anything, not even to try it out to see if it‚Äôs even worth a buy. They just care to take ur money and nothing else. ZERO (0) stars."
1,Kitan$,My video takes ( minutes and can not do anything g else or cancel to live to another project.
2,zzzz sfhfy,You have to pay for everything and it so annoying im pretty sure I‚Äôd only ever use this 5 times I‚Äôm not paying a subscription for thatüòêüòêü´§üòëüôÑüôÑ
1,IES.caveman,A lot of other video generators do some free videos so you can at least test it. This one chargers before you try it. I paid and it only generates like 10 seconds of video at a time.
2,Kodiakteddybear,"Before you can do anything you have to subscribe at either $4.99/wk! Or $36 for the year.  You don‚Äôt get a chance to see if the software will even do what you would like it too.  There are other options out there that will let you build a video, review it, and then ask for a fee.  I do not recommend this app for those reasons."
2,Kayscreations,I am so disappointed that there‚Äôs a limit on how many creations you can make. Considering I pay for this app id like to have unlimited use.
1,Honest guy Reviews,"I wish I could give this app 100 bad reviews. It‚Äôs terrible, the images are blurry and it can‚Äôt even generate the most basic creations without severe and conspicuous flaws!! Do not buy!!"
1,OutLoudMedia,I payed for the whole year and I‚Äôm still limited from making AI videos. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even worth it‚Ä¶ but the app is great just don‚Äôt want to be limited on how many video I can make.
5,Riyrosh,"I made a few videos, that‚Äôs amazed me so far!"
5,homesbyamanda,This site is hands down the best!!!
1,Cuddles TX,Very very limited on what you can do.  I guess for a basic tool it can be used. But not as useful or even have the same effects as the advertisement showed.
1,PuR-AyR,This is a very limited source for Ai generating. I really could have used any photo app to generate movement of our photos and in less that 5 minutes to wait for something so basic.
5,rickky1x,Don‚Äôt get it waste of money
1,Fluffy00987,Has not worked a single time on any of the photos I uploaded. I paid for a subscription and haven‚Äôt been able to use it
1,RachelLei6065,"Couldn‚Äôt get two pictures to hug at all, couldn‚Äôt get pictures to move or do anything. It just zoomed out of the original picture. Waste of money."
3,Steffyj72,I just made it and it sent me over here! I don‚Äôt know how good it is yet but I will let you know!
3,Cancel please 13,Fairly decent app I just don‚Äôt want it any longer how do you cancel this app ?
1,LukeM616,"The app purchased a subscription without my consent? And then proceeded to draw the funds from a bank account with less than the amount, making my bank account negative!???!"
1,noledge99,"I was literally looking forward to this app. However, it‚Äôs very glitchy. It wouldn‚Äôt let me even upload my own photos. I wish I can give it a zero star"
4,Prince Saleem Alexis,"Dope graphics. Quick response time, and accurate text to video"
1,HDriffter,Used for one video now all the options to do another video is gone believe the 1 star ratings app is trash.
2,Ken Allsup,What a surprise after completing the purchase that I had reached my ‚Äòdaily limit‚Äô.  Why did I purchase then? Not real happy.
1,NotAIGen,This app is not worth the money spent for the lackluster performance it provides. I tried one custom prompt of a pretty simple concept and the finished product devolved really quickly into randomness.
5,Paxtyn F,I love this app so much it helps me create scenes from my books!!!
5,Deeyoir,To see my brother and sister hug me again brought tears to my eyes. I love it!!!!
1,Jkproduction99,"Bad quality, no refunds, scam, under 4 sec video, taking long enough to generate media, not accurate, weird photos, not worth, terrible art, horrible action, you can't use it for anything, wasting time,"
1,Chinua.S,If you wanting old images to move don‚Äôt waste your money like I did. All this does is put a ripple effect on the image it does not do what advertised. Junk.
1,Marylandb243,I did pay for the subscription. I tried to make a video multiple time different days etc but the app did not give me 1 single video.
1,hesbone,If you have money to throw away this app is it. You can‚Äôt even try it without paying. Download and deleted in 30 second app
5,quishajabri,This app help create a beautiful moment with my deceased Granny. Thank you!
5,Db kano,I love this app‚Ä¶it really is something else
1,xJcub,app instantly ask for a rating on the app store. BEFORE EVEN BEING LET ACCESS TO SAID APP. the. proceeds to take you to the subscriptions that are available. all before being able to use the app fully instant delete
5,Mz Mcgaha,I love everything about this app!
1,Dont-be-unfair,They try to make you think it‚Äôs free to use by putting it for free on the App Store but the app is totally useless and just takes up space unless you buy a subscription. I‚Äôm tired of all these fake free to use apps garbage
1,AJ_3997,Do not pay for this app. It is the worst app I‚Äôve ever used. It totally changes the people in the photos to other people. Every option they have is horrible.
1,Nj9277,I hate that you can‚Äôt stop or cancel downloads. You have to wait roughly 5 mins which is a lot. The AI isn‚Äôt that realistic either.  Also very low quality videos
1,vincejnjp27,Downloaded app to try it out but couldn't even do that. Pop-up appears to buy a subscription. Should add that to the top of the description. Download only if planning on subscribing.
1,Vele v,"This app is a ripoff  I pay for my subscription and nothing works  I deleted the app thinking it was gonna work then, but still not working  I need my money back"
1,Abraham Debasu,"- it‚Äôs paid version app, and it‚Äôs not cheap. - you‚Äôll get only 3 seconds video out of it. - the video quality and the ai pay itself is so poor. It‚Äôs seems real at all.  üõë‚úãJust DON‚ÄôT pay for this app!"
2,Yogaloverpr,"I was cheerful when I downloaded this App but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt do much with it.   The worst thing is that I paid for the whole year.  Maybe it can be good for others, depending on your goal but if your goal is to create video content, it won‚Äôt do much.  However if you want it for posting stories it will be good."
1,strike box –∏–≥—Ä–∞ —Ä–æ—è–ª—å,Please refund my money. This app can‚Äôt generate any video. Always shows try later. And generated video (with my prompt) just very bad. It doesn‚Äôt understand even simple prompt !
1,Steven898,"This app is pointless and doesn‚Äôt work. They ask for money upfront and when you pay, it‚Äôs only one week subscription. Add up to a lot. And the AI videos don‚Äôt work at all."
1,MonieyC,The biggest mistake this app has is that there is no free trial even tho the price is not a lot but I don‚Äôt like not being able to try the App at least for 3 days
2,jond1001,You only get 3 sec vids. Lot of money for such short videos. Would be better to have 30-60sec
2,Theponygirl,This app really struggles at making animals look realistic‚Ä¶ They are distorted and far from anything realistic. üò©
1,Brian .K. M,They are very quick to take your money but make it impossible for you to cancel your subscription.
2,Will F B,"Everything worked fine at first, but then it stopped working all of a sudden with constant errors that read:  ‚ÄúSomething goes wrong. Please try again in short time.‚Äù  This bug needs to be fixed ASAP, like IMMEDIATELY.  Thank you!"
1,Aly_Cat‚ù§Ô∏è,"Well this completely bogus, I was hoping to at least try it out the AI Video app & see how it actually works. But apparently you have to pay for it, so I‚Äôm a bit a discouraged to be honest‚Ä¶"
1,Param9855,"The payment method is manipulative, there should be detailed information about it and it takes so much time to make a video."
1,Hollywood0369,Not all features are working. Disappointed to pay for a year subscription to get poor results.
1,lovecosmetics,Basically paid for an error message. Every retry failed. Apple refused to give me a refund. Very disappointed in both the app and Apple. Hope you use my money well üëç
1,Taptapnuts,I‚Äôm still wondering if app does a good job. Requires payment to try. I‚Äôll go with one of the others since I can try and verify that I like the quality of the renders.
1,El Rey Suizio,"This app won‚Äôt even let you check it out without buying it. And from the sounds of other reviews, it‚Äôs a scam."
1,Brastico,"I just purchased this app, hoping it would work and unfortunately, I am very disappointed. It will not upload any photos."
1,Lig18,"I spent a long trying to make it work, closing the app and reinstalling it but nothing worked"
1,omarhabayeb,No Free Trial provided.  This is because if they did provide a free trial folks would figure out it doesn't work prior to subscribing.  This app is hard pass.  Don't waste your time.
1,Tnadig,"First this app is crashing constantly, fire your programmer. Would we building cars like that, you drive a mile without an issue."
1,Becca123456696969,Maxes out after like 3 videos in a day. Also it‚Äôs very sensitive to back ground people/ things  Don‚Äôt recommend. Waste of money. Maybe if it was free I could tolerate.
1,La_tapatia,"I tried 7 different pictures of my deceased grandparents in different ways and it just says something went wrong, don‚Äôt waste your money"
5,Due2ssd,Gets all the detail I need!! Great detailed program!!
1,Its big Papa,Can‚Äôt even see what you‚Äôre paying for before you pay for it absolutely taking a risk that other apps don‚Äôt make you take
5,the wueen m,Amazing app
2,Ckfkfkjfifrioaiajxjdhs,It‚Äôs too short to make anything cool. And it‚Äôs look faded and warped.  I bought the week. Will prob cancel when week is up. It does make ai pics. They‚Äôre just not‚Ä¶ idk. Not for me.
1,spartacusarena,"You cannot ask the people to pay in advance before they try, do you guys have anyone working in marketing!"
1,eqz453,"Only creates 2 second videos, and a handful of options to make a 2 second video from photos, free apps I have do much more"
1,Ari_Oo,You can‚Äôt do anything without paying and when you do it takes a while to even get one that‚Äôs useable
1,masterperch,"You have to pay to even try it, and of course it‚Äôs awful and doesn‚Äôt have any of the advertised features"
1,JC Phl,"Forget about the hug effect, the others like squish etc don‚Äôt work. Incredibly frustrating and already paid!"
1,Jacobkills20,Tried the squish. Said it would take 5 mins. 20 minutes later stuck on ‚Äúgetting your video ready‚Äù. Straight garbage
1,EmmaKate_,The features that were showing originally disappeared once I paid for a subscription.
5,G74z,Easy and super good videos
1,Randomly21,The hugging app never produced the video. It was counting down from 5 minutes but took longer than that and never created the video. I want a refund.
1,Chris Stax,In a few more years this would be more efficient. It does not recognize most of the commands. In some case it gave me the same video (put in my name & asked for the winners of the NCAAF same video.)
5,760hashslingingslasher,Amazing it‚Äôs blowing my mind with the illustration‚Äôs I‚Äôm so glad with the app
2,MKapoor99,"So far I am getting more of animate still pictures than "" video"""
1,4567Joe,I just bought them deleted the app due to each video looking distorted. People‚Äôs faces in the video were flapping and disappearing if that makes sense. Do not recommend.
1,2fastGPI,Straight junk. The generated videos are very low quality and creepy. You will be very disappointed. I wish I could get my mom back
3,garolittle,App worked only 50% of the time. Very glitchy.
1,cj2115,I pay for this app to use a cake feature and the smashing feature and now it‚Äôs not even there anymore. That‚Äôs the scam. I only had it for like two days.
5,Named apple,I just got this app I‚Äôve been on it for 3 hrs.
5,xrecklessteddyx,Its amazing 10/10 go download now
3,Caelanbo,"Used for a long lost loved one, was very poor quality but still made me emotional."
1,L.IAM80,Wanted to bring some of the photos of my mother to life as it‚Äôs been 5 years since she‚Äôs passed. The videos this creates as something from a horror move!! Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!
1,Ricky84848393,This was so bad I couldn‚Äôt do anything on it like make anything I tried everything but the create button didn‚Äôt work.
2,NitttyB,"No matter how detailed I am, it only creates short clips. Is there a way to create a long video? At least 30sec in length?"
1,kcharles999,Tried uploading a photo for the AI Foops and it doesn‚Äôt even let you upload. Tapped on the photo upload icon and nothing happens. Tried contacting them and no response.
2,abusando19,It needs better long video and better description
1,A master E,Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but it seems crazy to pay money for this every week or year. It‚Äôs like 3 seconds videos and they are very bad‚Ä¶
1,m√¶ttbl√¶nx,Doesn‚Äôt even give you a preview or anything. How do you expect us to pay for this when we can‚Äôt even get a sample of what it does.
2,AppleJames007,"Sometimes it works. But other times it doesn‚Äôt. But when it does work, it works great."
1,SkiestheLich on twitch,"Everything on this app you gotta pay for! Stupid app, I even looked it up and saw that the pictures you would upload get replaced with ai strangers."
1,X11leigh,"Video is totally distorted and looks awful , severely changed the features of my son‚Äôs face. Didn‚Äôt even look like him!   What a waste of $5. Will be deleting the app immediately."
1,Arshad.uiu,I have lost my $4.99. Its too slow and it has daily limits. Every time you upload photos it will show error.
1,Heather12755,I‚Äôve trot a few times it doesn‚Äôt allow you to do anything
2,Your true confidant,Needs more improvement but it generates sort clips of pictures
1,ray_waller05,They want a review before using the app. I‚Äôve used these before and the videos are gifs not videos. I don‚Äôt want to pay before testing an app
2,Empr X,Save your $5. The AI is definitely not ready. I don‚Äôt normally do reviews but I was beyond disappointed with this.
1,Fakeappskiller,"Don‚Äôt waste your time, this is a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app but inside you have to pay even if you want to breath. Waste of time."
1,AsadHimselff,i tried to put in almost 15 videos and it still doesn‚Äôt work for my video they took my money too i need my refund
4,A_N≈ç1S3Y_M≈çNK3Y,"So far, so good. I‚Äôm rather impressed with this apps ability to interpret descriptions with ease."
1,HWANG_FELIX,"If I could give this a 0, I would. It's a waste of time and storage since you can't do anything without paying. Don't get it."
1,Te arremango,This app doesn‚Äôt work all AI VIDEO are super choppy and is very limited on what you can do plus this app isn‚Äôt free you have to pay to get this very bad service and experience!! This app is a complete JOKE
2,Nicedjsksk,"Video to short, 3 seconds maybe. Not following the instructions. Not worth it, can do the same with some other FREE online AI generators"
1,Jasonmerrawi,when I ask the app to create a video like the creation is ridiculous. Nothing seems close to the idea that I‚Äôm asking the app to generate. Please refund my subscription.
3,Dog of Pavlov,Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much it. The app needs more brains. It doesn‚Äôt seem to know sentence structure or grammar very well
5,Trade made easy,Very cool . I can‚Äôt say enough but to say again very very cool
3,800soldier,Needs more options for puting ai effects on personal videos
1,gunnerBMusic,This creates a moving picture at best and is absolutely horrible. Poor quality and the text to video feature is worthless
1,And3089,"This would be awesome if it did not put phony faces and ponytails on men, it takes the photo of  your deceased family members and turns the into unrealistic people."
1,Sick of thisüí©,I cancelled the day after I purchased and they still charged me. I can‚Äôt find any way to request a refund or stop the charges now.
1,Swifter1223,All the features were suddenly removed . Scam
1,I‚Äôm Snap,"I‚Äôve never written a review, but I needed to for this one! Deleted app immediately! Everything on this app is behind a paywall. You literally can‚Äôt do ANYTHING without paying."
1,TADtattoos,"I can‚Äôt upload a pic. I click where it says it and nothing pops up. Tried turning phone off snd relaunching it, nothing worked."
1,ShayyyShayyy30,This app is stupid I‚Äôm not gonna try to make an AI video and then right after it says you have to pay for it and that no I will not do I don‚Äôt recommend this app.
1,cutting the cord,Why is there a daily limit on this? If I am paying for something I should be able to use it uninterrupted
2,kykyembe,"These are two second moving pictures, not videos at all. Very misleading."
1,Thamer99009900,It‚Äôs the stupidest AI system I have ever seen. Literally nothing works. I want my money. All it does is make you look bad and weird and the majority of the AI stuff does not work at all.
1,Az Baragabah,It doesn't provide a trial experience; it forces you to subscribe for $40 to try it!! Any app that doesn't offer a trial option should be completely avoided due to its lack of credibility.
1,ac9_99,"Basically zero customization regarding duration of video, details, how to format prompts, and doesn‚Äôt even look good. You expect me to pay 5 bucks a week for this?"
5,Clout32,Great fun. It is awesome for the kids to use too. Really affordable
1,Little Ugly duck 1990,You are not getting what you are paying for. You can‚Äôt use it with your images. Just for 4 of their options. It‚Äôs a scam
1,NunchuckLion,"I bought the app in hopes I could take a selfie and have myself squished or cut like cake and am unable to add these effects to m own images , kinda dropped the ball there"
1,Infiz,Photo to AI Video is extremely limited and not really useful at all. I feel like the advertising was very misleading. Will be canceling on day one.
5,VICIOUSDOM,"This is realistic , turn your art into reality . Love this app ."
1,Amand delfin,Well I keep trying to upload pictures and it says try again later.
1,Penny*P*,I paid for the pro version and it literally won't let me do anything. Can't even upload photos.
1,chefwahoo,"Doesn‚Äôt really capture what I need it to capture, maybe it‚Äôs the styles and there‚Äôs only a couple to choose from, I‚Äôm just not getting what I need from here ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1,Sizzlesü•πü•πü•π,You have to pay five dollars every week. This is the worst app I ever gotten like every month is better than every week and most apps do every month.üò°üò°üò°
1,Daniil.k,The quality of coverting image to video is not even close to one as advertised. This app is kind of scum.
1,Young.xo,Paid for the full year and won‚Äôt let me upload my pictures to create the hugging filter.
1,trader0701,"No matter what pics I try to turn into a video, it does nothing. Just keep hitting create, but it don‚Äôt do anything. Requesting refund"
1,üòåüòâü•π,You can‚Äôt do anything without paying so they might as well just make the whole app cost money. Do not recommend
1,KelDollz,"Totally Freaking Amazing ‚Ä¶ I just did THE 2  PHOTOS (I had to print screen & crop them) HUGGING AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE REALLY THEIR ARMS HUGGING THEIR CLOTHES AND THEIR FACES, smiles ~ my mom‚Äôs! My sister‚Äôs a tad off but Wow!! I paid the $4.95 for a week! I‚Äôm going to have fun Tku u guys cuz my sister is going to like it I think, I do ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,Timmyttt117,A lot of the stuff you ask for doesn‚Äôt get done and then you get like five uses per day which really limits how you use it.
1,Abdellllllllllllllllllllllll,"I can‚Äôt upload any photos, so I didn‚Äôt get the chance to try it and that why I‚Äôm giving a one star review."
1,Professor OG,"Asks for a review during sign up and wants to charge money for something that can‚Äôt be objectively proven by you. It‚Äôs just another AI cash grab. No trails, not even a single credit to try.  STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Nozzleman3,"Save your money and go elsewhere. Waste of time and money. You have to pay to play, and on top of that the app doesn‚Äôt even work."
2,fkusz,We should know before buying it that there‚Äôs a limit
3,DCPineda,I DL the app and made three ‚Äòhugging‚Äô vids but it won‚Äôt let me create anymore! Why??
5,ASTROBLU351,Stop putting pro+ in that app!!
2,Sswampyy,Why am I paying for it if there‚Äôs a limit
1,Rob11111212,This does not work at all the way it is advertised.  It has base set pre created video that just repeats.  You can not customize video at all.
1,wilbeenotfound,use luma dream machine / lumalabs instead; its free‚Ä¶plus you can extend the video if you want. (I saw a review saying you couldn‚Äôt make it longer so yeahh.) dont waste your money on this app
2,Inst what sould be,"It never makes the video of what supposed to, and whatever it does its like 2 seconds video just"
2,gabeshep13,Censored and not very good all around I had to waste money to find this out I‚Äôd pass on this app if I was you
2,Azval998899,"These ‚Äúvideos‚Äù are 3 seconds long with barely any motion at all, they‚Äôre like gifs. Doesn‚Äôt make great images. The Meta AI on Instagram is free and creates better images."
1,Maxmantt,Don‚Äôt even bother. You can‚Äôt test the App to see if it actually works before being forced to subscribe. How do these scams make it onto the AppStore I‚Äôll never understand. Absolute rubbish.
1,Loveisevol716,This app would be cool if it actually made short videos. Instead it only does 3 second loops that are essentially gifs
1,Utah Vegas dude,My issue is that they have a ad that shows a longer video for ai creation vs what you can actually do in the app.  Not worth that value.
1,roadrunner1918,Cannot generate anything of your own without it asking you to purchase a subscription.
1,DTAY83,I'm sorry but Ai is too new of technology not to have a trail to see if this can do the basics. Every little thing is behind a pay wall.
1,Amanda979797,Got this for the squish video and it just keeps giving me an error and telling me to try again later. Wasted 5$!
1,AMYKKaswell,On the rare occasion that it works:/ Constantly get ‚Äòtry again later errors‚Äô IF it even allows you to upload a photo
1,mother runnner,This app took my money for week and did not deliver AI video! So disappointed- there should be a free trial for such a waste of time if there is no delivery- I want my money back!!!
2,The world news organization,Don‚Äôt waste your money
1,Cali-4nia68,It takes a long time to create the video. When it was finished it didnt do anything. Not like the ad at all. Dont waste your time with this app
5,Gwenna28,I‚Äôm enjoying this so far!!
1,fmicroS,There is no way to test or try this. Do not download unless you wanna pay. It probably doesn‚Äôt even work.
1,Anonymous user h,every time I want to use anything in this app it brings me to pay I tried to use anything in this app and it said to pay
5,OHAnnie8,"Ai video is a great tool to help creators grow, or just to have fun!"
1,oxana alba,This app doesn't work. I can't download any photos. Im allowed to create just a stupid 3-second video with automatic settings. Im gonna get my money back
1,Nonyabuisnessbxtch,Only reason I purchased was to try the image to video and it doesn‚Äôt work
1,billybobnoway,Don‚Äôt waste your money! I had high hopes however it is obviously not you when the photos go in motion! Terrible
1,FunFish,"Yeaaaa my sweetheart and I suddenly changed races mid hug. And our hair styles changed. And our faces. Terribly lazy AI that is just scamming people‚Äôs money. Apple, please do something about this‚Ä¶"
3,iTonio_whadez_902890,It stopped working after the third time of use
1,La receta perfecta,AI video needs to more detail on how it operates the result i have been getting is not as advertised is almost a waste of time and money. Looking forward to cancel
1,SumBummm,Does not look like the ads at all. Also too expensive for the quality of the videos. $54 for what??? UnbelievableüíÄ
1,Cujo5000,"Says there is a 24 hour limit, but doesn‚Äôt define the limit."
1,blingblat,"Doesn‚Äôt make actual videos, more like a picture that slightly moves and can‚Äôt appropriately follow prompts. Just wasted $4.99 for a week I won‚Äôt use ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1,Blair Atkinson,Forced to pay for it before you try. Only 3 seconds pictures just moving.. which is utterly useless.

5,backdoorbanger,Best app on the market
1,TedjwiLson,Don‚Äôt waste your time. It‚Äôs a scam and they will not let you even try it without paying first. You can‚Äôt even see a preview.
1,Kashmariee,I like the idea but every single video came out extremely blurry and was just blurring the faces out . Not worth it .
1,AppPersonReview,The photo upload for custom pix doesn‚Äôt work. Can‚Äôt upload my images. I want refund!!!
1,Ericmagic1,Either the app NEVER works or it takes absolute the longest I‚Äôve ever seen any app to take to create an image‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôm a yearly paid subscriber. How is it possible?
1,Decodingdillan,"Features don‚Äôt work, none of the photo to video features will let you upload."
1,Shanejoe,Won‚Äôt let me download any images. Half of the time the video times out and you have to start over.

1,Devadander,I think paying $40 for a parking spot is a better value than paying for this app. Videos are  5 seconds long and don‚Äôt fulfill the prompts
1,GayHills.com,I have tried a lot of prompts and all of my videos are very very bad. The kind of videos you guys shared in your ads are misleading 100%.
1,MystaPulse,False advertising The advertising of the app made it seem like you can make movies and videos with the proper prompt. You only get 3 seconds.
1,Scotty Tuhoti,This is clearly a scam as it only generates the equivalent of a GIF and it almost never has anything to do with what you asked it to create.
1,arshed76,If there was a trial version before the app ask for purchase it should best. Some one knows if he or she needs it or not
1,MujahidM,"You be the judge‚Ä¶  1. App asks you to write a review during installation before you even use the app.   2. On the VERY NEXT SCREEN you are given no choice but to pay for a paid ‚Äútrial‚Äù that automatically doubles in price within a few days.   It couldn‚Äôt possibly be because they want to take the money and run, right?"

1,potterbrain,The videos shown as examples are misleading to say the least. Every ‚Äúvideo‚Äù I created were choppy pans of a low-res picture. Pathetic. Wish I could get my $5 back.
1,thisnicnameisalsotaken,This app just created 3D pictures and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not going to create a video at all so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs called AI VIDEO. It‚Äôs also super dark and one style.

1,PANTA ARDELJAN,This app doesn‚Äôt work at all.
2,TT Bullyz,"My Honest Review:  I wanted to try the AI Hugging, unable to try for free, I purchased.   AI hugging takes 5+ minutes, because it freezes, so then the app must be closed and reopened.   Half the time the photos do not become a hugging video, instead, one or both photos will be animated separately, doing a range of various things, basically everything except hugging.   AI distorts facial expressions, it‚Äôs almost realistic especially in the beginning but just when you think it has turned out well, you‚Äôll notice some random facial movement that can‚Äôt be recognized as a true human face expression.   I am surprised at how well the hands appear, as 75% of the time all hands look normal or at least passable. Although arms tend to develop odd sleeves or the lack thereof mid hug. And during one hugging video it gave too many sets of hugging arms.   Also one AI Hug video only animated 1 photo, while  the other photo did absolutely nothing, so neither were hugging.   The writing on shirts or in backgrounds become distorted.  I tried cutting the people out and placing on a background and setting the people to scale, then duplicating and cutting the photo in half before uploading for AI rendering, but these attempts were actually worse than just using the original images, perhaps too much metadata for it to work with?  Even by using one half of my ‚Äúshopped‚Äù photo as image 1 and the other half as image 2 (and reversing the upload order) and uploading to create a hugging video, and even though the background of both photos are the same sky, the hugged video generated could not reconcile them together, so there‚Äôs either a split or one half of the sky is zoomed in while the other isn‚Äôt. This was probably the most surprising aspect for me, as I thought surely it could at least get the subjects on the same background for the video, especially when all that was needed was to just not alter the background at all.   I tried the animate one single photo feature, hoping it would create a hug for my photo subjects more properly than cropping them and uploading separately in the AI hug generator, unfortunately it animated the clouds and not the people.   I have not tried any other features, but I expected this app to be as good as or as fun as  ‚Äúthat other app‚Äù back when the cool thing was to generate a business headshot/nostalgic school yearbook photo for profile photos, but unfortunately, this app did not  live up to the expectations I had.   I do think AI Video Tech in general is awesome, however I didn't come away from this app thinking I had experienced any futuristic technology as I intended. I now believe that all the convincing AI Videos must be created by the most advanced computers with cutting-edge programs and operated by elite professionals. Which then makes me wonder why these rocket scientists are creating AI videos with agendas more suited for the conspiracy theorists or paid influencers of the general population.   Advice: If you don‚Äôt have money to throw away, avoid.  If you don‚Äôt have patience or time to waste, avoid.  If you are hoping to create a video of yourself hugging a long lost loved one and you don‚Äôt have at least 3 different photos of that person readily available, avoid.  And if you think you‚Äôre going to get anything in the ballpark of professionally created AI videos you‚Äôve seen floating around the internet, avoid.   2 stars because I can screenshot the video and create an image of hugging between subjects which is nice, although a video like the one advertising the feature would have been better."

1,Tretorius,"In the bustling world of content creation, where video reigns supreme, choosing the right tools can make or break your creative endeavors. Unfortunately, my experience with HUBX AI Video Generator has been disappointing, to say the least. This review will detail the significant issues encountered with this service, including the quality of video production, limited image resources, constraints on video length, and a lack of essential features such as editing capabilities and refund options.  Video Quality Concerns One of the most critical aspects of any video creation tool is the quality of the output, and this is where HUBX falls dramatically short. The videos produced often appear blurry, lacking the sharpness and clarity expected in today‚Äôs high-definition world. This fundamental flaw undermines the effectiveness of any content generated through this platform, rendering it less competitive and professional-looking.  Limited Image Resources For a tool that promises to aid in story creation, the shortage of available images is a severe limitation. Users are given access to an insufficient library, which not only stifles creativity but also forces content creators to look elsewhere for appropriate visuals, thereby increasing the project timeline and cost.  Video Length Limitation Another significant drawback of the HUBX AI Video Generator is the restriction on video length. The platform limits the duration of videos creators can produce, which is a substantial hindrance for those looking to create more extended, in-depth content. This limitation is particularly frustrating for users needing more flexibility to convey their messages effectively.  Lack of Editing Options In the realm of video production, the ability to edit and tweak your creations is paramount. Shockingly, HUBX offers no editing tools, a startling omission that places it well behind its competitors. Users are unable to modify their videos post-production, which means any errors in the initial creation phase cannot be corrected, decreasing the usability of the final product.  No Refund Policy Perhaps the most aggravating issue with HUBX is its strict no refund policy. After committing to a year-long subscription, I found the service woefully inadequate. However, attempts to recoup the costs were met with a firm denial, leaving me financially worse off and bound to a service that did not meet my needs or expectations.  Conclusion In conclusion, the HUBX AI Video Generator is a service that I cannot recommend. With its poor video quality, limited image resources, restrictive video length, absence of editing options, and unforgiving refund policy, it falls short of providing the value and functionality that modern content creators require. Those in search of a reliable and feature-rich video creation tool should consider looking elsewhere to avoid the pitfalls that HUBX presents."

1,Km153,I purchased app but after few tries it said limited tries come back later. When you give money to use an app you would like to be able to use it. I canceled subscription after 15 minutes.im still getting charged now have to go through credit card company to get it stopped
1, ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ îqutiepie,I swear. I just wanted to add me and my friend hugging and it said ‚ÄúoH YoU hAvE tO PaY tO aCcEsS‚Äù And I tried smthng else and again ‚ÄúYoU hAvE tO PaY‚Äù
5,Jen2Uboo,I just did the hub video and it came out perfect. OMG. I‚Äôm gonna hurry up everybody in my family and send it to them for a Christmas gift. Keep up the good work. Bring out more AI videos.
1,Aweeeeee,"So it charges you $4.99 per week, or $39.99 per year, but then has the audacity to limit the amount of edits you can attempt in a day. It‚Äôs absolutely absurd. If I‚Äôm paying that much, I shouldn‚Äôt have a limit to how many I can create! Don‚Äôt waste your money!"
1,Boss_Baby_,What‚Äôs the point paying for a service if your going to be set a limit.It doesn‚Äôt even tell you how  Many tries you get .
3,Mirage2x,"Is ok but why give a limit, which sucks‚Ä¶"
1,Jerrod Gadson,I downloaded and purchased $39.99 on iPhone and nothing works!!!!!!! This is horrible!!! I‚Äôm trying to get my refund currently the time is 1254 on November 5th 2024. Don‚Äôt waste your time!
1,Jadishere,AT LEAST LET US HAVE ONE FREE ATTEMPT to actually sell us the app!

5,hollywoods world,I paid for the week trial and you all ended up charging me a whole year subscription of 39.99$ You only have an email to contact you not a number and is like I‚Äôm emailing a ghost or a robot because until this date nobody answered . Very pathetic
2,D Bruenning,I saw a lot of videos on this on YouTube and they did all of the characters dirty so it‚Äôs a two star
1,103857283957373,App is sneaky with its 77cents/ a week but we‚Äôll charge your for a full year at 39.99 in very tiny print. Was willing to do the 77cents and see how it was but roped into 39.99. Apps not even worth it. AI videos consist of 3 seconds of a static image slowly rotating. Not true text to ai video. Avoid this app if I were you.
1,Tmoble,The app literally hasn‚Äôt worked for 2 entire days even though Pika.ai (the model that they use) has been working. How hard is it to make a mobile wrapper for Pika.ai with preprogrammed prompts that actually works? I‚Äôm about to do it myself at this point. With an AI IDE I‚Äôll probably finish before this garbage app is functional.
1,Rashid07304,"I thought it will be better than invideo.io but it takes only few words and creates 1/2 seconds video. Very disappointed and it has no manual, no guidance, no FAQs üòû"

1,Lord Travis Duncan,Clicked on multiple things to create and nothing was ever created a total waste of 4.99 for the weekly subscription. Save your money and do not give them39.99 for a year

1,go go gadget skates,Give me my $5 back. None of the prompts work. Go back to the drawing board and hire someone that can code.
1,RaeMarie2002,I paid 39.99 for the whole year and you give me a limit of how much i can create on AI video. What a waste of money and would not recommend anyone to buy the app
