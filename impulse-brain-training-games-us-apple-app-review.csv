5,kalsarikannen,"As someone who struggles with some memory deterioration and constant information overload and who takes mental health very seriously, I always look for ways to improve the neural connections of my brain. After coming across Impulse, I figured I would give it a go. I have just completed the 30-day brain workout plan and feel real improvement now: it becomes easier for me to concentrate on the particular task and my working memory seems to be better as well. Not sure whether the same may be fully related to the use of this app, but I don‚Äôt care as long as I see results. I have bought the lifetime plan and consider this as a huge investment in my mental health. Planning to start a new workout but not sure whether to go for 30 or for 10 days. It would be great to see some recommendations after finishing the 30-day plan. Also, I enjoy solving brain-teasers a lot. Just a small suggestion here - would be really interesting to see how other players answered to brain-teasers. The only thing I wish this app have is more training areas, like creativity, brain speed, etc. Also would appreciate more games and exercises (still, worth to mention that the developer adds new content regularly). So, it‚Äôs a legit app and thank you for creating it."
5,Waldrop has a,"So how I love this game is like it challenges you to do all the stuff like if you don‚Äôt know like 5√ó6 with one of my questions I think I got it right maybe so like if you don‚Äôt know that answer it‚Äôs OK it‚Äôs sometimes it‚Äôll be timing you but it‚Äôs OK to get answer wrong like it doesn‚Äôt matter whatever age you are it doesn‚Äôt care but I played this game for like so long I‚Äôve been like a pro but like now I‚Äôve been I my babysitter who‚Äôs name is Miss Vicky I she has this game and it‚Äôs called Impulse and it‚Äôs so fun to play with and like not to play with play and it‚Äôs like so fun, entertaining like I love the sort, the trash and like it‚Äôs just so so fun and like just so fun so like I love it too much that I can‚Äôt stop playing it so like so so so so so so so it should be like sold everywhere like sold online and you should have to pay for it because it‚Äôs such a fun game like I love the money game. Whatever it is I love like the 123 there and just like I love the ghost one. I love Connect Dots I love adding them and subtracting and symbol where it‚Äôs like the symbol where it has like a X for it so I love that game and it is so fun to play with and guys whoever whoever made this game. Please put it all around the earth cause I love it."
5,Nana_Su,"Thanks to this app I now know  personality type and have been more of myself.  Knowing how i am on a scientific scale has helped me narrow down on my strengths and weaknesses and has since improved my ability to connect with my family, friends and even in my marriage. Everyone I know has taken the personality test and has inevitably had the ‚ÄúAhah‚Äù moment. Upon sharing with others we all say‚Äù well that makes sense. ‚Äú This app has fantastic games that are challenging, fun and really get the brain juices flowing as they get harder. I really like the diversity in games and the fact that they all challenge in different important skills. My favorite are the ones where you have to put a box together in your mind and be able to rotate it mentally to see all sides in order to be able to answer correctly. Another good one is the math challenge. Frankly for anyone like me or otherwise with the desire to see the world from multiple perspectives and solve problems with practical yet unconventional methods this is a great app to get short form challenges to stimulate the mind."
3,KotyLinn,"ETA: I got a very nice response from the developers but I think they misunderstood me. I think it‚Äôs fine for devs to charge for their work. My problem is the general trend (incl this app) to not tell you the costs up front. You take a little test, the wend au you, and only then do you find out if, and what the cost is. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good app, I‚Äôm just unhappy with this business model, which seems to be ubiquitous now. Tell me up front what you want me to pay. Let me decide before giving you personal info and my time. That‚Äôs all.   There‚Äôs a current trend for companies to initially lead you to believe they‚Äôre free, then they ask you data gathering questions that also hook you in so that by the time you realize they want money, you‚Äôre primed to just pay what they ask. This app may be very good, and I don‚Äôt have a problem with them charging; the amount is not unreasonable. However I do have a problem with them not being upfront about it being a paid app. If it‚Äôs so good, why not let people know that you know your worth and tell them immediately that you‚Äôre charging? As I said, this is a pretty common trend rn so I don‚Äôt blame this app specifically, but I find it to be a sketchy business practice and it turns me off from paying, even the small amount this app is asking."
1,chadcwk,"This really rubbed me the wrong way. I saw this on a Facebook ad and was going to download the app (because it looked entertaining) until I saw their claim: ‚ÄúOnly people with ADHD can solve it.‚Äù Your claim is that NOBODY else is able to solve your game and that ONLY people with ADHD can. Unless you provide your evidence or research, the claim is ridiculous. I will delete my statement if you do provide proof. In the future, don‚Äôt pretend you can diagnose people with a disability if they can solve one silly game as though you‚Äôre a licensed medical professional AND DEFINITELY please don‚Äôt use a disability as your marketing strategy. It‚Äôs unethical, dangerous, and rather pathetic. If it‚Äôs a joke, shame on you. This is a shinning A+ example corporate greed and why people don‚Äôt trust corporations and their marketing campaigns. I have a screenshot of your claim if needed. The CEO and the marketing team are insensitive to people with disabilities and should be embarrassed. I was forced to download the app to leave the review (didn‚Äôt even open the app). Now I‚Äôm deleting it. üëã UPDATE: Here‚Äôs their response‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù. I love the canned responses here. The developers probably didn‚Äôt even see my complaint. Or, these people just don‚Äôt care about their fake medical claims. How sad. I truly hope Apple makes them remove their false claim."
5,woonbdsfjkjrruu,"I do my brain training every morning and also enjoy the games that are not part of my daily training throughout the day. The daily training helps with brain function and speed and some games are timed. The additional games and puzzles are relaxing while still using your brain to think and solve puzzles and games of your choice.  I feel it helps me on a daily basis, especially with my job. I throughly look forward to playing this every day and also in the evenings.  I did find one small glitch that I do not know how to share the information and screen shot with the developer. It‚Äôs a game where you are shown a group of numbers, and the goal is to find the missing number in the sequence from another small group of numbers. In this case I was instructed to ‚ÄúFind the missing numbers in the sequence from 1 to N and tap on the correct answer. Of course N was not a choice because it is not a number.  Definitely download this free app and have a blast while keeping your brain young and healthy!"
5,"frisk, chara, and sans","I don't exactly pay for anything on the app store considering I feel the need that I don't have to. It's hard finding good and productive apps to help me succeed mentally and keep me on the right track, most of them are in-app purchases and you can only get so far before you can't do anything else without paying. Impulse is a good app for letting you use the app for free for however long and you can pay for more options if you feel free to. There are different training exercises that focus on different parts of your brain, it will also show how you did after the game.   The app gives different games everyday so even if you complete all of the games you can play more the next day and repeat. The app helps me most with memory since I can't remember a lot of things, it builds strength to the brain and its very beneficial. The app keeps me from getting bored and it's educational, kind of like when your a kid and you don't realize the educational games are helping you learn since your having fun in the process."
5,AlienX_MT,"If you‚Äôre looking for an app that‚Äôs fun, relaxing and keeps your mind occupied/focused, this is it. I‚Äôve only had this app for a short period of time but I can already say I enjoy it so much. I haven‚Äôt been in school for years, since then I‚Äôve been working full time but I always felt the need to keep my brain active and this app does just that. There‚Äôs many different games, puzzles, quizzes, etc to choose from and the best part is that they keep track of your progress throughout every different criteria. An example of a test I took was the Personality test and let‚Äôs just say after I learned my personality type I realized a lot about myself . I‚Äôm not saying the tests are 100% accurate but for me at least I benefited from finding out. I even did my own research on the personality type impulse gave me and it was nearly spot on for the type of person I know I am personally. Definitely check out this it. Btw there are ads but you can skip them, I find them Annoying so I‚Äôll probably end up subscribing for no ads."
3,kurt.iss,"So I‚Äôm fine with ads. Shoving them down my throat does absolutely nothing to encourage me to pay. Lol instead I don‚Äôt pay just out of spite. But when you show a questionable ad that only got worse once I tried reporting it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when there‚Äôs a problem. Especially since I‚Äôm good at certain games and after every level there‚Äôs an ad. Which is fine.. but not when it‚Äôs showing a woman bending over with her behind arched up as high as it can go so that it‚Äôs eye level with a dude basically sniffing her snatch.. If I wanted to see that all that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd go watch porn on a platform made for porn. Not an app that‚Äôs rated ages 4+ with no way to report such ads. Obviously it‚Äôs not straight up porn but it‚Äôs so implied that it looks like you‚Äôre watching porn. Fortunately I found a loophole to skip all ads. If you add a report feature that will allow the user to stop seeing ads from a specific company/developer (because the developers make several different ads), then I‚Äôll go ahead and tell you how anyone can skip the ads, without violating any terms and conditions.  Edit: I‚Äôm not turning on personalized ads to change what ads I get."
5,heyarron,"I saw this being advertised on Instagram and had been in the mood to get back into brain training. I truly believe everyone should have a brain training app, but this one beats them all. I‚Äôve used the competitors BAXK in the past when I was in high school, now that I‚Äôm older, I can say this one has a more in-depth method of training and the games are really addicting. So much so I don‚Äôt want to do the recommended games, I want to play them all! But strict habits are good long term so I keep reserved, haha. Anyhow, they have different areas of brain training. You have your daily, then you have certain sections, I.e: Memory, Mental Math, etc. I got the 50% lifetime and honestly best money I‚Äôve spent. If you want to sharpen focus, mental math, or even just feel like you‚Äôre not as ‚Äòsharp‚Äô as you used to be, you need to get this app and the subscription to follow. IQ tests on here and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never seen those other apps have. Grateful for discovering this organization. I don‚Äôt even write reviews but this is one that had to be written."
5,Mganwe Shikoto,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but in this case, I decided to make an exception. So glad I came across this app a few weeks ago! Thanks to it I finally realized how poor my math skills are... But the thing is they were not like this all the time! Back at school, I was really good at math, not the best in the class, but really good! And look at what happened... I avoided doing some simple math on my own, thinking it would save me some time (or maybe I was just lazy), and as a result, having faced the tasks in Impulse math category, I saw how big my problem is. Huge, actually. The tasks and the games are not that difficult, they really aren‚Äôt. And back in the day, they would be a piece of cake for me. And now it feels like starting all over... But the good thing is that doing it with the app helps! I‚Äôve been getting better and hope for more results!  My only suggestion would be to include more games to the Language category, just like Math it seems really useful. Oh, and the math lessons! They‚Äôre amazing! But it took me time to find them. Thank you!!!"
4,kkunicorn321,"Since I‚Äôve added this to my daily routine I‚Äôve honestly felt more motivated and have been doing well with thinking on my feet, which I am very grateful for. However, in the app they bombard you with deals off the premium subscription, they give you up to ‚Äú96% off!!‚Äù Claiming it‚Äôll only be there for a while, which isn‚Äôt really true. It doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay though because you can still play some games, and you can complete your daily challenges without premium. My big issue is the tests that they have. Some include trauma response tests, IQ tests, etc. I wanted to do one, so I took the time to complete the test, and then only afterword was I told that I needed premium to see my answers‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm not here to beg to make the app totally free, but at least state a somewhere clearly that you need premium to unlock your answers. Or just don‚Äôt allow people to take the test unless they have premium. Anyway, that‚Äôs pretty much the only thing I have against this game, and all in all it‚Äôs been a great addition to my daily routine!!! Thanks!!!"
4,MinaMayneminks,"So far I have played the game for two days and I like the fact of being challenged . and not knowing what to expect next. This game so far seems to give me a challenge based off of things that we have to deal with every day in daily life issues. Whether those things are good things or bad things, things that you have to ponder on etc. it challenged you and took you out of your zone that you may have been in at that moment. I‚Äôm looking forward to learning new things expanding my brain span ,and being challenged daily, because what I‚Äôm beginning to see go on in this world‚Ä¶ we need to stay woke ,and pay attention to what‚Äôs actually happening before our eyes while being distracted with daily nuances. So we all need things that we can focus in on daily, to help keep us focused on what‚Äôs important .I think this game will be a segue into that for lots of people that find it hard to multitask at times, becauseWe get distracted. Being able to focus is important for anything that we do in life, and I think that this game is just fun tool that could help."
5,818383893,"I love the new game each time, and how they begin easy to learn how well you do.  The game said that the next time the game will be harder, but for the week or three that I finally started playing it (my adhd daughter recommended it to me because other games would bore me as soon as i got really good at them.   Each game has benefits, an example is one where you had to remember which squares had a football helmet, representing opponents. They disappeared and then two footballs appear. You have to make a path from one football to the second without using the square a helmet was in , using only your memory.   They do a tutorial and just allow it to play out, don‚Äôt rush it, and you should then fully understand how the game works.  You never play the same game twice in a row.  (Unless you select replay). It‚Äôs helpful for neurodivergent people and anyone who wants to help their memory skills develop.  I really enjoy it, but I think that‚Äôs obvious by now haha."
5,NoraJ.K,"I didn‚Äôt expect I need anything like Impulse, but after watching the ad on Instagram I decided to try. And I‚Äôm so happy I saw that add!! The app is amazing, user experience is so neat and the color scheme is perfect. What i like the most is that I only need  5 min per day to stretch my brain muscle. So I complete daily brain sessions and feel really better (on a 17th training day now). Pricing is a bit tough in case of taking a monthly subscription, but I successfully utilized the Christmas offer the app proposed. Just for the price of 4 cups of coffee I now can have lifelong brain training!! I would advise the developer to add some brain music and sounds, say for focus, productivity, concentration (I personally consider this to be crucial for effective working or studying). Apart from that, are you planning to add some training streaks? I noticed in other apps that this feature motivates me the most. But anyway the app is great and i recommended it to my friends and family (and i‚Äôm not the type of a person to recommend every stuff i see)"
5,gaisbdvdiwowbdv,"its a really good app, really works the brain and etc. I have a bit of ADHD so it gets kinda hard to focus on it without gettin overwhelmed with the repetitiveness in some of the games. It really the games are really fun tho, puts your brain to work. To me the repetitive games are hardest because again, ADHDüôÑbut its helped me a bit with being more focused and believe it or not, you can get better with being more observed and pay attention to detail a lot more, it helped me a lot! Right now i‚Äôm 20 yrs of age and plan on having children with my gf. If any of you people are parents and see that your kid is struggling in someway educationally, i advise that you download this app and get them into this. I definitely plan on gettin my future kids into this; it can really help them get more focused more organized and so on. It even gives you back the results/reports of what you‚Äôve done. But yk with any app you gotta pay for a plan to get em(but hey, they gotta make their money, can‚Äôt hate on that)"
5,not hardworking for me,"This app is AWESOME I‚Äôm talking AWESOME. so first off, the app has ads only every once and a while, not every second and they are pretty chill because you only have to wait five to ten seconds to skip. They also have sales that one times gave 92% off of a premium package just because I picked the right box. You can also just remove ads for 5$ without ur having to buy the whole premium package. The app is also so fun for an adulation and mind game. The mini games that they do are so fun!!!! And yet it also tell you what it will improve on. For example one game might say at the bottom, ‚Äúimproves creative thinking‚Äù You can also start a streak and play little work out games every day. I honestly love this game so far after I got it YESTERDAY. I play it every day before bed or in the day when I‚Äôm bored because it‚Äôs usually hard to find fun games without getting bored of them. So I think this is the perfect game for all ages and all genders. DOWNLOAD IT IT‚Äôs WORTH IT"
5,BetaPreacher,"It‚Äôs great so far! I originally got it when I saw the AD on tik tok. I thought it was gonna be another bad app, but it‚Äôs actually not. It actually gives you exercises and games and tests that allow you to see things in a different light and jog your memory on things that maybe you need more focus on. For me, I need focus for my job. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to focus sometimes because I have so many things in life that I‚Äôm dealing with, and I get cluttered. This allows me to be active for my brain in my off time, because honestly, everything else started getting boring, even Tik tok! It doesn‚Äôt feel mindless and boring, allowing me to at least grow while in my spare time and not wasting seconds, hours, days on mindless entertainment. The best part is that they‚Äôre not the same questions every time, math problems, vocabulary questions. If you need touch ups on your brain and maybe need to learn something new, this is the app for you!"
2,cakb777,"I got this app thinking that I could relax by doing some fun puzzles for free. I have never seen so many lengthy ads that force you to interact with them as I have in this app. Due to the annoyance of having to deal with the same lengthy ads after ever one or two free activities that I did in the game, a pop up came up saying that I could get the great deal of having ads blocked for $2.99. I went ahead and did it. Then I kept playing and ads kept popping up. When I contacted the app customer service about this they replied that the ad block was only for that one specific puzzle out of all of the activities in the app. They also said this was ‚Äúclearly stated‚Äù in the pop up, which with I disagree. All I saw was the words ‚Äúad block for 2.99.‚Äù If I had known, I would not have paid for that and I would just have probably deleted this app. There are other comparable apps that are interactive and good for different types of brain training, albeit in separate apps, but unless you pay for this app (which is actually a subscription either weekly or yearly) it is too frustrating to use."
1,AustinC96,"This application is partnering with algorithms that harvest user data such as Instagram and Tiktok in order to push fraudulent advertisements tailored to individuals that are more likely to click and buy a subscription. I have ADHD. My TikTok and Instagram algorithms know this. I recently started seeing Impulse ads on both platforms that states ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS YOUR ADHD TYPE? TAKE THE TEST‚Äù implying that, within the app, there was some sort of ADHD type test. I thought ‚Äúthat sounds interesting‚Äù and started a free trial. Interestingly, this test was nowhere to be found. I thought ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs a premium feature?‚Äù so I mistakenly subscribed for $6.99 (I will be getting my money back from Apple). Nope. No ‚ÄúADHD type test‚Äù anywhere. In fact, upon googling ‚Äúimpulse app ADHD test‚Äù I was shocked to find there are NO results except for the TikTok and Instagram ads themselves. Then it clicked, that this developer is utilizing apps with access to marketing and personal data to push fraudulent ads in a targeted manner. The brain-scan images that the company used in their advertisement, hilariously, have nothing to do with ADHD. They are stolen from an academic paper.  ADDON - THE APP KEEPS DOWNLOADING ITSELF AFTER YOU DELETE IT. This is absolutely malicious"
5,Lil Baby 41,I have been working in private home health every since I was a kid about 8 years old when I turned 18 years old I started working in the nursing homes and other medical facilities that involves the elderly it‚Äôs been over 10 years ago when I started working with Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia patients which I owe it all to my grandmother on my dad side of the family she was my first patient I was totally honored to take care of my grandmother she took me in at the age of 14 I wanted to make sure I was giving my grandmother the best of care any known to mankind we did card games board games word puzzles word search puzzles even coloring I wish this was out when my grandmother was still alive I know she would‚Äôve enjoyed it just as much as my patients I take care of now I got patients at the age of 60+ they look forward to playing these games so please keep up the great work just a positive reminder this is changing lives and we are all grateful üòá
5,johnybeast1,"An amazing discovery for all those who search for self-improvement. I wanted to use my time in commute in an efficient and fun way and that's why I searched for brain games in the first place. Impulse absolutely lived up to my expectations! I love their workouts - a little bit of work every day gives me a sense of fulfillment, it's not that I just played some goofy game on the phone, I actually DID something to develop my memory and improve focus. One thing to consider there is the brain-boosting habits, maybe it's worth paying more attention to them? Very often they seem appropriate and cool, but since they're not explained or anything, I just ignore them. If the workout is not enough for me, I can always go to the games and spend as much time as I want playing whatever game I like. My favorite category is Focus, so I play it the most, and recently I noticed that it became easier for me to concentrate at work. Probably, I'll try to binge-play other categories as well, hope the results will be just as good!"
5,Kar¬•n,"Must say impressive and actually pretty cool. Didn‚Äôt know if I would actually like it as much as I do. I haven‚Äôt tried all the options they have like the ‚ÄúIQ‚Äùand ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù type, right now I‚Äôm just training my memory along with keeping my brain & mind sharp. And the games provided for the level im on is pretty intense and exciting. The levels increase in difficulty as u pass each one. Which is where the intensity comes in for me. I only do it for 5 minutes a day. Bc I don‚Äôt want to get to addicted to it. I think it‚Äôs to late for that now.  I always read the reviews before downloading or putting my time into one much less leave my opinion on a review. But this one was actually worth it. So good job to the developers and everyone behind on the making of this which took some talent and time. Very satisfied!! ü§©ü§© will keep playing until it won‚Äôt let me play for free anymore."
4,SpookyCatsandPJO,"This app is okay. I had it recommended to me by a friend, who said that she thought it was amazing. So I was disappointed when the game started giving me ads after pretty much every game. Not to mention these ads would always lag, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to close the ad or even participate in the playable portion, because the ad would be lagging or frozen to some degree.  Another issue with this app is the games and the way most of them judge wether or not you pass. They compare how well you did to how well you did compared to ‚Äúyour peers‚Äù what peers? There‚Äôs a thing people say, you shouldn‚Äôt compare yourself and your success to the success of others. This app directly goes against that saying! I don‚Äôt care if I did better than 2% of my peers, I‚Äôm just doing the best I can for myself, and it‚Äôs really challenging to have to keep doing it over and over just to reach some random number like 76%!!   I think it‚Äôs a pretty hood app overall, but could definitely cut back on some of the ads."
4,username's taken.,"More of a support ticket but, certain question on the test such as, ‚ÄúDo you tend to think in more images or words?‚Äù Only has two responses. Though, while I‚Äôm sure that most people only can pick one or the other, I tend to think in both at the same time if possible. Answer choices such as images or words exclude those who think in both. It‚Äôs just a suggestion that you add more moderate answers for a couple of the questions, or all. The other tests I personally didn‚Äôt have too much problems with, yet I‚Äôm sure someone will complain anyways in the same way I am. It‚Äôs a great application that helps those who struggle with certain things, such as memory, strengthening your peripheral vision, focus, and more. The games are also engaging and easy to get into. So if you‚Äôre a person who is looking to acquire this application, get it, it‚Äôs worth it. To the developers, this is just a suggestion, you don‚Äôt have to follow through on it. Good job, keep it up!"
2,Level743CandySorter,"I got some really misleading ads for this app over the summer, which claimed ‚Äúfind your ADHD type!‚Äù And I was really curious, so I downloaded it. Well‚Ä¶only the paid version will allow you to take quizzes and see results so I bit the bullet and paid for the year subscription, which was ultimately the best value. I‚Äôll use it all year for brain training I thought! Well I set it up and started taking available quizzes‚Ä¶ turns out there are only like 12 quizzes, and ‚Äúyour adhd type‚Äù is not really one of them. It was more of a ‚Äúdo you have adhd‚Äù quiz which you could easily find elsewhere onlkne, and I and my doctor could already tell you the answer to that! Other quizzes are basic personality or IQ tests. I fell out of routine with the brain games and fixated on the candy sorter game. Now it‚Äôs my doom-scrolling-anxious-compulsion-look-at-my-phone-forever game and it‚Äôs the only part of this app I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm just disappointed that I paid $50 for it. A bad investment for the habitually anxious or inattentive. But I‚Äôm at level 743 on the candy sorter game (which doesn‚Äôt get harder after level 100)"
1,Mortal Fool,"Nope. Don‚Äôt go near this. I have never heard of this app and certainly didn‚Äôt agree to subscribe weekly (who pays $6.99 per WEEK???? ) but have been charged for more than 6 months until I finally noticed the small charges hiding among other charges on my credit card. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs intentional so that when someone accidentally subscribes (Again I do not think I did. I know not to press that button for a free trial and get sucked in) then they get $$$ out of you.  Apple won‚Äôt consider a refund except for the last week. Shame on them! And they threatened that if I take it up with my credit card, my whole Apple account will be deactivated. A quick google search tells me they will do so. So basically bullying me. I have NEVER disputed a subscription or  in-app purchase in many years as an Apple customer. Not once!  I am educated and technically literate (my degree is in computer science) so it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm an idiot and don‚Äôt know how this works. If I made some mistake that signed me up for this, it would only be because it is set up to trap people. Predatory practice!  I‚Äôve reached out to the app developers and no response."
5,Iabes,"The games are pretty fun to play and it also tells you how well you did relative to other people in your age range which gently motivates you to do better (if you like competitive games) while also keeping you updated on your progress. Some of the games are similar to the sort of testing I had done during my neuropsyche. eval. for ADHD so I feel like that adds to its credibility of being a brain-stimulating app. I also like how they paced the increase in difficulty of each game. When you‚Äôre further along in a game you can give feedback on if the last level was too difficult or easy which adjusts the next level accordingly. The games definitely feel stimulating to say the least, plus there‚Äôs a bunch of em so you‚Äôll likely not get too bored or just good at one game if you play with the intention of bettering your brain.   P.S. the UI is very user friendly"
1,Sergey Gutsko,"Happily was utilizing their free trial period that implied that all features and games would be unlocked, so I also took an IQ test which lasted for fifteen continuous minutes. First, notice that the tests have an almost hidden disclaimer at the very bottom of each test overview that states: ‚Äúfor entertainment purposes only.‚Äù I overlooked it so I took it anyway, and then at the very end they give you a sneak peak of your results and then ask you to PAY even if you‚Äôre already on a free trial. What a scam. I was excited so I paid for a weekly subscription anyway, but notice how they don‚Äôt mention this ‚Äúdisclaimer‚Äù on the purchase screen, they just do everything they can to minimize cutting you off the lead and take your money. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs really dumb, much wiser would be being more transparent with their customers to build long-term trust and reputation. But this‚Ä¶ this is no different from other mainstream ‚Äúbrain tests‚Äù and ‚Äúexercises‚Äù you find on the web‚Äîwhere all they want is just your cash. The test result wasn‚Äôt even comprehensive, no mention what scale they used or base for questions. But my money is already gone. Obnoxious."
1,NevilleIsHott101,"I downloaded this app to check it out, so I started with a 3-day trial.  I immediately liked the games it took me through but upon exiting the game, I got an alert that my credit card was charged IMMEDIATELY for the trial I started today.   In addition (though this is often the case!), the quiz shown in the ad for the app is not even remotely what is offered in the app itself.   In addition, since even the three-day ‚ÄòPro‚Äô trial leaves many things behind a paywall, I went to buy a weekly subscription, with ‚Äúcancel anytime‚Äù clearly marked and highlighted, I got charged for an entire year at once.    I thought the quality is good, I appreciated the opening quiz, and I liked the sense that there‚Äôd be a path to follow‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt trust this game to be responsible with how it marks subscription fees, and I‚Äôll be uninstalling it and disputing the charges.   I think developers work hard and deserve to be paid for their work ‚Äî and I would have enjoyed keeping this app and paying for a subscription, but I don‚Äôt feel I can trust this particular app to not lead me down a rabbit hole of requiring more and more money to view content.  Bummer."
5,georgiablondy45,"I am a recoverinopen brain injury from about 10 years ago. My mind is not as sharp as it used to be and I have a very hard time remembering things, especially my short term memory. This game has helped me tremendously and I can actually feel the difference in parts of my head that haven‚Äôt been used, (if that makes any sense) in such a long time. Granted I‚Äôm not the fastest one to complete the task but I do get it done. I can tell a slight difference within my memory issues and Ive only been doing it a couple of weeks. It feel so rewarding to know that I can ‚Äúwake‚Äù my brain up in certain areas. My neurologist recommended a application just like this to try and get me healthy results and it makes me feel so much better  no more embarrassing moments when I can‚Äôt remember something mid sentence. Great app, I love it and would most definitely recommend it to neurological patients."
5,ashleyenicholson,"After going through chemo a few years at 30, my brain doesn‚Äôt function the way it used to. I love this bc it‚Äôs helping retrain my brain, improve memory and executive function skills. I had to do this with art too, to get my creative mind back. I always enjoy brain games for stimulation, I had it for one night, found myself playing it til 1A Ooops and decided to spend the $40 for the lifetime game. I like to invest in my health and this will be sooooo beneficial to get me back to my A game.   I was going to neuropsychologist and she gave me similar exercises. This is so much more cost effective than medical bills! They still don‚Äôt really know what causes chemo brain and there aren‚Äôt really therapies out there for it, so I‚Äôm all about trying anything that will help! It‚Äôs totally worth it, coming from someone who does not buy apps and uses free version of games‚Ä¶I made the exception for this one! ü§çü§çü§ç"
5,Awesome Spiritual Mentorship,"I am a Veteran and I have since developed different neurological disorders that prevent my brain from functioning ‚Äúnormally‚Äù. It has progressed to the point that I have to put things into my calendar in order for me to even remember the event at all. I played the trial version of this game and saw that it was challenging. It is Definitely Worth the money IF you have the budget for it. Sadly, most of us with brain issues have so much medical expenses that a helpful game like this, which I believe would help stabilize my brain functionality from deteriorating even further, is just not feasible in the budget.  In short, gift this game to someone in your life who is having issues with their memory and love to play daily play games to help with cognitive thinking, It is So Worth the fee!! Thank you for listening beautiful ppl! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,endjusbsisbsvsuwbwba,"While I know that essentially trying to lie to your customers to make a sale is the meta here: I‚Äôd really like to encourage the creators to stop. I‚Äôm now 10 times more suspicious and unlikely to download an app ESPECIALLY if they‚Äôre running ads on apps like tiktok because so many of yall just can‚Äôt be honest upfront. Offer the FREE assessment without needing my personal info and include some trial content. Tell me upfront what the premium is. If I like an app/product I‚Äôm likely to want to invest in it, and do all the time. I have zero issue with developers making money: I have an issue with using dishonest and manipulative tactics to make more sales. Take the ‚Äúfabulous‚Äù app for example. They disclose from the very beginning that a good part of their app is paid but offer enough of a trial and information for me to make an informed decision. I‚Äôve been subscribed for 4 years to them and as long as they remain honest and make a good app, I‚Äôll keep doing it. What I won‚Äôt be doing is giving money to a company who doesn‚Äôt think their app/product is good enough to stand on its own without manipulation of the consumer."
1,BAlexT,"Before I spend money on an app, I‚Äôd like to go read what kind of interaction the developer has with the reviews. this is just a bunch of canned responses sent from the developer. They don‚Äôt even read the critiques they just throw something out there that sounds like it might address it. So if you can‚Äôt bother to even look at the reviews are getting you‚Äôre not gonna pay attention when I have an actual complaint, so no money. Also, they like to say on all of their responses, you don‚Äôt have to pay to use this app, but you have to sign up for a paid subscription to get three days free trial and if you look at some of the reviews it‚Äôs very difficult to stop them from charging you anyway so I have no reason to trust them. What kind of response are you gonna give to this one? So the response is automatic, they don‚Äôt really care about what you have to say. They invite you to contact them directly but if they were actually reading the reviews, they would not have to ask you (the reviewer) to do more work, because they can‚Äôt be bothered."
3,Get it together BOSE!!!,"This is an interesting app. I have played a lot of mind training games. They are some of my favorite apps. This one is just ok on the brain training. One thing Indo not like about this app is the constant 99% score.  No matter how well I seem to do in different categories, the top score is 99. As an educator who specializes in success strategies, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Like the developers want me to keep coming back over and over to get that 100. I find this concept less motivating than beating a high score or something.  Sometimes some of the games do not set up correctly. I actually paid for a year of this app and then requested a refund for this very reason. This challenge added to the low motivation to create a less than ideal brain training app.  I would definitely compare this app to some of the others. If you want food archetype info this app will break that down for you. But the brain training is better found elsewhere."
5,moon@bookstore,"I fear brain doctors, for their worth of advice. That is all ‚Äú it is called a tooth‚Äù when first started legal tests. I was told I would have a different reflection other than what I am ,  I am here taking this review lightly! And I want to learn self inspiration out of the many things I had to learn and do. Thank you for the app! I will use it to the best of my conscious betterment to evolve a better connection through a history  that was commuted by war. And I value my life with most of all and a higher being does not bother me of just a shoulder shrug. HBO brain games since I was a kid. Was not a topic but today‚Äôs question. The brain doctors were part of my sympathetic life in hope of my pathetic being. I may feel a bit strange, but walking out from the light felt like a dead nail. Thanks for the app and please review my review with thumbs out!"
1,Taj72,"I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was a charge to use the features. After answering most general questions, app then informs you of weekly/monthly/annual charge or offers you a free 3 day trial that will auto renew if you don‚Äôt cancel. Because I hate those traps and can never easily find the cancelation I‚Äôve is started, I selected to quit the app and not sign up at all. Instead, the app continued and took me to the screen as though I‚Äôd accepted the free trial.  I immediately left the app and went to my subscriptions through Apple to try to cancel any subscription that it implemented without my consent. However, it didn‚Äôt show up in my subscriptions, but it did remain showing in my account as ‚Äúfree.‚Äù I have now wasted 30 minutes trying to figure this out. Ultimately, I deleted the app from my phone. Hopefully, that is sufficient to keep it off my subscription and account. I don‚Äôt know exactly what happened, but save yourself! If you don‚Äôt want to pay $6.99 a week for this app, don‚Äôt even open it!!! It‚Äôs a trap!!!"
5,Asha_88,"I‚Äôm New to this App, but so far I truly enjoy it!!! I‚Äôve been searching for an app that could rate my IQ & this is definitely the best app for that! Not only does it rate your IQ, it also helps train your brain. The games have levels, So you actually start out on an easy level & of course if you complete it with No problem it goes to the next level which is of course, more difficult. The only down side so far is the fact that you have to pay ($6.99) which isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôll be absolutely worth it when you‚Äôre literally getting smarter by using the App. I‚Äôm not sure how the (Free) version works, because I done the Free Trial, but I‚Äôll definitely do an UPDATE REVIEW at the end of my trial & give my Opinion of Everything. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing how much this App can ‚ÄúTrain This üß† of Mine‚Äù!!!"
5,Kanderson39,"I work nights at a factory. My time to do stuff is limited between work and spending time at home. I‚Äôve found that other apps like this tend to hardly work or feel to bland. These guys have found a way to make it feel fun and challenging while working with your schedule. It feels more convenient and easy to just pick up work on your daily tasks. The best part is that you can do so much more than just play cool little games. There are the games, puzzles, and tests that they offer and let you play on your own time and pace. It shows your growth in the different areas of your mind, and while also showing you where you scale in the group of people your age. I went ahead and bought the life time deal. It‚Äôs surprisingly a affordable and fun way to train your mind and work on where you lack."
5,purehoetry,"I was hesitant to try because some ‚Äúbrain teaser‚Äù apps I don‚Äôt find useful enough for the price, but this one is well worth it. One of the only few educational apps I would put my money into. It is free to try, but to unlock access to all of the content does require a subscription of $7 weekly. However, you will find that these games are addicting, helpful, and aesthetically pleasing. They give you a very calming mindset and are lots of fun. I could play them for hours. I have noticed a great change in my day to day life since I started playing it daily. My awareness is sharper now. I find coming up with words in conversation is much easier than before. I am able to remember certain tasks and responsibilities that I would otherwise have trouble recalling. Such a wonderful app! Keep improving."
5,CougClaws,"A few years ago I bled out. Shouldn‚Äôt be here. My brain showed little activity. My speech was a mess. Short term memory gone. Processing speed was horrible. Critical thinking skills lacked. Staying on task impossible. The Aphasia program was awesome, but dropped working with adults during the pandemic.   This App is pushing my brain in ways the Aphasia program used to. I‚Äôm an athletic person and am used to working up a sweat from physical activity‚Ä¶well this App can make me sweat. That‚Äôs how hard it‚Äôs making me work. It‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm scoring up 99% on tasks in comparison to other users. Considering what I‚Äôm recovering from - That. Is. Awesome!!!   Exercising the brain will provide improvements and give results beyond what the experts say is possible. All you have to do is work your brain off and anything is possible. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
1,worst one-sided game,"Why would the app make you fast forward or attempt to exit an ad 3 times? Every time?  Because you care more about ad revenue and sacrifice customers happiness for the bottom line dollar.  It takes away anything slightly good this app had by switching over to the App Store cuz the tiny fast forward doesn‚Äôt actually exit the ad.  Only open a new page to fast forward that one? Which opens the App Store. And if you close it down, that does nothing but restart the countdown to wait more time to exit the ad for the 3rd time.  So you can go back to the menu to play another worthless game for 20 seconds.  It‚Äôs garbage, you don‚Äôt care.  You don‚Äôt care about my review. You don‚Äôt care about anything more than blood money from advertisements for more garbage games that do the exact same thing.  App Store will be better when Apple cleans out the trash.  Brain games.  Sure me knowing 5x3=15 really fast makes me higher than 99% of people my age.  Sure it does.  Ur ratings aren‚Äôt even legit.  Sure my IQ is 136.  I‚Äôm dumb just like this app."
5,#LovesToDance,"I absolutely LOVE this app! For a long time, I‚Äôve wanted an app with multiple bite sized brain challenges or puzzles to be able to solve. This app gave me just that! I love the Workout section (or at least the free workout so far), and although I haven‚Äôt had this app for long, I can definitely see myself using it for a while. I haven‚Äôt bought any of the subscriptions, but I still feel like I‚Äôm getting a lot out of this app. So, if you can‚Äôt afford the subscriptions but you still want an app like this, this is a great choice. I can understand that some people might get frustrated and or annoyed about the amount of ads, but compared to a lot of other games I think the amount of ads is worth it. Overall, I personally love this app and I would definitely recommend!"
3,Sutten M,"Frankly, this app is great for what it is. The games are fun, and the tracking is great. However, I was misled when I purchased a life time copy of this game. Perhaps I mis understood the nature of the sale, but this is a subscription service HOWEVER you can also purchase life time access to this app by paying a lump sum fee up front. I chose to do that during a sale they were having specifically for that deal. This was a few months ago.  After purchasing that life time access, I was STILL charged monthly for the subscription. I feel like I was mis led. Not accusing anyone of saying that it is a scam, but these guys 100% need to work on their wording when they say ‚Äúlife time access after paying this‚Äù but not explaining that you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee. To that end, buyer beware.   3 stars cause the actual content is great. -2 stars because the way they process their transactions are mis-leading at best."
5,Unhappy User#X,"I have noticed my mental decline over the years and felt unsatisfied, so one day I realized I wanted to take action on it and do things to help me keep my mind sharp. That‚Äôs when I found Impulse and decided to give it a shot.   Ultimately, the results speak for themselves. I‚Äôve been slowly making progress and I‚Äôm able to play certain games at a speed and precision I didn‚Äôt even realize I was capable. I cannot speak as to how well using Impulse has actually benefited me, but my mind feels sharp and I continue to get better by the day.   In terms of features I‚Äôd like to see in the future, I think there‚Äôs potential to include more gamification concepts such as streak freezes, leadership boards, and learning material to learn what could I do outside the app to keep working on keeping my brain sharp."
5,pureboi92,"I‚Äôve been using the app for a couple weeks and really enjoy it. The games are pretty unique and helped me understand what skills I‚Äôm good at and which ones I need to train more. I like that the ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù section shows you the average score for each category and specific game. I think it would definitely be nice to see the average score based on training skill too. For example, I noticed that my ‚ÄúSelective Attention‚Äù was high based on the high scores I got in a few games. I also noticed my ‚ÄúWorking Memory‚Äù wasn‚Äôt as high based on some lower scoring games. I think it would definitely help seeing that in the ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù section so we can keep in mind what we need to work on. Maybe even some links to research articles or something for each training skill would be useful too"
5,Jessicaelise12345,"Love it! I bought this app for a healthy alternative to my nightly doom scrolling habit on social media with all those targeted ads that don‚Äôt add value to my life/only make me feel like I need to buy things. I‚Äôm on an 84 day streak on Impulse and my skill progress has increased substantially. So many great puzzles to choose from and they all get increasingly more challenging so I don‚Äôt get bored like other repetitive and pointless app games. My social media time has cut down significantly and I feel great exercising my brain instead. Also, Instead of opening my social apps when I first wake up, I play a few quick puzzles on Impulse and it helps me wake up and energize my mind through puzzle solving and has reduced my procrastination anxiety in the mornings before my work day or exercise routine. Highly recommend."
5,HS technologist,"This game popped up when I was looking for word games. Then I discovered it was a brain-challenging game for various brain functions, some of which I felt were declining since COVID and aging. I found my strengths and weaknesses while having so much fun. I played for at least 4 or 5 hours the first day (though I had some obligations to finish). I ended up buying the year (for now) and set up my randomized daily challenges reminder. With each game, I have improved and learned ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù to get the right answers as well as completing them faster through practice. There are also other interesting ‚Äútests‚Äù that may give some insight to other brain concerns, like stress leveling and IQ, among others. Definitely worth the price. Looking forward to my daily challenges from Impulse and improving my brain plasticity!"
5,CharlieMahealani,"My entire life I have been considered a quite intelligent person by many standards but after experiencing a brain injury, memory loss due to ptsd and other mental health struggles and the general brain fog of motherhood twice over I often feel underwhelmed by my cognitive ability. I‚Äôm always subconsciously on the lookout for any way I can try to recover what I‚Äôve lost. On a whim I downloaded the app with no expectations, unsure if I would want to go beyond the three day trial. After just the first day, I knew I was going to be investing in a subscription. The games are actually fun (hubby thinks so too) and the assessment aspect makes it easy for me to get a bit competitive. There are insightful quizzes and helpful ‚Äúbrain workout‚Äù plans. I‚Äôm not sure if this will have any long term, measurable effects but I‚Äôm not disappointed at all!"
2,Will184858293,"If I recall I signed up with a trial. Very shady to have such a high price and list it weekly. There are some beneficial games but not worth it in my opinion. There are dozens of plan options but really I was surprised that I was subscribed on this plan, I don‚Äôt really remember doing it and I never would have intentionally signed up for something with such a high weekly price. If you get this app just make sure to really figure out how much you‚Äôre paying, what you get, and how often.  Also, for that price I still have to watch lengthy ads in between each round? I don‚Äôt understand how this app has such high reviews when there are plenty of other apps with similar or better games for an exponentially cheaper price or free, and this is the first one I have come across that charges you weekly.   To the developers, please don‚Äôt bother responding unless you significantly decrease your pricing to something reasonable, and fix this ad scheme."
5,NoahMGry,"I can‚Äôt attest to the legitimacy of the IQ test or to the accuracy of the metrics that are supposedly being improved but I can speak on the entertainment value. It is very fun being able to play these logic puzzles daily and there is a clear polished feel to it all which for some might justify a subscription to the premium. To be clear: this product is technically free and you are given a good amount of games/tests but you also have the option of paying for the premium service with which you can become as smart as Einstein probably. Overall, perhaps I am a skeptic but I believe the primary way we should view this is as an entertaining app where you can complete daily logic puzzles and not as brain food. Great app though so it gets a 5* review from me."
3,üëäBRO FISTüëä,"I never expect too much from apps like this these days because many of them promise things they don‚Äôt deliver on. $6.99 a week in my opinion is also asking too much when there are a lot of free (or at least inexpensive) online services that provide similar personality, IQ, ADHD and many more tests. At the very least, you should be allowed to explore all of the features of the app in the free trial (which is only 3 days). How else am I supposed to decide if I enjoy the app enough to pay for it? The free trial allows you to take tests and do puzzles, but withholds the results unless you purchase the full plan. All in all, if you have the money to spend and/or want the convenience of everything in one place, this app could be for you. But for someone who is genuinely interested in learning about more about myself and how my brain works, I‚Äôll be looking for other options."
5,Great for the brain,"This far(on a free version) I find this well structured, each game tells you what part of the skill you are working on, which is so valuable . Knowing and reading what part this does is actually reiteration for the brain to do just that . I do wish yall would create an image of the brain and highlight what area it‚Äôs working and the games you create should also be linked to various aspects of the brain so ppl have a better idea on what area they are strong in vs need improvements in. If there is a way to add a colored version of the brain showing which game targets what and naming that part of the brain, this will enhance your app.  Well done, it‚Äôs fun but also a great way to exercise your brain during any breaks you take ‚Ä¶ be it from work or studying‚Ä¶"
1,Moonlighting86,"I signed up for the three day free trial, read the terms that you need to cancel 24 hours before the trial ends, and then found there was nowhere within the app or the App Store where I could cancel.  I contacted Apple support as the developers have suggested in previous negative reviews - Apple says they have no record of a subscription and therefore cannot cancel it. This makes me think that I will be charged once my trial has ended and the developers are running some kind of scam.  I have never seen an app where there is no ability to cancel before your trial ends.  I have emailed the company as well, but I‚Äôm not expecting that they will get back to me.  If this charge goes through I will be contacting my credit card company to fight the charge.  This is ridiculous.  I spent an hour chatting with Apple and they‚Äôve had to escalate it to a phone call because they couldn‚Äôt help me.  How can this company tell you to go to Apple to cancel your trial, but Apple has no record it of?"
5,Cyrusun,"Fun and lots of games that keep my brain a little sharper. I liked the IQ test, it was pretty fun and challenging. The personality test was okay but I didn‚Äôt really like the fact that it made you choose between only two options per question when some of the words or concepts are definitely situationally more complex than to just choose between the two extremes.. but I get the point and of course as it says it isn‚Äôt an administered test so I didn‚Äôt take it too seriously. But the games are great and I feel like they help get me in a sharp mood.. if you get an offer to buy the yearly package for like 16 bucks, it seems like a good deal considering a lot of the games might have their own app with advertisements and you of course get more than that with this app.."
5,whomahwhatsit,"I don‚Äôt play many Mobile games, but I like this one, just a few minutes of game play to train the brain, simple math problems part is I think a really good one to help keep you sharp especially if you have a job that constantly has you doing math problems like dealing with money or measurements. Another one I thought I‚Äôd be better at is the arrow game, I was mistaken üòÖ swipe the direction of the white arrow, no problem, swipe the opposite direction for the yellow arrows, no problem super easy, let‚Äôs just say I was a little overly confident especially when you start to speed up. Typical watch ads to play for free. Subscription for no ads or one time purchase. I‚Äôm probably gonna one time purchase once I get tired of dealing with the ads."
5,dont fall for the adds,"So I got this app a couple days ago and I really love it! A month ago I had made it my mission to make get stronger mentally, I did some research and found out that learning a new language is great for your mental health so I decided to download a app (Doulingo) that could help me learn Russian. About a month in I realized that when I started a language lesson in the morning my head was just not ready. So I got this app to, I use this app before my language app in the mornings and it‚Äôs working wonders!!! I am learning Russian so much more easier and faster then I was before and this app helped me a lot! So thanks developers!!!!!!! And if you are considering getting this app then I suggest you do, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt just to try it out for a day!"
5,Wordyme,"I had Covid multiple times and the brain fog was seriously debilitating. I was forgetful, unfocused and lacked acuity in ways that were unsettling. I began using the impulse app as a tool and initially it was challenging. I enjoyed that I was only achieving for myself, no competition with others. I‚Äôve been using it for almost two years now and I feel like I‚Äôve regained my brain back. I even fine tuned some math skills that maybe weren‚Äôt as sharp even before Covid. I love this App! There are games for every interest and I even play them when I cannot sleep and they are actually relaxing. I have recommended this app to my aging parents, my peers and friends of all ages simply because it‚Äôs become such an asset for me. I hope you enjoy it!"
1,npursell,"I was extremely interested in this app based on the reviews. However, I was also extremely disappointed. I wanted to try the trial version before committing to purchase. I didn‚Äôt make it past three days before I was fed up with it. For the free trial app, you have to watch an ad before each game. That is understandable and I have no problem with that. However, when you click the ‚Äúwatch ad‚Äù button, the app just brings up a spinning load icon without going to the ad. It will do this three or four times before actually taking you to an ad. More than once, I had to just completely close the app and start again. It did the same thing. It is almost like they are trying to make it so annoying they force you to purchase the upgrade. They have definitely lost a customer here. Before you ask, no I do not have WiFi or service issues. Every single other app on my phone works flawlessly and without interruption. This is definitely on Impulse‚Äôs end and it is very sad."
5,Vicki 3835,"With the many different test I have learned a lot about myself already. Things are spelled out, they are very easy to understand and you‚Äôre like‚Ä¶wow that‚Äôs right on the money but I didn‚Äôt realize this or this. There are suggestions on how to improve your mood, communication with others, your life in so many ways. It‚Äôs just amazing. And as we age we need brain games to help keep us motivated & moving forward at a great & steady pace, this app does that. The game‚Äôs challenges you in all areas of your brain & helps you to push yourself further all while telling you how you performed against your peers. I suggest this app to everyone. It is really, really worth your time & a great investment in yourself!!"
2,courtney<33,"Engaging and fun app but pay attention to which subscription you‚Äôre paying! You may pay anywhere from $9.99/week ($520/year!) to $9.99/month ($120/year) to $40/year for the exact same ImpulsePRO plan. I understand there is a difference in price with time commitment but that‚Äôs crazy. Also, when I went to manage my subscription in iPhone settings, I saw about 20 versions of the same package all with crazy price differences from $4.99 to $9.99 per week and I could pick whichever I wanted from that screen. Hope the team reads this and cleans up their public facing price book and also considers being more transparent with their customers about setting the right price for the value of the product, instead of hoping their users will pay $9.99/week if they don‚Äôt take the time to dig into the fact that they could pay $4.99 just by canceling and renewing."
5,mika 273878,"I struggle with forgetting things a lot due to having fibromyalgia and something that comes with that is forgetfulness and concentration.  I downloaded this app because it was starting to become embarrassing how much I would lose things and just simply forget little tedious details to my daily life. Although, since I have been using impulse I‚Äôve actually noticed a huge improvement, and the people around me have also. I‚Äôm only 24 years old so this is a big deal for being my age. Also, this isn‚Äôt one of those reviews to get some extra ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù like other apps do, I legitimately have noticed this app helping me. So if your reading this review, I would definitely download it."
5,AmyNAlabama,"I love love love these brain teasing games so much it‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôm actually strengthening my brain at the same time!!! This app loaded full of helpful but FUN games that help strengthen your memory, focus, problem solving tactics, etc and that‚Äôs just to name a few.. but there‚Äôs so much more to these exciting impulse games and you will not regret giving it a try bc I promise you will not want to stop after your personalized test / games are active.  Even allows you to get notifications in case you forget which this app will help with everyday‚Ä¶  i promise you will never believe your actually helping your brain while having fun!!!  What have you got to lose??? Oh yeah.. your mind! ü§Ø"
1,Bombdelicious,"Oh, I like this what I got to do with it except they tricked me into thinking I was going to get a three day trial. Which I signed up for because I didn‚Äôt have the money in my account to subscribe yet as I was playing, they offered me a discount of 92% off for a year by subscribing and it‚Äôs starting today which I wanted the 90% off for the year but I didn‚Äôt have the money in my account today so now my game has stopped on me and I‚Äôm not getting the three day trial. Like I was supposed to get because I was tricked into believing I would get it. Buy an offer you couldn‚Äôt refuse. They try to trick your brain. Lol but not funny so so much for this game I will be deleting it! Well I realized they gave me the game but the whole time I had no idea til now and it‚Äôs over may 18th so I missed the whole time I could of been using the  app so I like it so far but I only have it for 18 more days and I just started playing it what a bummer! It‚Äôs seems like a great app"
5,AOT_TYTY,I‚Äôve only used the app for a couple hours now and the way it challenges your brain is superb and it only gets more challenging the better you get while still being enjoyable. In this modern day and age where people have become so distracted and can‚Äôt focus on anything that does stimulate pleasure and enjoyment for more than a few seconds before they swipe up to the next reel this app is really a good refresher. I purchased the one time payment because I‚Äôm my opinion I believe it‚Äôs completely worth it and training my mind in this modern age will help me and everyone else who also made the purchase have an advantage in todays society. Highly recommend this app and I‚Äôll be using it everyday!!!!!
5,Nyxphoenix,"Been playing for two days and so far I really enjoy the exercises . I love puzzles and games that challenge my wit and strategy . Helps to unwind and relax my mind or stimulate and inspire in a positive and beneficial way. It has features also to tailor to the intensity of what you are going for mood wise . I don‚Äôt like games that unnecessary stress me out , but I do appreciate a challenge that motivates my focus and observation as well as creativity. It serves it purpose, so far so good . I recommend it. I enjoy finding patterns, connections and visual /spatial aspects as well as language and reading comprehension. Looking forward to the math exercises since I know I could really use the practice and encouragement to strengthen those skills."
5,AnitaMinet,"Who do I call or speak to about an unintentional charge? Before canceling my subscription today, ‚ÄúRestore Purchases‚Äù was pressed and I received a pop up saying I purchased the lifetime upgrade, which I don‚Äôt want at all! I made sure to go into the App Store to cancel the subscription immediately after. I want to make sure I wasn‚Äôt charged almost $40 for a game!  That being said, I enjoyed playing this game. As I‚Äôve grown, so has technology, so anything before high-tech computers and phones seems primitive. I can honestly say I still enjoy reading paper back books, but any old techniques for challenging my brain are so outdated now. Good game filled with good puzzles. If I could afford it, I‚Äôd love it even more."
5,sbfumfrlpdidjd,I am so happy the developer responses to our comments for good and bad feedback! THAT IS A DEVELOPER that is serious and CARES!!!! I wrote a review Friday with the same title and got a response today not even a week later!!!! That‚Äôs truly amazing! I am so so happy I subscribed to this game yearly!!! Between elevate and impulse (impulse has way more options than Elevate) not gonna lie I play both of these everyday I spend more time on impulse than just the daily training! I absolutely love this and for the developer to give us an email for any suggestions changes etc THAT IS A COMPANY THAT CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! So I can only imagine their care for their employees as well i am so PROUD to be a member of this brain training!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!
5,allibraswell,"i haven‚Äôt played a game on an app since candy crush came out, but when i discovered this when scrolling on the app store out of curiosity i was intrigued. i‚Äôm 26 with an average intelligence (in my personal opinion anyway). after a 1.5 year hypomanic episode ended due to developing mono from overworking/burnout, a year long depression followed. ive always been spacey but it worsened tremendously to the point i couldn‚Äôt develop coherent sentences when my health crashed. additionally, it‚Äôs hard to keep my attention and interest with pretty much anything, but this game has captured both. it‚Äôs validated i still have potential and my brain isn‚Äôt complete mush forever. ive always been insecure about my intelligence and brain functionality, but i thoroughly enjoy playing these games because they make me feel intelligent while being challenged. i also refuse to pay for apps except for a music subscription but this is another exception to the rule. i highly recommend this app and the subscription! it has helped my confidence grow, my brain elevate, and gives me hope for my future self‚Äôs mental state!"
5,Jodi5868,"The games are quick and hold my interest. My short term memory issketchy. I frequently forget where I left my glasses. I‚Äôll go to get something from a room and  get distracted by something and forget to grab it when I leave the room.  So, the app allows you to choose how long you‚Äôd like to play.  I like puzzles so I find the games and the 5 or 10 minute sessions relaxing and engaging.    I just started playing and will edit my review if I find that it‚Äôs working for me.  I chose the trial membership.  I appreciate apps that allow you to try before subscribing. I am willing to pay for something if it works.  Very annoying to pay for an app that doesn‚Äôt live up to expectations."
5,dan the arborist,"I‚Äôve been living with anxiety and depression since I was 18 (mid 50‚Äôs now), and recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I‚Äôve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.    The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.  The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I‚Äôm fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.    Highly recommend the app, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing increased results as I progress."
5,WhiteBoyCarl69,"Since March of last year I was extremely depressed and lost in what I was doing with my life, I‚Äôve tried other therapy methods and apps but none prevailed and when I first saw Impulse being advertised I didn‚Äôt believe it (mainly on how they delivered the pitch) at first but I downloaded it.. took a couple test and every single test made sense and was 100% accurate and honestly.. I feel happier.. better.. I feel like I have energy again and I no longer have to force a smile.. I ask myself what would‚Äôve happened if I never found the help in this app.. I can tell you it wouldn‚Äôt be anything so right now I‚Äôm just thankful to have a self checkup everyday to make sure I‚Äôm ok"
1,üåª‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®,"I have a few things to say... I downloaded this app as I wanted to excessive my brain and knowledge, keep in mind I am still a minor so I use a family account... This scammed me and my family, as even if you delete the app it still charges you until you remove it from your subscription (I deleted it before the trial ended)  we did not realize till a month after! So now even after we removed it it still wants us to make the final purchase, this money could have gone to so much better, it could have gone to family time or donations but instead it goes to scammers like them! There is a rainforest burning and and kids dying of hunger...and instead of people who are privileged to even own a phone shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for something as useless as dumb brain activity...that you could probably do online for free! If I could rate this app I seriously would and I despise talking about things this way but I honestly hate this app! If I could give it a 0 I would..."
1,SkyRay93,"Signed up for 3 day free trial ‚Äúunlimited pro membership‚Äù, after which app costs $7 a week to use.  Launched the app, immediately got a pop up giving me a ‚Äúone-time offer only available on this screen 92% off for the year!‚Äù for a $29/year membership, which would cancel out my free trial period. Wanting to get the opportunity to try the app first, I declined.  Went to take my first test, the advertised ‚Äúchildhood trauma‚Äù test on TikTok.   First, I want to note it was not the test advertised. On TikTok it‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúinterpret the picture‚Äù tests, in reality it is a ‚Äúselect from most likely to least likely on each of 40 questions‚Äù.   Second, when I got to the end of the 40 question test, I was not allowed to view my results without first paying $7 to start my weekly subscription now or $29 for the year - despite the fact that I was supposed to have an unlimited pro free trial, and the $29 was supposed to be some super deal that was only available once.  In short - they‚Äôre playing you with fake discounts and hiding behind the facade of a free trial just to throw pop ups and pay walls in your face. Anything they can do to work some money out of you. Deleted the app and canceled my trial less than 30 minutes after downloading and came straight here to write this review to warn others."
5,northside ella,"This app is awesome to help keep you on top of things. Some people and up laying back watching videos all day and that doesn‚Äôt work your brain. I actually had to think in these Little games, I had to do math, I actually had to remember where things were in place, and I had to match items that. It may seem like and the games are games that we played when we were younger, but in all actuality when we were younger they were meant to help stimulate our brain and make it work at a point to. So if you think you‚Äôre slipping a little bit maybe forgetting too much or things to start coming to you fast enough give it a try and see if it works for you it‚Äôs working for me"
4,Skim8,"It‚Äôs good for what it is. I paid $15 for a 1 year subscription because the ads were non-stop. I enjoy most of the games/puzzles, but there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement.   Once you move up a level in any puzzle, you can‚Äôt play the lower level anymore. When you get to level 10, you can‚Äôt do much more with it and it becomes boring. Some of my favorite games are impossible for me on level 10, so now I can‚Äôt really play them at all.   I wish they would add new puzzles. I‚Äôve canceled my subscription, so it won‚Äôt renew, but I would have kept it if they made just a few simple changes. When you look at what you actually get for the price, it wasn‚Äôt worth it for me. There are better options available for the price."
5,THENETKA,"At first I was skeptical when I saw this Ad on Instagram but I told myself ‚Äúwhat do I got to lose? Just a little bit of space.‚Äù And ever since that moment I‚Äôve been having a blast and keeping up with my streaks.   The games aren‚Äôt that difficult when you first start and very easy to pick up, there‚Äôs also creative games you can play aside from the 3 brain training games a day.  There is a subscription you can acquire to unlock more features for the app but I can‚Äôt lie, the free version is just as good as the paid! I do see myself acquiring a subscription in the future! Looking for something to keep that brain active in a world of mush definitely give impulse a go!"
5,magillicus,"I‚Äôve only had it for 2-3 days, but it‚Äôs exactly the type app I was hoping for. I assume, as the app states, the games will continue to increase in difficulty as I progress. Even the initial games have an appropriate difficulty level, though. I also like that I get notifications during the day to play more‚Ä¶which, oddly enough, only seem to show up when I‚Äôm idle. Each game details its focuses before you begin, which the app determines based on the preferences you set when you sign up. I generally don‚Äôt have large amounts of time to dedicate to entertainment-based apps (outside of fantasy football), but this self-improvement app is one I look forward to opening each morning."
4,Musibird,Great news!!!! So when I first discovered this I seen that you could pay monthly yearly or one time payment I was just going to do the 3 day trial but then the app decided to give me a discount opportunity. I think it was 20% off 50% off or 92% off. It was three gift boxes and they mixed up after showing you what was in it and then you could choose. I was lucky enough to get to 92% off. It‚Äôs yearly tho but it‚Äôs cool!!  I love this app I‚Äôve had it for 2 days but still I love it! I have not ran into any complications so far and that is good! The only issue is I don‚Äôt like the way it compares you to others it‚Äôs ok I guess but for someone who has had trouble with inferior feelings I feel it might discourage them if they were to get a lower percentage
5,yvngvlone,When I play these brain games I focus better than I normally would. I think that stems from the fact that it‚Äôs right on my phone. Normally I would find my self anxiously checking my phone throughout the day not really focusing on anything for too long. But now whenever I feel bored or restless I‚Äôll open up the Impulse app and I‚Äôm able to just tune in and get some good metal workouts going while having the comfort of being right on my phone. Because let‚Äôs face it. Our phones are an extension of who we are now. So being able to use our phones to strengthen our brain is honestly the biggest benefit of this app. I‚Äôm no longer scrolling endlessly. Restlessly. Relentlessly.
5,novaliseeeeeeeeezzzzzzcedezzzz,"It‚Äôs a nice game it definitely keeps your mind sharp and tests your focus the only downfall is they try to sell every little level up and continue to after you decline. I mean after it‚Äôs declined it should not be pushed on you the way it is. once in a while cool but it‚Äôs too frequent. A lot of games have it where you can play without purchase and make in app purchases if you choose. Again this one has that but it seems it‚Äôs there just to pressure you to buying more. Over all what it‚Äôs intended for is good fun and a challenging game, WITHOUT the purchases!! So five star for its design and reason for design but 3-4 stars for profit intentions and aggravation from pressing the issue  honestly‚Ä¶."
1,AngelaAretz,"The games are fun and the app is well-made but after my trial version expired, I discovered that I‚Äôm paying 8 dollars PER WEEK (and that‚Äôs with a 30% discount) and there is no easy way to end your subscription on the iPhone application. The company makes it all too easy to sign up and intentionally difficult to cancel your subscription. In the meantime, you‚Äôre paying 28 bucks a month‚Äî which if you keep it, ends up being almost 340 dollars per year! I‚Äôve used many brain trainings apps and none were even close to being this outrageously expensive! Even intensely involved video games (with very advanced graphics and complicated storylines) don‚Äôt cost even a tenth of this to own for life! I‚Äôm truly appalled at how much they‚Äôre charging and disgusted by their use of ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù to lure people into paying an exorbitant amount for something that isn‚Äôt even worth a fraction of what they charge.   Would NOT recommend, unless you have disposable income."
1,queenprey,So first off I had totally forgot I had this app in 2022 and I did the free trial period. I recently downloaded it again and it gave me the option to do the free trial so that‚Äôs what I did. I always make sure to cancel before it has me fully subscribe just incase I‚Äôm no longer interested in the app. I noticed that I couldn‚Äôt download anything because there was an unpaid amount on my account which happened to be from impulse. Impulse never notified me that they were going to charge me the full amount instead of giving me the free trial. (It allowed me to select free trial when I downloaded the app) so that really threw me off when I see a charge I wasn‚Äôt expected considering it was only suppose to be a free trial‚Ä¶ now I can‚Äôt download anything until the charge is paid which I think is unfair to me as a customer because impulse should have communicated that with me from the start.
5,SE√òN,So earlier today I was going through a deep in look inside my head and drowning in my own thoughts just scrolling through and came upon this app..now seeing things on TikTok I usually brush it off but I‚Äôll say giving this app a try and a chance in a desperate point walker I‚Äôve got to say from the moment using this app in the short span ..it‚Äôs made me feel happier with its nice sounds it has for you winning to the bubbly noises of clicking other items ..the whole theme is very comforting and maybe could be a bit more if given the opportunity of it it could be something so much more ..please give this app a try you won‚Äôt regret it ‚ù§Ô∏è
3,Mayor MacDonough,"It‚Äôs not the most engaging, but it certainly does keep mental acuity sharp as promised. It‚Äôs greatly lacking in diversity among minigames however, and its quizzes and tests are spotty at best. Even still, I would recommend this for someone who wants to casually remind themselves about basic math or problem solving skills, or for educating younger audiences about simple mental tasks. The app becomes less useful for adults who wish to use it as a learning tool though, and its effect at preserving more complex mental abilities appears to be limited by the low minigame diversity. All in all, excellent tool for younger audiences and anyone struggling with maintaining their basic mental capabilities, but an adult looking to develop new skills would find better success searching for alternative resources."
5,Awesome Game!!! :D :D,"My father got me the app, Impulse to train my brain. At first, I was pretty confused why he gave us that app. I‚Äôve been playing it since though and it really my brain out. I loved the app! The way things were designed, the challenges, the brain-twisting, the fun‚Ä¶ I loved it.   Now, I am a Middle School beginner and I forgot about the game six months ago and randomly stopped playing it. I saw my brother playing it and I asked why he‚Äôs on his phone. He told me he‚Äôs plying Impulse so I remembered‚Ä¶ and I downloaded the game on my phone. It got better from six or ten months ago! Especially how challenging things are. I think the creators and developers have done an awesome job on this game!"
5,Nikki (NeNe),"The reason I like impulse training is because it makes you think quick on your feet, makes your heart beat faster because it makes you get excited because your racing against the clock and trying to beat it without missing any. It‚Äôs also exciting because you want to be quick and get it right and as quick as you can but you don‚Äôt know if you can. So it‚Äôs like your trying to prove to yourself you can do it and at the same time not let yourself down. Then when you do beat the clock and you score good on each game; at the end your happy and it was satisfying!! Like a pat on your back to yourself, good job so to speak!"
2,xenotashin,"So, I mostly enjoyed my time with Impulse these last 38 days. However, because the information locked behind the premium version is your actual progress, you‚Äôre stuck seeing ‚Äòcomparison‚Äô ratings. This might be fine, but it feels awful when because you miss 1 ghost on the memory ghost game, even due to a misstap, it‚Äôll say you ‚ÄúYou did better than 0% of players, don‚Äôt feel bad this level is hard.‚Äù. Which not only comes off as condescending, but unfortunately apparently is something to feel bad about because apparently I did worse than literally everyone because I accidentally tapped one tile to the right.  I know, it‚Äôs a silly thing to gripe about, but that combined with how the game actively punishes you for last second guessing is just not fun. I hope it improves, but for now I‚Äôm done."
5,AppEdd10,"When getting an app that you hope will improve your quality of life and help you spend better time on your phone you want it to last without having to pay several dollars a month. This lifetime subscription is affordable and comes with everything I wanted and more. I wanted challenging and fun games. This app has that. I wanted daily notifications and a streak counter to hold me accountable. This app has that. The added bonus of self-improvement resources, IQ tests, and personality tests was something I didn‚Äôt know I wanted but you guessed it‚Ä¶ this app has it. Love the app, keep improving it and adding more challenge, you‚Äôve got a happy customer here. ü§ôüèΩ"
1,IsaacH320,"So basically this is a $50 dollar app, you made a weekly subscription $7 and a yearly subscription $29, it‚Äôd be a waste to get either subscription and you know that is how people will think of it, predatory at best. If you choose to use it for free you‚Äôre going to be watching ads for roughly 35-50 percent of the time you‚Äôll be using the app, in some scenarios I would finish a game and have to watch an ad that lasted longer then the match did and that would happen back to back sometimes. If this app was a straight $10 (that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs worth let‚Äôs be real) I would have bought it. It‚Äôs a shame you guys chose these predatory marketing practices because the app is actually not bad otherwise but it surely isn‚Äôt worth $7 a week, $29 a year or $50 for a lifetime purchase. Also the app keeps freezing at the end of ads, I have to close the app and then watch another ad."
5,isa 8749,"My intentions when I first downloaded this app were to have something to do when I was bored, but something ""worthwhile."" Even though playing something on my phone isn't the best thing, I actually found myself being challenged mentally with this app. The games are in multiple categories, such as math, language, memory training, etc. Each game is unique and entertaining, while at the same time it really is training your brain. Throughout my time of using it, I've seen  improvement in simple everyday reflexes, or paying attention to what happens in my peripheral, as well as better memory."
3,JadeMurrSir,"I downloaded this app as a replacement for the mind numbing games filled with ads I was spending my free time playing, but now I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs much better. The games are engaging yes, however there is an ad before and after almost every game you play. I understand ads being in the app, but between every single game? It almost makes me not want to use it at all. I understand part of it is an incentive to get the subscription- but y‚Äôall I‚Äôm a broke college student, I don‚Äôt just get subscriptions casually (regardless of how cheap they are). Besides this the games are fun, they‚Äôre entertaining while also providing a little more brain work with each level. I‚Äôll see how I like it as time goes on, but for right now the ads are kind of ruining it for me."
1,everynicknameistaken369,You can‚Äôt access anything except the questionnaire on your personal demographics and interests. Right after that the app offers a free trial of three days with an auto subscription after that you must cancel 24 hours in advance.  I tried to click out of that and the app enrolled me instead. I tried a quiz just to see and I couldn‚Äôt even view my results without paying with either a subscription or one time fee. At one point a screen popped up and forced me to selected an prize offer. I couldn‚Äôt click out of the pop up until I did. Then it tried to charge me for a full year subscription with this ‚Äúfree offer‚Äù.  Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to cancel it and I have to go through the Apple ID settings but can‚Äôt find the selections that the app‚Äôs instructions gave me in my Apple ID profile.  Also had to really dig for those instructions.  This app is a scam.
5,Wbzine,"Engaging with a mind training application has proven instrumental in refining and augmenting my cognitive prowess. Through its meticulously designed exercises and tailored challenges, this app has become an indispensable tool in enhancing my mental acuity, bolstering my memory retention, and fostering sharper focus. The structured regimen provided by the app has not only optimized my problem-solving abilities but has also imbued me with a heightened sense of mindfulness, enabling me to approach tasks with greater clarity and efficacy. Furthermore, the app's adaptability to my individual progress ensures a dynamic and personalized learning experience, ultimately culminating in a discernible enhancement of my overall brain function."
5,AshBash325,"Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in my family on my maternal side and I‚Äôve found that as I age and near 40, regularly spending dedicated time working my brain muscles on activities unrelated to my personal life and/or work are what keep me feeling mentally strong and reduces the fear of developing dementia later.   Of course, there are also many benefits now, years before I have to be actively concerned about brain degeneration‚Äîimproved attention span, quicker processing, better memory. Impulse is great for those times you‚Äôd otherwise be mindlessly scrolling social media; the games are fun and the advantages are many. Highly recommended for those wanting to optimize their brain health!"
3,Angelface162891,"I‚Äôve been using it in my downtime rather than getting stuck in a scroll hole on ig. I‚Äôve seen lots of improvement and It‚Äôs really fun! However, recently I was in the middle of playing one of their mini games and I was notified that my account that I paid a year for had been deleted on another device. I do not own nor have I logged in on another device. All of my account history over the previous 3-4 months was deleted. I‚Äôm very confused and sad by this situation. I had taken almost all of the test and was making progress in all the games. I was enjoying seeing my improvement over the months. I‚Äôm hoping I can find a way to restore my account data but I‚Äôm having trouble finding a help line for the app. Very demotivating. :("
1,Bee Truthful,"Knowing that nobody reads the small print, they can‚Äôt stand behind their product enough to legitimately give a free trial period. You must decide at least 24 hours before your trial period expires to keep it free. If you decide and cancel on your third day they will charge you for whatever time period they have automatically set up. Everything is difficult to find. A trial period is supposed to be just that. If you only have 2 days to try and decide it is purposely misleading to call it a 3 day free trial. They knew this when they purposely set those rules so they could steal money from everyone willing to give them a try, but still try to legally protect themselves. Absolutely disgusting individuals! It‚Äôs not much money a month, but the principle boils my blood, especially with so many people really hurting financially right now in the extreme inflation of the economy."
5,KimMcDPT,"I downloaded thinking I‚Äôd try it because I‚Äôve been through several free apps with similar brain games. You really can‚Äôt even try it without subscribing. I kept hitting cancel or no payment plan and it kept taking me back to ‚Äúdouble click to subscribe‚Äù on my App Store page‚Ä¶.umm, no. Maybe a purposeful glitch so people get frustrated, can‚Äôt get off that page, and accidentally subscribe just to move on??? I shut down my App Store, deleted the app, and checked my subscriptions to be sure it didn‚Äôt sign itself up for me.  The app looks like it could be fun. But NOT for the price."
3,diimo.,"It's a great brain app that strengthens your mind and can help you feel better. I personally liked it, but the bad thing is that there's so many ads. You can only go three levels on certain games without getting ads, and some only one. The price isn't very high for a year, but I just want to do something for free that helps my life. Putting so many ads in there along with an amazing app changed nothing, it more or less just left it the same. If you're willing to spend a little cash to get no ads and all that, then I would say this is an amazing app that provides you with pretty much everything, but if you don't want to spend it, then you're just gonna have to deal with all the ads and work arounds."
5,Qoebeth,"I love Impulse. I originally downloaded it because I‚Äôm getting older (63) and I felt like my memory and focus were slipping.  Since I started playing the games my scores have gone up in all the categories and I‚Äôve noticed a difference in my ability to remember phone numbers and details at work, as well as a huge uptick in my ability to do math in my head.  The variety of games and puzzles keeps things fresh and the tests are sometimes quite revealing.  Definitely five stars. I do have a paid version, and it‚Äôs been worth every penny already. I‚Äôm trying to get my mom to get an iPhone so she can play too."
1,mandy loves edward cullen,"It‚Äôs just another app that‚Äôs trying to get you to pay for a subscription. It seems like every single app these days is a subscription and I‚Äôm sure the games are really fun and it might help in the long run, but after having to fill out a five minute quiz to find out the only way you can play this game is by paying over $4.99 a month is ridiculous.   If I wanted to buy an app, I would just do that. Seriously, just tell people there‚Äôs a cost upfront. As soon as I found out there was a pay wall I immediately deleted the app. And frankly, I‚Äôm never gonna pay for this app out of spite. I would‚Äôve never downloaded it if I would‚Äôve known that there was a pay wall, and I guess that‚Äôs the point. Overall, it‚Äôs bad business and a bad business practice. If I could vote it 0 out of 5 stars I would. Save your time don‚Äôt download it."
5,HighlightedPencil,"This app is perfect, for a while I‚Äôve been questioning myself and my own iq. I trust this app as if it shows all my results. And makes me feel confident about my education. It‚Äôs super easy and there are so many fun educational games to stretch your head instead of those boring cross word puzzles. I suggest this app especially for ones who are interested into taking iq quizzes or seeing your growth in development.   There‚Äôs also hyped personality quizzes and more that you can learn about yourself to questions.   There are a lot of questions in most but short time. Which is how you know this app is advanced, to conclude download this app.. like now!"
4,X0wolf0X,"I really think this app is great and a good way to understand yourself a bit more but as a child myself and other we can‚Äôt always pays for stuff just to see results, I feel like this is unfair and not a great way for people to want to use the app. I would like to be able to see my results so I know what to work on and what to do more research on, people have made it so you have to pay for everything just to use an app. Most people can‚Äôt afford stuff like that or their parents won‚Äôt let them because of the prices. I understand this is a way to get money from the app but there are better ways to do so."
5,ramoni666,"im 23, i have adhd and i smoke A LOT of marijuana so this app actually helps me a lot. even when im not consistent, i jump right where i left off. when im consistent, its even better bc i can keep a detailed track of my progress and even earn achievements. i bought the year membership the first week of using the app and i have zero regrets. i dont like notifications popping up on my phone so i have them all turned off, however i dont mind when impulse notifications pop up. its a reminder to exercise your brain. my favorite part about the app is the tests you can take to learn more about yourself."
5,Isabelly hofman De Sozua,So cool and I really wanna play a lot of times and I hope this person that made this game do a lot of this versions and it looks so fun to play but it looks like it‚Äôs something for adults but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs for kids and every kind of age except except one through four can‚Äôt play this game because it‚Äôs really hard and I hope this person can all of this cause it looks really cool and yeah this game pretty much I gave it I will pretty much give it 100 cause stars because it is so cool and yeah I love it and I gave five because there wasn‚Äôt one 100 so yeah and I love this game and my mom has it and everybody. I hope that people love this game. ü©∑
4,bri maxwell,This is a great app to have in my opinion for me because i just  find the games calming but genuinely i hate the fact that almost EVERYTHING is premium. If i take the time out of my day to do one of these quizzes i expect results not just what it is and literally nothing else. If i want to play more than 8 games then i feel like i should because there is at least 30 games on there and just about only 8 are available that is just a little bit insane. And THE ADDS the adds just make me so angry even though this app is supposed to be calming. If im doing a word search i dont want an add halfway through . Other then these things it s a great app over all.
5,NANAPEEZY,"I accidentally came across this game and was regretting having to pay for it without a good sense of trial. However , this has changed my mind in a way. Whenever I need to refresh or reset or even calm down from overthinking , I do my daily exercise and I feel so much better. Example:- I attempted to declutter my room but it failed for months to a point I was sleeping on top of boxes. Used the game and I was ready to complete each task. 3 days after I found myself with a new looking home with less items and very much organized for the first time since I have been diagnosed with ADHD."
4,I'm agrannie,I like how the games mimic things that go on in my life every day I am learning to stay focused on what I‚Äôm doing now instead of thinking ahead about what is next. I feel like I‚Äôm making progress in the games and it shows me how I can make progress in my everyday life. When I‚Äôm doing my usual chores I can focus on what I‚Äôm doing and do a better job because I‚Äôm more focused on the process and then the outcome. If you focus on getting done you miss out on what you‚Äôre learning during your working and completing your chores. It‚Äôs surprising how important it is for the information to be learned in doing the work not necessarily finishing it as quickly as possible.
1,sayjoannA,"Day 1 no ads at all. They try to get you to upgrade to paid version which is fine/expected. I skipped it to see how I like the app before committing to that. Glad I did. Day 2 the ads start up. After the 1st minute long ad that I couldn‚Äôt skip a notification screen comes on and says ‚ÄòYou can skip ads after 5-15 seconds and they help fund further game development‚Äô. 5-15 seconds huh? Lies. There were 3 sections in todays game play. Before I could play section 1 there was a minute long ad, Section 1 game play lasted maybe 20 seconds, then another at least minute long ad.. at the 1 minute mark when the ad wasn‚Äôt finished yet I deleted the app. In the intro questions I said I wanted to braintrain for 10min a day.. at this rate that 10min will be 9min of ads and 1min of game play/brain training. This isn‚Äôt brain training this is clickbait."
3,Gayboydeluxe,"I genuinely just want to know what makes the developers think that what this app is offering is worth $28 a month. The games and exercises are good, but not particularly special. There is no lack of brain training websites available - the only thing special about this is its app format. I will say, the UI is very well done and easy to navigate, but seriously? $6.99 a WEEK? Does this truly deliver *more than double* the worth of something like netflix or curiosity that have huge libraries of content? I want the developers to get paid well for their work, but this feels excessive. If I continued paying for this for more than one week I'd feel like I got played for a fool, so I think I'll do my brain training elsewhere. Thanks anyways."
2,ThiccXHarlet,"I got this app for the iq test the app it‚Äôs self is good if you want to spend $37 on it just  for games to test your skills, I did the free trial to do Just the iq test (something that should be free) I canceled my trial because I got in a work accident and am not getting a lot of medical leave check. And to be honest I didn‚Äôt want to keep the app anyways. Because I canceled my trial they are charging me $37 for no reason. It says they charge if you cancel on the 24hour mark but exactly 24hours before the trial ends it pays for the next subscription so You get like 2 hours to cancel or they will charge you. I don‚Äôt have money to pay for my broken foot let alone $37 for a game subscription cancellation fee. For that much money you should get the app for free until you feel you don‚Äôt need the app anymore. DONT GET THIS APP üò°"
2,maniac2xs,"No complaint as far as exercises & games, but that only goes so far when after every game you play &/or button you press either leads to  an add or them trying to upsell you on subscriptions. Usually when an app offers a free trial they won‚Äôt bother you until the trial ends; not impulse. The free trial doesn‚Äôt grant you access to anything, it‚Äôs as good as not subscribing at all. Once the trial ended & I decided to subscribe weekly, they had the audacity to upsell me again with a 39$ one time payment immediately after I paid 6$ for the week. I believe the upselling & adds are counterproductive to the apps purpose. It‚Äôs ironic that the app meant to help me focus is the same one distracting me. I understand adds & subscriptions fund development, but it‚Äôs never that serious‚Ä¶"
5,OneLove317,"This is a great way to exercise our brains!  Also a great way to build good self esteem when you see your placement of % of your peers you did better than it‚Äôs almost like, I gotta give myself a pat on the back, it‚Äôs already taught me how to teach my kids their math homework, I wish I was taught that PEMDAS acronym for math order and I would‚Äôve done so much better, my worst subject is in math but it‚Äôs my children‚Äôs worst as well! So this has taught me some cool things about myself too. It‚Äôs nice that someone came up with a self motivated, self esteem lifting, attractive app! Thanks for the trial I think i may subscribe! Want the more difficult levels ! üòàü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂üèΩ"
5,ccrcmedic,I stumbled across this app while trying another as usual. Then I started with a couple questions and before I knew it I was hooked.  I have only had this app for <24 hours and half of those hours were playing!  I love the investigator/riddle mode! The scenarios ask a question and the answer is ‚ÄúFREE TEXT‚Äù and could be correct‚Ä¶ (Not sure if they read the answers and get back to me ‚Ä¶) I have PTSD and I try to find a method to ease my angst ‚Ä¶ the only thing that I don‚Äôt like is how expensive the app is for continued use (after 3-day trial)‚Ä¶ I know the App ‚ÄúHeadspace‚Äù gives an extended free use (1-Year) for people like me during a pandemic.
5,LilacMist04,"I was recently diagnosed with adhd and it is suspected I may also be on the autism spectrum.  I think my ONLY big complaint is that for the tests, many questions are too broad or too vague and it makes it difficult to answer. I think rewording or adding clarification would 100% help individuals, especially those who are neurodivergent, better understand how to answer as vague questions often confuse us or make us overthink something even if it‚Äôs meant to be simple. I think that another way to fix this is by instead of being 1-5 maybe have it be 1-7 or 1-10 for the strongly disagree to strongly agree scale. üòä"
5,Ndiacnocleer,"I‚Äôve been doing the brain training for a month or so and it was just kind of a thing I did to kill time in waiting rooms or to wind down at the end of the day. It tells you your progress but it‚Äôs easy to discard that kind of information. That is, until someone else saw me playing it and they commented on how fast I was able to complete the little games and how they could never have done that. Then, I realized how much progress I had already made. It doesn‚Äôt feel like work, they‚Äôre just games! But it exercises the parts of your brain that need worked! Love this! Thank you!"
5,App = Impulse,The app is  really good but my problem isnt the app its me i get almost all correct the only ones i got incorrect was the paper plastic sorting game and i think this can really improve you memory mental maths and more but most importantly i am 8 being able to get these puzzles right in pure seconds so this app right here i think will tell you if you are gifted or not depending on your age and skill on this great app and overall this app it's so good I give you a five star this app help you improve you're thinking skills and your brain will be able to calculate what is what in only a matter of seconds so thats why this app is a 5 STAR
5,kaylanye,"I played this game for the free trial because I looove brain workout games, but I never found one I cared for too much. As I played more and more, I enjoyed it more, and more. There is definitely so much to offer! This is by far the best brain app game I‚Äôve ever tried. I‚Äôll be 31 January 27‚Ä¶ I ended up forgetting to cancel after the trial. But I didn‚Äôt want to cancel just yet because it was THAT good.. I justified the lapse of the trial for a couple weeks because it‚Äôs my birthday lol. But I really do need to cancel because it‚Äôs too expensive sadly, unfortunatelyüòî If I wasn‚Äôt on a tight budget I would keep it for a while longer. ü§óüëäüëçüëçü´∂üèº"
5,Fradys,"You know what, I bought this a few months ago because I thought it would be good for me in the long term. Was I right? Heck yes. Even though I used to procrastinate doing it after seeing the little notifications each day, I‚Äôm starting to realize I actually enjoy doing it and I no longer see it as a task. The way they set up the games are enjoyable and I can already tell that they are helping me. I also like how there an IQ tests and self tests to help understand yourself greater. 5/5 star app as far as I am concerned. I think it‚Äôs healthy for the mind to do stuff like this. I recommend anyone to give it a shot!"
5,peace bwithyu,"If you download this to see what type of ADHD you have, you‚Äôre wasting you‚Äôre time. I already have ADHD and it said ‚ÄúSevere Signs of ADHD‚Äù and seek medical help. YOU SHOULD STILL DOWNLOAD THIS APP!   There are so many helpful brain tests you can do daily that you can set between 5, 10, or 15 minutes a day (I only did 5 because I‚Äôm way to ADHD to remember and when I do it‚Äôs too much time in my day at that moment).   Also - there are tests to learn your IQ, what your emotional intelligence is, your Archetypes, take a quick IQ, left brain vs right brain test, etc - I learned so much about myself that nobody or counselor would have ever told me. You can find what career is best suited for you too!!  I have a 129 IQ when for the longest time I thought I was completely stupid. I knew I was right brained and was drawn to music, but for a career wise I never considered it as an option. You just have to try it to understand what I mean. Do the trial at least, take the tests, you‚Äôll be changed."
5,abkgatojab,"Although I have only just completed my second day with Impulse, I am already able to see that I will benefit from following this program. Both my physical and mental fitness suffered while undergoing the rigors of caring for my Dad in my home during his last seven years, while remotely working full-time. I have been slowly building back my physical strength, but at 65 I don‚Äôt want to neglect my mental fitness. So far I am finding the program both challenging and encouraging. As well, there seems to be great kindness built into the feedback, something I genuinely appreciate and need at this point in time."
5,Grumpy Person üòíüòíüòí,"This game is awesome. However, I don‚Äôt thing paying for the game is necessary. This game is perfect for kids around 12-13, but accidentally paying for a game is not fun because anyone‚Äôs parents could get mad or something. Playing without paying is still really awesome. It‚Äôs not my decision to make you guys like not have that paying pop up thingy, but this game is still awesome. I forgot to mention at the beginning, but I would rate it a 5 and a half if I could because of the paying pop up thingy whatever. Overall, this game is a really fun one, and I wish you good luck continuing to create games/edit games :)"
5,yuhhhhboiii,"I have an attention deficit disorder so I generally get bored of apps very quickly. This is by far the best app I have purchased for the purpose of entertainment/ education/ mental training. Their are tons of different games which helps keep my attention and if I get bored of one type of game their is another I want to play. Also all the rewards and scores  that they keep track of for you really helps you enjoy the games! Getting a better score then you did last time is very satisfying, as well as seeing how well you compare to your peers. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!"
5,Hiyari chan,I‚Äôm in love with this game!üíù It is not boring like the other mental training games since the variety of small games it has is really large and each game is quite easy but at the same time it makes you think without feeling stuck or frustrated. üòÑüôåüèªThe paid version is also really cheap but even if you use the free version the ads aren‚Äôt too annoying and you have access to a lot of functions without having to pay. It takes me 5 to 10 mins a day and I already feel like I‚Äôm training my brain very well. 100% recommend. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüß†üßê

I have noticed a change in the speed in which my brain ‚Äúfires‚Äù‚Ä¶ as if to compare it to a bulave compression engine. Like in an old V8 car. The timing of the engine. I‚Äôve run more less like a sputtering & untimely mess. But it‚Äôs be more accurate and runs better‚Ä¶ my brain that is‚Ä¶ Bottom line is, it‚Äôs helping and I‚Äôll keep using it. Your brain is like a muscle except it needs more than a stress workout. This is what it needs."
2,0112592,"I like the app, I did the free trial. The problem is: I use my payment info for the free 3 day trial but if after every test I only get to see the 1st line of my test result with the huge add to unlock full results,I can choose between yearly or weekly after my 3 day trial. I will already have weekly since I had to use my payment info so I don‚Äôt need to see the ad that covers 80% of my screen for an app that‚Äôs not a free trial. The marketing to get me to purchase the app is irritating. That‚Äôs a lot of sneaky marketing for 6.99 a week or 70 a year. 6.99 is not a big deal $70 a year is not a big deal but when the marketing is making it a big deal then that‚Äôs a No for me.  Honest reviews are hard to come by. Honesty in general from anything anymore is hard to come by."
5,kirbylynne,"I really enjoy using this app instead of my Solitaire app. I enjoy both equally, but I‚Äôm just a puzzle sort of girl and I like things that are a little bit more challenging and strategic than other games available. This is such a wonderful because it‚Äôs also going to help keep my brain strong, the brain has in mind or an organ, and we have to flex them in order to keep in tact and grow as we mature over the years. I can‚Äôt recommend this up enough. I absolutely am proud of myself for buying it and for the year and I look forward to seeing my progress over the year."
5,Zayn Sami,"As a psychology and neuroscience enthusiast, Impulse has blown my brain away!   I've spent many weeks reading about brain training & cognitive performance over the past year, and specifically about boosting memory, attention, and retention.  Let me tell you, this app is what was missing from my daily life. I couldn't always train my brain when at work or university; that always ended in mental burnout. However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind.   The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment.   I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability. I wish the premium version was free so that I'd make full use of this app.   With that being said, keep up Impulse!"
5,ulawr,"I‚Äôve been trying to get into some kind of morning routine, as mornings have always been difficult for me. Despite my best efforts, I end up snoozing my alarm at least thrice and once I wake up, I start looking at my phone. Instead of having an existential crisis over a spam email, I‚Äôve been trying the exercises and taking the quizzes on this app. I find myself with less cognitive grogginess in the morning the last few days, and I go back to the exercises when I pick up my phone rather than a known stressor. It is so good to have had and still be having."
1,Valkyrie333,"Update - after using the App every day from the time I purchased the Lifetime Access option, I was suddenly blocked out of the App, and can no longer log in or even access at all. It‚Äôs like my purchase was never made, starting from square one. I did reach out to Impulse support, and received an E-mail Failure notification from G-mail. Since this doesn‚Äôt appear to be resolvable, I‚Äôm going to request a refund, through Apple and also PayPal, since they both protect buyers in this type of situation. Absolutely ridiculous.   I love this app, I thought it was great that they offered the Lifetime purchase option, which I chose to purchase. Since I‚Äôm nearing 60 years old, it definitely is important to me to stay sharp and strengthen any cognitive abilities I have and retain them. I love the different options."
5,Rezurektionist,"I had multiple heart attacks in 2004 & 2006. After that I was put on disability which was f course in that time frame was the opioid epidemic that still rages on beyond this steroidal cold & flu (China virus). After my heart started to straighten out in 2017, I got clean and I‚Äôm back to working full time. Something is foggy in my brain though. I‚Äôm startled very easily and my concentration is far from what it used to be. These tools are helping ease my mind, use it again like a muscle, and all around better my life. I appreciate apps like this and the minds that went into the process of thinking about healing a dysfunctional mindset. Thanks!"
5,kyliedyke,i think this is a really good game and it makes me happy that they ask for feedback because it feels like they actually care about the people playing the games. I like that i can play this for free with ads but also if i didn‚Äôt want ads i could pay for a subscription. i also like that if they do include ads they don‚Äôt bombard you. the games are challenging but not too challenging to the point where i can‚Äôt play. it makes me feel accomplished when i do play a game and get it right because i actually have to use my brain to figure it out. definitely one of my new favorite apps
5,Wickd Wendy,I‚Äôm 59 and I‚Äôm a college graduate and I found to my surprise that the app is fun and my brain can definitely use some training. My IQ has been tested at above average before college and then I took the IQ test in the app and I am only at the average level yet it only took me two days to get back to the point I was as a youngster but I can see where I can benefit from further training. I can see I slipped because since I‚Äôm disabled now and unable to work any longer and I‚Äôm not using my brain the way I used to I have lost the edge. Well this app makes it fun to see if I can get that edge back.
5,Rodo P,"I have been using this brain training app for a few days now and I have to say, I am impressed with the results. The app offers a variety of games that are designed to improve different cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.  I particularly enjoy the variety of games offered - from matching cards to solving puzzles, there is something for everyone. The app also has a progress tracking feature which is helpful for monitoring my progress over time.  I appreciate that the app encourages daily use, as it has become a habit for me to play the games every day. It's an enjoyable way to challenge my brain and I have noticed an improvement in my focus and concentration since I started using it.  The user interface is clean and easy to navigate, and the app runs smoothly on my device. The daily reminders are also helpful for keeping me on track.  Overall, I highly recommend this brain training app to anyone."
4,Dishatto,"The only reason I gave this app a four star review is because it has a lifetime membership. Most apps do not! The lifetime membership makes it worth it because hopefully they will improve it overtime.  Right now the games are pretty boring and even doing your absolute best you get a very low score. I can‚Äôt beat more than 4% of the population on most games, and they don‚Äôt actually give you any tips or suggestions on what you are doing wrong or how to improve. So, not sure how this app is going to improve your brain. Instead it just shows you your limitations.  Yet, something still draws me to the app.  The graphics are fantastic."
5,Sablesai,"As someone who can be a little skeptical of simple games  improving your mental focus,  after playing it for a little while I can honestly say that I do feel like I‚Äôm being mentally stimulated while I play these games. I think with all the entertainment and distractions that occupy our brain space on a daily basis I would definitely encourage others to give this app a try if they want to do something that‚Äôs going to be proactive and keep their mind sharp. The prices also seem reasonable and doesn‚Äôt seem like it  would break to many peoples pocket and the trade of would be well worth it."
1,Mortal Fool,An absolute scam! I don't even know what this app is. I have never tried it. If I downloaded it by mistake it is only because of some questionable practice where I accidentally clicked on an ad or something. I would NEVER have agreed to weekly charges.  I know what a free trial is and how you need to cancel. I did NOT knowingly try this app. But I have been charged for over 6 months. The charge is intentionally small ($6.99/week) so it blends in as an Apple charge amongst other charges on my credit card. I'm sure that is intentional so you don't notice it until too much time has passed. Apple will not even investigate a refund back past 60 days (Terrible support on Apple's part because they aren't ensuring the app developers follow their policies). I have emailed GMRD's app support. We shall see if they resolve the matter.
5,FelonyMay,"This has really improved my math and memory within just a couple days, I didn‚Äôt graduate high school and I wanted to learn more and at least keep my mind active, especially being out of school for over 5 years now, this has helped me tremendously and it‚Äôs so fun to do instead of mind numbing equations with no praise. It even tells me how well I have done compared to my peers, I love this app so far. I have no complaints what so ever! It‚Äôs also very affordable and I thank the creators for making it super simple, fun, and reliable for learning and keeping my mind active. Thank you!"
2,cowgirlbob,"I‚Äôm sorry I purchased this game. I‚Äôm aging, and interested in ‚Äúso-called‚Äù brain trainers to keep my mind sharp. This is not it. It offers the same games over and over with no feedback on how to improve. It only gives you a one line, ‚Äúyou did better than X % of your peers.‚Äù How is that helpful? There needs to be more variety. There is one game that I particularly hate, ‚ÄúArrows,‚Äù because I cannot get my touch on my phone to register and I always have to swipe several times on each arrow instead of once. It‚Äôs really frustrating.   The only reason I gave Impulse two stars instead of one is because the tests do offer some interesting and helpful information. It needs a much wider range of more interesting games and puzzles, though."
5,itsyogurllilly,Heh-sorry for advertising in the top-but this games amazing!sure I sorta wish the free trial wasn‚Äôt their but it acctully let‚Äôs me play without one unlike other games!I would recommend buying it I can‚Äôt bc I‚Äôm a kid-anyway I recommend it if you have anxiety or want too unwind I have anxiety y and also want too unwind it works like a charm you really should download it I love this app whoever hates on it is either a hamster or a type of animal No offense bc I mean that littaraley :/ it‚Äôs true tho so please buy this creators thank you so much the daily games are amazing like I am playing right now so bye ima play ur app s‚Äômore! Bye!
5,housty,"Seemed likes a very well thought out application with the science to back it up. I got interested in this because of a TBI after an assault. Many of the tests done by various therapists to gauge my cognitive abilities in order to pair with the proper PT coaches and therapists are similar to what they do in this App. It‚Äôs like having a coach or a PT leader in your phone. Day 1 was pretty painless. Low investment, high reward. By the end I could definitely feel my brain had been stimulated and was kicked into gear. Maybe only 1st gear for day one, but it was perfect and left me looking forward to what is in store tomorrow. Impressed. Excited!"
5,DaisyKellan,"I‚Äôm 24 and I have really bad ADHD and my attention span is that of a squirrel. When I downloaded this app, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much just because I‚Äôve tried these apps before and could never stick with them. When I tell you I love this app, I mean it with my whole heart. The reminders aren‚Äôt too frequent but frequent enough that I can see them and I‚Äôm not getting drowned in stupid notifications. I‚Äôm able to focus on the games because they aren‚Äôt too long and I even find myself playing more after my daily exercises. Thank you so much to the creator of this app!"
5,Mini.Mousse,"At work I have open space at random times while I wait for customers, so having a game to play in the meantime that‚Äôs got variety makes the day more enjoyable! The visuals are also very pleasing, it‚Äôs not the most funky app but the simplicity is nice, it‚Äôs different than what I‚Äôm normally around. It also keeps track of the days you‚Äôve done in a week, which I am not personally the biggest fan of but I‚Äôm sure someone would appreciate it. There is additional practices/games able to play for cash, but even then the free ones are enough to appreciate the app."
4,wzxvvm,Quick and easy games and challenges make you feel accomplished. I really enjoy seeing how I measure compared to others so it gives me a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses. I let my son play the color connecting game- and I was amazed at how quickly he was able to navigate the game to level 10! Made us both feel really awesome. Very excited to see this platform expand. It would be great if there was at least an option for a free version where you could only play a limited number/ limited game access for those who do not have the disposable income for games but still deserve a mental health break.
5,jbwillia,"It‚Äôs fun, challenging and you get to see how you‚Äôve stood up on each challenge to their user base as a whole. It‚Äôs much better than those meme quizzes you find on social media. It‚Äôs still new, so I don‚Äôt know this: it would be cool if it somehow integrated with social media such you could also be compared to people that you know. It would also be cool if your ongoing progress could be tracked to produce and show your iq based on your collective results over time.  Altogether it‚Äôs quick, it‚Äôs a quick easy and fun way to exercise your brain without any sweat‚Ä¶"
5,Calimilf78,"Keep your mental cognitive abilities sharp as you age couldn‚Äôt be more important! Keeping your mind actively engaged (watching TV doesn‚Äôt count) helps to keep dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs at bay and slows its progression. I work in senior home health care and have seen the difference of what happens and how fast it can between individuals who remain active and read and engage their brain in more than tv and those who don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs in your best interest to keep your mind active, engaged and challenged. There couldn‚Äôt be anything more important to do for yourself as you age except perhaps practicing balance! Lol"
2,Sbro1133,"Took the first few exercises, really enjoy it nominated to be in the free trial run of course not gonna spend 6.99 a week on something I don‚Äôt try first right! Anyway liked the first few exercises then the first 72 question test came up telling you what type of archetype you have and type of personalities that stuff got all the way threw the test and here come the results‚Ä¶ all right cool let‚Äôs see these results‚Ä¶. NOT how about you pay 6.99 a week for these results even though your in the trial mode‚Ä¶. ABSOLUTE TRASH AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD A PAYING CUSTOMER ON THE HOOK WAS GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR APP AND I DONT PAY FOR ANY APPS I MEAN NON!! Good job showing what‚Äôs to come in the future if I did pay for the app‚Ä¶. Y‚Äôall need to rethink what free trial means absolute garbage not cool!"
5,NoPauseButton,"Using this app has made me become more intellectually aware of my own capabilities and my downfalls. This app is a good way to learn more about yourself and really round out your character, making you into a better person as a whole. Definitely recommend this app to anyone. Especially to those that may feel lost or in a rut. This app made me realize that I actually have an iq of 134, and I feel more motivated to learn more skills because of that. Hopefully this app will reach more people and give them the eye opening experience that I have acquired."
5,LRK7717,Impulse has so many interesting games and exercises that challenge your mind in so many ways. It even reviews some math lessons if you need a refresher. It does cost a little money. In the registration process it makes it seem like your cheapest option is a 3-day free trial and then $6.99/week but then I clicked on the x and was able to start to play. Then a screen popped up in which you need to guess where the reward was and I found an 89% off coupon. I decided that $0.57/week was worth it. Good luck finding a good coupon! Try not to get addicted like I am!
5,are there no nicknames anymore,"I‚Äôve definitely noticed some improvements in my ability to focus and hold more information in my brain at once, which I struggle with. So this app works for sure. I purchased the lifetime subscription as I‚Äôm very fond of brain training apps/games and I‚Äôm definitely glad I did with this app. I hope the developers will cycle in new games so that mastering a brain skill continues to be fun. I‚Äôve nearly maxed out all the games and I‚Äôm not sure I would continue to reap the training benefits once I have because I will probably stop playing the games with no new levels to beat."
5,BbDL4L,Impulse review keeps me busy and I also can practice and learn new things. I think everyone should have the impulse app because every now and than you need a little help. to remind yourself of how smart you actually are or how much smarter you can be. Practice makes perfect. You forget some things the older you get but impulse improves and helps remind me how much I not only miss school but how I wish I were young again. Teachers don‚Äôt stress enough how important school is and what learning can do and it also make a person who they are if not more.
1,Ginger_123,"This is by far one of the most greediest companies ever. I downloaded this app because I saw it on Facebook. I then deleted it because it costed money. (I did this forever ago and forgot I even downloaded it). I got a call from my bank telling me that someone in California was trying to charge money to my account on ITunes for 42 dollars. I thought someone stole my information and was trying to buy stuff with it. So I cancelled my card, and got a new one. Every time I try to download something on my App Store, it won‚Äôt let me because I owe money. I thought it was because of my card being cancelled until I got a new one that still didn‚Äôt work and called Apple. I‚Äôve been trying to get these people to delete the charge from my account and they aren‚Äôt replying to me. And I‚Äôm not going to pay the money for a subscription I never made."
3,Touchngo1976,"As a person with deutan color deficiency (very common among those who are color blind) I must tell you that your ‚Äúcolor blind‚Äù version of the Fans Count game where you count uniforms of different colors is not very color blind friendly. Using small shapes in a uniform is not distinctive enough to quickly count. I still try to rely on color however the blue and purple(?) uniforms (the ones with circle and a square) are very difficult for a color deficient person to tell apart quickly.  It would be better if you changed this game to not use a uniform, but instead use an entire shape colored differently and don‚Äôt use purple and blue. Use one or the other but not both."
5,megd4adhd,"Definitely worth it. I paid for the year and I use it consistently for periods of time when I remember. There are many many different choices for games and it does help improve speed for making connections quicker I have noticed. It also seems easy for a lot of them, but they have enough levels that it can get difficult enough so you don‚Äôt get bored from it being too easy. I have severe adhd and I am hoping it can help improve focus. I need routine so this is an extra thing I have added to help. Love it so far!"
5,Gabeh911,Epilepsy has caused me a tremendous amount of memory loss and I‚Äôm in the process of retraining my brain. This app has been amazing in aiding me during that process. There‚Äôs so many different learning games that are genuinely entertaining and the ones I use are nearly identical to the tasks I practice with my speech therapist(memory doctor). I paid for the app without much concern as one visit to my doctor is something like twice the cost of the lifetime subscription. It‚Äôs truly and excellent game and a go to of mine whenever I have downtime.
3,Btrfly9,"UPDATE: I will give credit to the developer for reaching out. The app did not charge me a second time. I did cancel within the first day of having the app and it should not have charged me at all. So I will give this 3 stars instead of 1.   I downloaded the free trial and played for about an hour. It's not bad but I decided I did not want to pay for it. I cancelled after about an hour of play. Looking in my subscriptions it said it expired in the three days. HOWEVER on the third day (expiration day) it charged me $6.99 for 7 MORE DAYS OF PLAY! When I open the subscription now there is NO CANCEL option, only renewal options. You are ripping me off!!!! Reporting your app!!!"
4,MrFal$etto,"It‚Äôs a cool app, accurate test results and fun games.  I just thought it was funny that after I signed up for a 3 day free trial to premium then did a 20 min IQ test I would have access to the test results but they wanted me to upgrade from my 3 day premium trial to an actual premium subscription which is something I‚Äôv never seen an app do before lol.  I will continue to use this app because it is pretty cool but it would of been nice if they stuck to there word when they said ‚ÄúFree Trial‚Äù for all premium access.  I can‚Äôt afford a subscription I have too many cause all crap is now days is subscriptions, I‚Äôm broke because of it."
5,Burke Raleigh,"I‚Äôm always conscious of keeping up with my brain health. I‚Äôm 38 and I love the idea of technology helping us a few mins a day to stay more productive in the ol‚Äô noggin.  I had another brain game app that I did for 103 days straight! But eventually I got bored with is. This is similar but also a whole new set of games. And what I also love is it tells you what you need to accomplish to level up! *  * the other game I used would almost randomly level me up, it didn‚Äôt make any sense at times how it would be achieved. I like accomplishing goals but that‚Äôs just me"
5,6Iron6Megan6,"I have been enjoying this game SO MUCH. I have been personally dealing with some cognitive issues, this game has been my official go-to getaway. It is so hard to take time for yourself, and for me I tend to feel a bit guilty when I do. This helps me center myself and allows me to step back. It offers a healthy distraction, and I never feel drained post play. My ADHD completely swallows me up sometimes, and I‚Äôm trying to be less medication dependent and more productive with my day to day activities.  Thank you soooo much for creating such a wonderful app!"
2,Lfree4,"When I looked at getting this app, it stated VERY clearly that there was a 3-day free trial, after which my iTunes account would be charged. It also stated very clearly that to cancel this, it would have to be more than 24 hours before the three days was up. Got it. Check and check.  I figured with so many positive ratings, it has to be legit and above board, so I proceeded.   Upon installation, it also stated very clearly that I could cancel in the settings of the app. Ummmm... there are precisely ZERO ways to cancel in the settings of the app. Zero. I‚Äôve ‚Äúleft feedback‚Äù through there, but there are no account settings to be found anywhere in this app. Highly disappointed at the intention deception here. I will be notifying Apple directly that I do not authorize any charges for this app."
5,uhjiyyf.imimkil,"I‚Äôve been playing this for 2 years. I recommend it to everyone. A family member recently moved in with us and had suffered from mental abuse as well as little to no logical thinking. I bought this app for them and they have improved tremendously in just 2 weeks. They are almost addicted to it, because when they do good, or win a game it releases dopamine - improving their mental motivation in critical thinking as well as boosting their overall well-being of confidence. I can not recommend this app enough."
5,Lys Brooke,"Honestly, when I downloaded this game I thought I would be bored of it after a few minutes. But there are so many different games and puzzles you can do that you literally have so many options to play you just never really get bored. I downloaded this game yesterday and I play to at least level 25 on each game before I moved forward to try another one. This game is super fun and he‚Äôs there are some parts of it that are locked until you pay for it but you still have so many options to use for free! I really do love this game!"
2,XXhackssss,"Look, it does actually match the ads that promoted it, which was nice, unlike some games. However, paying to get your results seems kinda like a jerk move. You know you don‚Äôt HAVE to squeeze every dollar out of people that just want to take tests and puzzles to relax! I got this app thinking it was going to be playable (due to its 4.7 rating). Turns out those people who rated it are probably either really rich, really gullible, or complete liars. This game is not playable, I‚Äôm tired of being asked to pay yearly/weekly (I‚Äôve only played this game for 10 minutes now), and can we have the option to get our results by watching an ad? At least then this app might get 3 stars outta me."
5,Eva Ava queen eva,Bro I wanted to sleep more so I started playing this game when I supposed to go to sleep and it help me go to sleep right away and this also trained my mind for school aswell I just love these brain training and I love it so much I love it I love it I love it and I love it I love the way you are you know I love you and you have the same feelings and you have my feelings so you are the one who are you and you know that you have the brain training And I love it because you‚Äôre my best I have to go and I‚Äôm a really good teacher and you are you have you have to do
1,Ikerus,"If you are going to charge for using your app, just put the cost up front, before you download it. Don‚Äôt try and see if you can catch people off by making it free and then right after your splash screen (before actually using your app) throw in a cost to use the app. There‚Äôs a difference between apps the cost money to download and in app purchases. This is the bastard of the two, trying to sneak in a app that cost money up front, but after you download it for free. You don‚Äôt do this as a marketing strategy, you do this because you know there‚Äôs a chance that some people won‚Äôt notice. Hoping that someone will see it‚Äôs free and miss the outrageous cost of $7 a week. You‚Äôre app isn‚Äôt worth $7 in total let alone weekly. This app should be flagged and taken down. For trying to take advantage of people."
3,asher 7233,So far I like it just not the fact that the ads are so heavy or the pushing on about how I need to pay. As a person who struggles with mental health or just likes to take my mind off bad things I go to impulse but the heavy amount of ads distract me or the constant pressure to pay for this app is honestly to much for me. But I continue to use it because it does work well when I need it. So thank you impulse but it‚Äôs hard to use when mentally all you think about is if you need to be paying and if you don‚Äôt how much are you truly missing. It‚Äôs a great app but if you really want to help make it less pushing it‚Äôs a lot to take. Overall a great app tho üòÅüëçüèæ
5,Dana Doo roo,I am thoroughly enjoying impulse at this early start because my brain is sharp already but getting older and body is slowing down. So I need these exercises to help accommodate the body trying to keep up. The exercises are challenging yet fun. They keep you focused and do not leave room for distraction. It is easy to stay on point when so challenged on the game and exhibit discipline for yourself to stay on task for the exercise. I love it and most likely will continue after trial. I am also experimenting with having fewer headaches and handle stress more effectively.
5,Andrew Hopper,"This app is one of the few I‚Äôll take the time to write a review on. The yearly plan is incredibly worth while if you are serious about personal exploration and personal growth. This app is 100% something I believe in. After just one month of using it I can honestly say that I am more alert of myself and those around me. I have since departed from a unhealthy state of mind and sharpened my intellect. I highly recommend this app, not just to a select few, but everyone. This app is worth while in more than one way."
5,Stonefly88,After being traumatized in a life changing event PTSD has turned my world upside down. Fighting anxiety on a daily basis has changed my way of thinking and processing real life problems. This app has helped me reduce anxiety while retraining my thinking habits by focusing on the problems in front of me while building my condo in myself knowing that I am ok and that I still can solve problems like other people who don‚Äôt have PTSD! Thank you for creating this app it has saved my life! Thank you!
5,ùîêùî¢ùî™,"Not only does it give you something to do if your bored, but also helps literally train your brain, you can also take an IQ test that I thought was really cool and everything is easy to follow and fun! Let‚Äôs ur brain wind down in a GREAT WAY cause it benefits you at the same time! There‚Äôs not many apps I end up keeping because they tend to bore me after a while or you find you just don‚Äôt use them but this one is definitely something special and worth keeping! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!!!ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèºüíØüíØüíØ"
4,Vanillacocobean,"Yes it‚Äôs true! Trying this app was on an actual impulse for me. Pun intended lol! So far I‚Äôm liking the app. I‚Äôm not too far but I‚Äôm already giving a review, so what does that tell you?  I look forward to continuing the fun games it‚Äôs giving me. In hopes it helps my confidence even in the little things. Every little bit helps! Especially if it‚Äôs Made to help! Which it‚Äôs said this app impulse does help improve your thinking cognitively. And just your everyday living, focus and attention. I plan to continue playing. I‚Äôm not the type of person to continue in something if I feel it‚Äôs a waste of time. So enough said.üòå"
1,Wild turkey101,"I only wanted to evaluate the app but instead they signed me up for $6.99 a month!   App looked interesting and showed a 3day free trial. However, when I clicked ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù to the next screen to evaluate the rates and conditions, it automatically subscribes you for $6.99 a WEEK!!  Holy hell that‚Äôs a massive bait and switch.  App pops up a quick ‚Äúyou can cancel from settings‚Äù note after they fraudulently subscribed you. So,  I knew I was screwed so decided to cancel that minute. Nope!! It‚Äôs no where to be found in settings. Here is where you find it:  It‚Äôs in your subscriptions tab inside your ITunes and App Store section inside your Apple ID section. Wow! Blown away at how it subscribed me without showing me pricing, terms, condition or confirmation that I actually wanted to subscribe.  To developer: don‚Äôt even waste your time responding you fraudulent SOB!"
1,Slou5,"I have never written a review for an app until now. My experience has been so frustrating that I feel obligated to comment and warn others. It was a great app for the first 3 days. I completed the daily games and was even spending an extra 30 minutes on the extra games. But Day 4 I was bombarded with repeated extended video game ads with no way to skip. Clicking on the arrow to skip just brought me to the purchase app sceeen. Closing and reopening app just opened the ad again or to the Home Screen but when I clicked on start playing the brain games, it went straight to the ads again in a maddening loop. I really enjoyed this app and am so disappointed I have to delete it, but this is ridiculous."
5,Zack_Rose27,This app is really helpful. But you do have to pay to see your results but the games help you build concentration and other skills you are having problems with. I have a hard time concentrating on other stuff and the concentration games do help. I do recommend this app. Even though i got it 4/16. I do want to have it to where you can check on your results daily. Like you can check on of your results and you can‚Äôt check any other results for the day. That‚Äôs what i would want to see. üòÖ
2,wisp58,"Downloaded the game just over 2 months ago. Played daily and experienced good progress. Game algos appeared to be well written and fair as well as encouraging progress. I have played several ‚Äòbrain‚Äô games and this one seems likely to increase its set targets of memory, speed of thought, thinking agility etc. I‚Äôm also familiar with many of the psyche tests offered, took Al of them and they were consistent with previous results.    BUT ‚Ä¶. I ventured into 2 IQ tests ‚Ä¶ the 30 min 60 ques and the shorter 15 min 30 question and both tests contained questions in which the right answer was NOT one of the choices available. In the 60 ques test (which was a similar format of ques as the std Stanford Binet and Weschler tests) 6 questions I encountered did not contain the right answer in the options given. I‚Äôve taken the Stanford Binet and Weschler multiple times over the decades as a matter of curiosity to gage how my IQ might have changed. Neither of these tests proffer an accurate set of questions.   For what it‚Äôs worth.   For a very well written game for someone interested in brain work is Lumosity."
5,Muhamad Raqib Argoshi,"Impulse is a dynamic app designed to enhance cognitive abilities through engaging exercises. With its diverse range of challenges targeting memory, attention, problem-solving, and processing speed, users of all ages can benefit. The app's adaptive learning system adjusts difficulty levels based on individual progress, ensuring a personalized experience. Gamification elements such as points, achievements, and leaderboards add a fun and motivating dimension to the learning process. Overall, Impulse offers a sleek, intuitive platform for anyone looking to sharpen their mind and boost their mental agility."
3,Litany Against Fear,"I‚Äôve tried reporting the bug via Apple and via the Impulse app, maybe a review will help.   This is a great app. I was recently diagnosed with moderate inattentive-type ADHD (I‚Äôm 45 and it‚Äôs been undiagnosed since childhood) and have put the daily training into my morning routines. Then, throughout the day, I‚Äôll play the candy sort game to give my brain a different engaging activity, but I have a curious bug that will make me replay stages I‚Äôve already passed.  I can see no rhyme or reason to it. If I replay a stage, I‚Äôd like it to be because I want to, not because the app seems to think I haven‚Äôt even though the next stage is open."
5,Indigo Vice,So first off the App is easy to use and gives you valuable insights on how your brain works. Doing theses exercises does help so try to test out how you feel/react throughout the day. In terms of challenges once you reach the max level you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù restart to see if you can speed through the course. Which is a bummer because it would‚Äôve been neat to try again from level one. Other thank that this app is Amazing in helping my ADHD and to pass the time while on work breaks. Keeps you sharp and witty.
4,Youllcallitfate,"I love this game, however when I subscribed I was under the impression there would be a minimum of 200 puzzles, I only have access to 180. As well as one of the badges being for completing 250 puzzles, which again caps at 180. I also submitted a help ticket at least a week ago because my training streak was resetting often when it shouldn‚Äôt have been, and received no response at all. I won‚Äôt continue my subscription until these issues are at least acknowledged but will continue playing in hopes that customer service is important to the developers ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,Coley1222,"As title suggests, I decided to go with the one year plan. 6.99 a week sounded too steep. I was going to go with free trial at first but I remembered the good reviews. I have adhd combined typed. When my brain is idle, I become depressed. With this app, I don‚Äôt have to feel like that. There are daily routines to do but also there are games just for fun that also help build skills such as problem solving, memory retention, and MATH! I hate math but this app makes it fun and has refresher tips and solutions to help you solve and get better. Best purchase this year!!"
4,Lady ‚ÄúT‚Äù,"Update:  appreciate the update.   Seems the math section was fixed with key boards/choices of numbers.    Unfortunately it seems Tasty fractions was overlooked.    Still enjoy the app but not being able to do tasty fractions is causing me not to have a steady streak.  This app was recommended to me and I truly enjoy until I get to fractions. I can not input my information. No drawing with pencil, finger , or even tapping on screen for keyboard. So, I never get to earn daily tasks. I am hoping there‚Äôs a glitch somewhere and the team is working on this so the app can be updated. I really do not want to delete this app."
1,Ephemera Fae,One thing that really bothers me is this slippery way apps get us in and then make it ridiculous to climb out. This app is exceptional at that from what I‚Äôve seen. It literally told me to ‚Äúcancel any time in the App Store‚Äù here I am on the App Store with no clear place to go.   I look into apps like this to help in my life long recovery from multiple concussions.  I was drawn to this one because it brings in information about Teauma responses which is of particular interest to me since my trauma responses trigger seizures since my last head injury.   That last thing I need is another to do on my list threatening to hit me with a bill or overdraft me because I tried to cancel OUT of the screen and instead it signed me into a free trail.
5,knowswords,"Just two days using this app. The games are good and can maintain the attention levels well enough. I am in 62 years old and the exercises I am being offered to train with feel like a remediate level. Stats as compared to others doing same training exercises an extra that some might like to see in order to motivate to keep up with brain training. The IQ test is a bonus, too! Give Impulse app a try. You feel as though it is worth it to spend ten minutes a day or more helping to keep your brain active."
2,üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüòòüòòüòòüòò,"This game is awesome in so many ways, except the biggest one.. customer service. I rated 2/5 stars because of the condescending and belittling customer service I received via email. I was concerned, and a little confused about a purchase I made within the app. So I emailed IMPULSE and requested assistance. Since IT/developing is not my forte, I was inquisitive on the issue. From the beginning of our conversation IMPULSE was surprisingly curt, discourteous, and not happy to help a confused customer. This is an awesome game if you never make a purchase mistake, and never need any of their help. I hope the developers will take a look at the poor correspondence I received from their company and take action so that it does not happen to another unsuspecting person."
4,R.LeeShelton,"I have ADHD as well as being a night owl in a early bird society, so it takes a lot to kickstart my brain in the morning. This is a good way to spend 10 minutes before I have to begin my day that wakes me up a bit before my morning caffeine kicks in. I knock off a star because some of the games ‚Äútutorials‚Äù do not translate really on the goal + you cannot repeat the same type of game, they will give you different games each time you log in. So if I wanted to redo a game after figuring out what the tutorial actually meant half way through the game, I am unable to do so"
5,**_SCAMMERS__!!,"I‚Äôve noticed since my diagnosis in the last 30 years of my life by memory and being able to place things like I used to multitask, has gotten less efficient as I started playing Impulse to see if it would help retrain or remind my brain how to function properly. Impulse app is making me think quickly efficiently so far so it‚Äôs great I dont have any complaints if you‚Äôre dealing with some of the things the same things you might want to do a trial period and see if it helps you the same"
1,Lockwood5poet,"I am sad to leave this review, because I was enjoying checking out your content, and would‚Äôve been happy to pay for it when I had the money. I literally don‚Äôt right now, which turned out to be a good thing, because the app made no less than three unauthorized charge attempts. üò≥  The only thing I authorized was the free trial. I know because there was even text on that screen that said ‚ÄúYou will not be charged at this time.‚Äù It would certainly be easy for someone to accidentally authorize a payment to you with all the different offers and popups offering the paid version, but I was very careful to X out of all those or tap the ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äú button. Those were mildly annoying, but I wouldn‚Äôt have even minded that too much.  I DO, however, mind that you tried to charge me without my permission. Your multiple attempts (rightly) triggered my bank‚Äôs fraud alert, and I had to make several calls to get my check card unfrozen. I could‚Äôve done without that annoyance too.   Fix your app so this sort of thing doesn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôve seen apps removed from the App Store for this kind of thing."
1,DataBro,"To preface, I am not one to normally write reviews but this company is an absolute cash-grab nightmare.   I am sure many of you will find this app via targeted advertising on various social media platforms as I did myself. When you first download the app, you have to answer 6 questions before you‚Äôre asked to immediately purchase a plan. Feel free to do the 3 day free trial, which immediately launches a ‚Äúprize‚Äù where you magically get 92% off a yearly subscription ‚Äúon this screen only‚Äù.   Perhaps you‚Äôre still unsure, as you literally haven‚Äôt been able to use the app yet - so like myself you skip the screen instead of paying $30 for a 90% DISCOUNTED subscription. Then you take a test, which lasts 72 questions. When you finish you‚Äôd think with your 3 day free trial you‚Äôd get to see your results right? WRONG. Instead you get a message saying results are only available for those with a subscription, which does not include a the 3-day trial apparently.  Meaning, that unless you are willing to pay $30 upfront for tests that are largely available online for free, then this is an absolutely useless application."
5,ginbin01746,"I love to procrastinate on my phone so this app gives me a reason to play games that are actually benefiting me instead of doing things that are non productive. I‚Äôm super ADHD so mini breaks are super important so maximizing my productivity. That being said, the impulsiveness that comes with my ADHD gets me sucked into whatever app I open during those breaks. With this one, I know I‚Äôm benefiting myself and it‚Äôs easier to get off the app rather than scrolling through TikTok where every different video is supposed to grab my attention and keep me drawn in. Great app idea!"
2,Nirettzy,"Downloaded the app to check it out. Of course they wanted money up front before anything but I elected the free 3 day trial (a joke I know). Did a couple games that turned out well, another pop up for money dangling 92% off. Declined that offer and moved to the archetype test. You wants results? Pay! Either sign up for the subscription or pay $5 to get the report.   While I have no problem paying for a quality product or service, I have to know it‚Äôs quality first. By not providing the results, how am I to know whether I‚Äôd be satisfied? With no refund recourse, I‚Äôll pass. Developers must learn to earn trust before demanding money like every other business out there."
3,XxtouhouxX,"Good enough for me to play it. Solid variety of games and puzzles for your enjoyment. But I‚Äôm here more to give constructive criticism for the app. The app needs more math games and an actual ranking system, not one that I feel like is fictional. How convenient that beating lvl 10 at any game means I‚Äôm better than 99% of everyone else, every time. That‚Äôs just silly. You can continue to fool most people or you can do right and actually implement a ranking system. Additionally, there‚Äôs a lot of pseudoscience. The worst offender being the personality tests. Next you‚Äôre going to be doing horoscopes (sarcasm). I‚Äôm only being critical because I want this app to be better and more legitimate."
5,Nea b,"I really love this app! I have ADHD, anxiety and depression and I need something to help me quiet my mind and focus on just one thing at a time, but with other things like Tetris (which i love) is that it bores me fast because it becomes the same. What I love of this one is that it's not ""one"" game, but each level or game is different, so I don't get bored and I feel excited to get the next one right but it's something new, so my brain stays focused because it's interesting. I don't really mind the ads although it would be nice to not have so many cuts."
5,i‚ù§Ô∏èmac,The whole setup impulse has is cool. Us choose a goal and then they calculate how many games/time u need to put in to reach that goal. Im almost 40 and want to stay sharp for my lil one...also I like how straight forward the directions and explanations are. Compared to other similar apps... Directions were quick to pick up and start practicing/playing brain games... The refresher on math lessons I thought was cool and haven't seen that before.. Will def need to spend some time doing that lol... All in all cool app... Ads r quick n skippable. Kudos nice job on the app!
2,ImBigPapasWife,"I did the free trial to see if I liked it and to do the tests to see my results. It keeps trying to get to to purchase the subscription and it blocks out your test results until you pay a weekly, monthly, or yearly membership. No thanks. I went ahead and canceled my free trial. Honestly what‚Äôs the point of a free trial if you‚Äôre not even giving me the full experience? I can find other game teaser games to play for free. I‚Äôm all about supporting a company and paying a subscription fee, but, I‚Äôm not about doing that and they constantly try to get extra money. That usually means they want the money quickly because there‚Äôs only so much you can do in the app. No thanks! I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere."
5,Tomato Chips,After being evaluated for ADHD and ASD my psychiatric team recommended I take preventative action to delay cognitive decline. One of the recommendations given to me was to play games like the ones in Impulse to keep my mind sharp. I‚Äôve found this app to be very enjoyable and a nice way to relax for a few minutes in the evening. Many of the games in this app resemble the tasks I had to complete during my neuropsychological assessments. The graphics are pleasant. I can tell a lot of thought and care was put into creating this app.
1,Reviewer2597,"Impulse - Brain Training is a scam. This application should be banned and is not worth even downloading. The app is incredibly basic but before you can even try it out, you are forced to choose a paid subscription with a shortened 3 day trial. I‚Äôm not unfamiliar to these trials charging you even if you cancel but what is particularly scummy about these developers is they do not have an email or phone number you can contact them at. On every attempt to get in touch you are referred to the subscription page in your settings. I will continue to find out how I can get a refund or simply file a report through my bank and encourage you to do the same. Please leave a like or comment if you had canceled during your trial and are looking to do the same."
5,Lucky_girl_329,"I am SO glad that I downloaded this app and turned on the notifications because it would've ended up in the second page in my app folder in my phone. Which means that I would never use it again and I would delete the app. (if all that made sense) But luckily I turned on the notifications and it motivated me to work my brain out. However, I am a tiny bit upset about the ads. But, that one little problem still made it to the ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ. (5 stars) Thank you for your time.  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î"
5,JmanGuajardo,This app is amazing! I absolutely love brain games and this app has so many different ones to hit all the aspects of day to day intelligence. This helps me stay super sharp. I often find myself playing more games than is included in my daily training. Great user interface and runs very smoothly. They‚Äôve nailed all the gamification aspects too to keep me coming back. My favorite aspect is to see how well I stack up against others in my age group within each level of each training game.
5,Queen-Chief,I don‚Äôt usually have much time to play or be entertained so having not just any game but ‚ÄúIMPULSE‚Äù captivates my brain activities in multiple ways like I‚Äôm working out in a gym. Just 5-10 minutes/daily helps increases my ability to think quickly and accurately. It a brain gym. Note I don‚Äôt know the makers and this is not a promotion I‚Äôm a real person and as a matter of fact a nurse. I use it to get my brain off the floor and to help me solve problems on impulse. You can try it too but remember it‚Äôs not like any other games.
5,Mentally EEL,"I am really enjoying this app! i‚Äôm a recovering addict, so I have burned through most of my brain cells in life. I was also in a coma for an amount of time and have a brain injury as well.  In addition, I have a history of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs on both sides of my family. I can already see the improvement in my thinking, and the ability to remember things accurately or at all. I shared what I have been doing on this impulse app just this morning in my substance use disorder class. I recommend to anyone of all ages and health conditions."
5,Treetop67z,I‚Äôm loving this game but I can‚Äôt afford to pay for it and that makes me sad because lord knows I need it. 56 years old and I already can see my mental capacity is dwindling fast and I‚Äôm seriously scared of what will come next. I already spend way too much time looking for keys and purse and can‚Äôt remember what I have to do and get lost in places I have been all my life. So if this game can help I would love it but I‚Äôm just not financially prepared to spend any money my house payment takes my entire check every month
2,webtoon_fan123,I was watching tick tock and I saw an ad for this saying that it shows your iq gives you test to see what you‚Äôre iq is and it can even compare it it famous genius‚Äôs but when I downloaded the app it did not do any of the things listed but despite the ads lies what is does it help you exercise your brain and make you smarter (not tell you how smart you are though) and the app is good but they need to have better ads also another thing is that on one of the games (the memory game with cards) it was a little buggy and the cards change images from when I saw it to when I was guessing (hope that made sense) so it is a mostly good app but the ads lie
5,Mooshoolina21,"Haven‚Äôt been playing too long but I really enjoy the games. I‚Äôve been in a mental health journey to be better for my kids, so I‚Äôve been exploring all kinds of apps and things to help me be accountable for myself and help me in different ways. As a single mom with 2 kids taking care of everything to make sure the world doesn‚Äôt stop turning, I forget a lot of things and this app so far has helped me be more mindful I‚Äôm still using the free version and I don‚Äôt mind the pop up"
2,CurieShakes,"I got this entirely because it‚Äôs advertised on Instagram (and the App Store) as an app to aid in understanding your ADHD type. First off the app offered a free week trial - I selected the lifetime payment option and it charged me immediately, did not give me any free trial. Downhill from there. There is a test for if you have ADHD or not, but the test advertised on Instagram and on the App Store ‚ÄúWhat is your ADHD type‚Äù with archetypes like ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù, ‚Äúinattentive‚Äù, ‚Äúlimbic‚Äù, etc doesn‚Äôt exist in the app. So the whole reason I got the app, to understand my ADHD better, isn‚Äôt part of the app at all. There are some games and such to keep your mind sharp, but if you‚Äôre looking to use this as an ADHD tool this is NOT tailored to you."
5,Prttony,"Was skeptical of another ‚Äúmental training app‚Äù but find this to be a great alternative to blowing things up and chasing zombies games.   This app makes you feel like your actually exercising your mind through the mini activities (games) but still challenges what you think should be easy activities (matching pairs no problem! Basic math no problem!) which turn out to be interestingly challenging.  I play before bed or while drinking coffee in the AM or if just passing time waiting somewhere to get to the next level.   Interesting stats, tips and ranking against your age group make it even more involved so you see where you are against your age group.   If you‚Äôre looking for something to stimulate your mid (because you think you‚Äôre always forgetting things or worries about your mental fitness I.e. always a forgetting things :) ) then give a go!"
4,CelesteM01,"I really like the game so far. BUT, like anything health care, and YES, mental wellness is health care, they demand that you pay a premium to have your God given right to be healthy and happy. I can‚Äôt afford, and I seriously doubt anyone who really needs this type of help can.  However, if you can afford it, I would highly recommend you that you do! It‚Äôs designed to keep improving your skills. You can compete with others or ignore the leader board and compete with yourself. (Which I highly recommend).  Overall I think it‚Äôs a good app, I just deducted the one star because of the pricing."
1,best use of my screen time,"Dissappointed. Cant see test results without paying. Think this should be explained prior to taking the test as its then a waste of time if you choose not to purchase. Wont be keeping app. Have no idea if the information provided/results are something I would value so no reason to subscribe. Should be better at allowing people to experience the app prior to purchasing to see if they like or not. Makes me think limited materials available/scam. Then, won‚Äôt allow you to send feedback without adding email. Also, if you play a couple games they offer subscriptions at up to 92% off weekly - like 56% a week. Don‚Äôt pay that up front price!"
5,Silviaung18,"Not only is the app affordable, it hosts quality games that are interesting and challenging, and you can tailor / explore the games to your needs /liking. I love that they share results w/ you after each game and explain your aptitude after each test, and where you place among others who have played. Overall, I think these are great brain exercises when you need them and doesn‚Äôt waste your brain cells unlike other apps that you might use on your phone. ;P"
5,nsnzt snsusvjd,"Impulse is a great game! The app has fun games challenging games and gives you games depending on what you need help with. For and example if you want to make your memory stronger, impulse gives you fun games to help you complete your goal. If you also wanna learn about math they have mini lesson on multiplication, decimals, order of operations, ect. The game also has quizzes to see what type of person you are based on the answers you pick. Great game overall I totally recommend downloading it. And you can play for free!"
5,ColonelSchizo,"I‚Äôve been looking for an app that focuses only on little games that keep my attention and help critical thinking. I have severe ADHD and the short games that are always changing really keep my attention. Not the same thing over and over.   It‚Äôs also affordable and worth it to get rid of the ridiculous ads that make you want to never touch whatever they are advertising.   I‚Äôm always wanting to improve myself and this app helps me do that, if only by a little at a time."
2,The report- NOW,"I know you  people out there need a way to make money. But if you made this app to help people, I don‚Äôt think you should have made it so only the ones with money could ‚Äúaccess‚Äù you‚Äôre app. You see not everybody has money to put into apps like this, but they still wanna follow as the apps intended to do. But like I said, it doesn‚Äôt help having a ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù to actually ‚Äúaccess‚Äù you‚Äôre app. Make an app that can help people without shoving a ‚Äúmoney-grab‚Äù in their face. And I‚Äôm not asking for apologies, I‚Äôm asking for improvement. So please do something about it. Like more access to more games or something like that; the app is very limited without the subscription. I know it says that it‚Äôs limited but it‚Äôs a little TOO limited."
1,2soon2review,"As someone who is truly trying to exercise their brain and grow, I am very disappointed with my purchase. I am about two weeks in and I‚Äôm frustrated that their is a time limit. I payed for this, I should get a fair chance to do all of the puzzles without being cut short because it takes me a little longer than you think it should. I‚Äôm very upset and I recommend that if you have anxiety or have a hard time with time limits or being ripped from you concentration state with a big red bell telling you that you‚Äôre too slow to finish when you have two puzzles left. If this was advertised as a race against the clock joke I would have saved my hard earned money. Save your money and read a book"
5,Hamez566,"Impulse is a really nice app that helps in just overall brain function. Its a really nice thing to do when you‚Äôre bored and feel like monotony. Its a very nice test for your brain that includes a lot of fun games and things to do. I only use the free version, however I still really enjoy it. It still allows you to do a lot with it. I would definitely recommend if you are hoping to improve some overall areas of brain function in your life or are ever just bored and feel like testing your mind."
5,36withoneontheway,I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I downloaded this app I‚Äôve tried different versions of these apps before and wasn‚Äôt impressed. I do seem to be enjoying this one since I keep coming back to it. The brain games are great they get more difficult as you level up and I‚Äôm often surprised at what I can accomplish or what I can‚Äôt for that matter. Sometimes I think a game will be easy and it‚Äôs not but most of the time I find that with practice and focus everyone can improve in time.
4,mccallea,"I have ADHD and Impulse has been a huge help in a very small amount of time. I love the app, I love the stats, the tests. So awesome. That being said‚Ä¶  Why is family sharing not supported? I paid for a lifetime membership because I played a quick trial on my sister‚Äôs phone. Now I would love to share it with my significant other, who really enjoys it and plays it from my phone.  I would love to share the app without sharing stats and scores. Paying for a lifetime membership should support family sharing. Thank you for the amazing app. But c‚Äômon. You got my money, now let me share it, puh-puh-please. üôè"
4,Sarito o Sary,"I believe this app is entertaining and educational in a sense that it will activate your learning capabilities. For example, memory, critical thinking, consistency, and it will even help you do math without having the calculator as your slave. The game about tracing the figure it my absolute favorite. It‚Äôs challenging but entertaining and helps you figure out different ways to solve a puzzle which in life concludes to figuring out different solutions to a problem. I would give a try and if you see improvement in yourself or your child I would consider purchasing it. Thank you."
3,Witch Ouija,"I actually liked the various brain games they have available, I spent the majority of the time doing word finder and the color separate game. Only complaint would be how many ads there are! I have no problem watching a couple seconds worth of ads, but I only could get through one game before I got something popping up on my screen. Most of the time, you can just turn the wifi off and remove them that way - but these guys are so stingy they won‚Äôt let you use the app without wifi/data üôÑ I won‚Äôt be spending my money on this, but if you like it maybe it‚Äôs worth the investment."
5,Lilly beltz,I have seen this app advertised and I just sorta blew it off but recently I decided what the heck I‚Äôll see what it‚Äôs about and can always delete it if I don‚Äôt like it and unbeknownst to me i actually really enjoy it and I have noticed the improvement I‚Äôm getting better and better each day and I love how it has the daily challenge to show the improvement from day one to day 7 so on and so forth so yes I love this app and recommend it to all thoes who have seen it but haven‚Äôt downloaded it .
5,I‚Äôm.A.Tomboy,Impulse is the best brain game I have ever played. It‚Äôs not frustrating and filled with adds. It‚Äôs not trying to get us to buy something all the time. It also really helps me with what I‚Äôm trying to overcome. I haven‚Äôt spent even an hour on Impulse and I can already see the biggest change in me. Even with playing for hours with other games I have not seen even half of my change. I hope all of you agree and will continue to use it and tell others as soon as you see them!
5,üòä‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòçüôÉüñ§üôÉüòùü§çüôÉ,I‚Äôve quite enjoyed the memory games and the math games. I‚Äôve only used it for two days so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs improving anything but I think it‚Äôs really fun to do and challenges me to think about how to respond in these games. I also enjoy the tests that they offer I thought that was a fun addition to the app. I wish the test that‚Äôs you take would adjust your game recommendations and I wish they had a game recommendation section. Overall I think the app is great graphics and color pallet and all.
2,Nachosbestfriend,"I got this app thinking it would be fun to know my IQ score and maybe even improve it by playing puzzle games. The puzzle games were fun and engaging (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but the tests were a complete waste of my time. Instead of saying beforehand that you had to pay to get the reports, they had me go though all the questions only to tell me afterward that I‚Äôm order to see ANY of the results I had to pay. All you got was just a tiny glimpse of what it was at the top of the screen, without any explanation. I mean, come on guys. You have three different IQ tests at different depths, you could have at least offered the basic one for free, or gave a small explanation of the basic results then have to pay for the more in depth information. Premium isn‚Äôt expensive, per se, but I just have better uses for the twenty bucks or so that it costs.  With the games and puzzles that are unlocked in the free version, this app just isn‚Äôt worth downloading. Only download if you are willing to pay."
1,Asyanurcinar,"The first time you download the app it gives you an option for 3 days free trial, however, if you do a test the results are not showing, they require you pay right that time to see the result. Excuse me but before I subscribe your app I do need to see if you are worth it but you are clearly not giving that option to people which is ridiculous. I immediately unsubscribed from 3 days trial as I‚Äôm not even able to see my test result even though free trail was provided and I deleted the app right after. Do not waste your time if you don‚Äôt wanna pay right when you download the app but if you like to try couple days. As 3 days trial apparently just to stare at the app for free and play the stupid games that available."
5,KBCLN,"I like this app a lot. The games get more difficult the longer you play but it really does stimulate parts of your brain you‚Äôre not really using otherwise, or at least I wasn‚Äôt as a SAHM. I feel like I notice an improvement in my memory, and just overall makes me feel better mentally throughout the day. Makes focusing easier as you‚Äôre more mindful of staying on task when you do these daily. At the least, the IQ and personality tests are always fun. Definitely worth a try."
5,JashaDB,"This is actually a really good game, when I first downloaded this game I expected it to be like one of those fake apps, y‚Äôknow like the ones that put out fake game ads but then when you download the app the game is nothing like what the ad says it is; luckily this app is nothing like that and honestly the TikTok ad (which is where I found this app) doesn‚Äôt do you enough justice to what the game really is, the actually app provides so much more than what the ad says and I love that. Thanks for making this! My new favorite game?!"
5,poopy toaster,"I saw an ad for this a while back and I tend to download a lot of games/apps I find interesting. I struggle with anxiety and figured this game would take my mind of the worries and it did! I play the games they have when I find myself having an anxiety attack or keeping my mind on one thought. You really have to focus and use your brain which is the main goal lol, not only am I reducing my anxiety but i‚Äôm also working my mind! üòÇ Great app and I recommend to anyone looking for an app with mind working games."
5,Mrrrrt,"I‚Äôve noticed some memory and focusing loss over the last few years. This is an easy way to keep my brain active as an adult, and I feel much better about applying myself cognitively, as opposed to just looking at social media. The games are short, fun and sometimes challenging. I feel that this app does a great job with variety, to keep your entire brain stimulated. A little pricey, but the sale helped make the decision to give it a chance much easier. All in all, great thus far."
5,Hutchweez,"I have Multiple Sclerosis & one of the symptoms is a decline in cognition.  I‚Äôve tried several apps with ‚Äúgames‚Äù to try to help alleviate the decline, but none kept me interested (& usually just made me feel more frustrated than accomplished).  But I *look FORWARD* to the daily training on the Impulse app!  It switches up the tests randomly every day, so I‚Äôm not just playing the same games I already KNOW I‚Äôm ‚Äúgood at‚Äù!  And I love that I can play ANY of the games whenever I want (not just in the daily).  This is MY FAVORITE app!!! üëçüèªüëçüèª"
1,try me bio u mean1222222268,"First, there are so many ads I can hardly play one game. Second, most of the ads I‚Äôve received are UNSKIPABLE. I have to continuously close the tab and reopen the app to actually play. The games really would be fun if they wouldn‚Äôt advertise other games and their own free trial every time I load into the app. It‚Äôs very irritating not for just me but for others. A lot of the good reviews are covering up the flaws about this app. It‚Äôs very upsetting because I was hoping for a game that actually kept its word. The ad I‚Äôd seen that made me want to play this wasn‚Äôt even an activity present in the app. Be real, this game needs a lot of work. Stop trying to steal peoples money and maybe people would download it and keep playing."
5,MissMalachite,"I enjoy this app so far. I like the different games they offer to not only challenge your brain and keep you sharp, but also to help unwind your mind. I personally love that I can shut down all my thoughts and overwhelms of the day and just focus on the games they provide you. I also like the personality quizzes and different types of tests they give you. A fun way to get some insight into your mind and personality, why you are the way you are, and how to work on personal growth."
5,Bamcar1,"I have been enjoying Impuse game which is a fun way to keep my brain active and was disappointed that it logged me out recently when I went into the game.  I sent a request for help to see if there was a way to log back in and get my progress restored so that I was not starting over at level 1. I was very pleased to receive a quick response to help me restore my progress. Today I was successfully able to restore my progress. Great game, great support!"
5,ru ke√Øn,"I‚Äôve incorporated doing the daily puzzles into my morning routine as I‚Äôm waking up and having coffee - it‚Äôs a fun way to get my brain into gear for the day, similar to how it‚Äôs helpful to stretch and warm-up the muscles before a more intense exercise. Keeping with the sports analogy, playing the games at the end of the day is a great way to ‚Äúcool-down‚Äù, i.e. relax and unwind. If doing this stuff is supposed to improve my mental sharpness, that‚Äôs an added benefit, but mainly I enjoy the reward of solving puzzles and challenging myself for its own sake."
5,Dilllyyy,"This is an awesome app for anybody who likes to test their mental speed and intelligence. It comes with many games that cater to any weaknesses you may have. It also has multiple IQ and personality tests as a bonus to see where you rank. Although the IQ test isn‚Äôt clinical standard, it‚Äôs a good benchmark and shows you where you rank amongst other people your age who have taken it. I like the fact that the games are fun and interactive but you can tell that they‚Äôre testing specific skills that are useful in day to day life!"
5,nathanrosas18,"I realized I‚Äôve have always been attracted to more intelligent apps. I‚Äôve always been a nerd and will most likely always be one. Impulse helps to ground my mind in the wake of my busy schedule not including my 2 kids under 5. Impulse reminds me when I‚Äôm doing well and when I‚Äôm not doing well. And I look at the days Im doing well very closely to find out why I‚Äôm not doing well. This way I can be more consistent and flourish to new heights I could only dream of. Thank you, for creating a very well rounded app for people like me."
5,Tommiegirl75,I have been on a learning journey for a few years well honestly my whole life. But very recently I‚Äôve been feeling mental fog even amidst my my learning endeavors. I‚Äôm new to Impulse and right from the beginning these games have started to let me navigate through the fog to my eventual goal of stars and moonlight (I‚Äôm a night person). The app does this in clever ways to wake my foggy brain up and improve my cognitive abilities. Try it out for yourself; I think it‚Äôs worth the price of admission so to speak.
5,treevillage,"For one: I will press on something and it will not register that I pressed it. Two: the levels get insanely difficult and near impossible to do. Why isn‚Äôt there a colorblind option for sort the trash? How are people supposed to sort them so quickly if they can‚Äôt see the color difference as well and can‚Äôt tell what material it is? Match the pair, treasure hunt, and the other focus and working memory games are the bane of my existence"
2,wasabipea13,"First off, I have no problem paying for an app that I‚Äôll use. With that said, I downloaded the Impulse app and was still experimenting during my 3-day trial period when I was sent a discounted rate offer. Figured the rate would be applied after my 3-day trial ended (so I‚Äôd have some time to figure out if I‚Äôd use it) so I accepted the offer and was charged immediately. Didn‚Äôt feel like groveling to Apple for a refund so I‚Äôm out 29 bucks for something I‚Äôm not using. I might contact Apple anyway because yea I‚Äôm annoyed. Just buyer beware on that.  Gave it two stars because I guess it‚Äôs a decent time waster if you have the time, which I don‚Äôt."
4,pamelilla816,I have no issue it was just the sort by color one I didn‚Äôt like at first and got one wrong because I thought I had to drag it into the right trash not click on the trash so that‚Äôs why I got it wrong but other to that I have no issue with it. I do like it. And look  I understand the creator charges because they need money but if this is to improve someone‚Äôs memory and help them thru what they‚Äôve been through it should be free because you never know if what they‚Äôve been through has caused them to not be able to work.
5,designhomeexplayer,"I have been struggling with post partum anxiety and found a big difference since using this app‚Ä¶ I feel so much better, I sleep better, and starting to feel like myself again. I also play these games instead of doom scrolling on social media which I think was contributing to my anxiety. Love the puzzles and bonus levels! Only feedback I have is would like more bonus levels and the option to only play the bonus levels in the puzzle section."
5,hollyvrobinson,I really enjoy this app. I immediately downloaded after reading reviews. I ended up subscribing after playing a couple games. I work in a high pace environment and sometimes just need a distraction that causes me to focus on something else and this app is just the right thing! I‚Äôve given myself a goal to complete 5 minutes worth of games each day and it‚Äôs already helped me center myself during stressful days by allowing me to focus on the game. I‚Äôm really happy I gave it a try.
5,Furrybooger,"I don‚Äôt usually review apps, but this one is different. Recently, I haven‚Äôt been able to read or stimulate my brain as much as I‚Äôd like to. I clicked on the ad for this app by accident and I ended up enjoying the games. The games are really fun and they allow me to think harder as I progress. Not only does this provide enjoyment, but it‚Äôs sharpening my ability to think and recall what task I‚Äôm in the process of doing. For any of you who want an enjoyable and stimulating game, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this one to anyone."
5,HappySunflower1!,"I have only been using this app for a few days, but it really has allowed me to get to my own knowledge better. The games are really fun, yet effective.    I did have some trouble with a few of the games, but I probably just didn‚Äôt understand the directions correctly.    The quiz‚Äôs that are available are awesome, as well. They had helped me gain a better understanding of what goes on in my head.    Other than that, this app is amazing and had me starting my day feeling good.    Now take in mind I have the free version of this app, yet it still allows you just as much availability than the yearly/weekly version does. There is a free trial which I think is great for those who want to try out the app without having to pay if they don‚Äôt like it.    I strongly recommend this app if you are looking for something to stretch your knowledge!!!"
3,Dvall027,"Once you've made it past the pay walls, the app is pretty decent, and games are entertaining. But after a while you begin to notice lots a bugs and issue that could be fixed. I've reported several bugs and issues in the apps like finishing levels and not receiving credit for them, or games that tell you are are out of moves being incorrect, it actually not leading you to a dead end. All things I've left as feedback but honestly don't expect the developers to ever look at. They made a cash cow, and likely don't care to fix anything."
1,Ed 4568928400,"I impulsively downloaded this after being clickbaited by their own ad on IG. It was an info graph showing different ADHD subtypes based on taking their test. It‚Äôs an expensive app subscription, so I signed up for the free trial. Then I spent my valuable time and energy taking the test. At the end they REQUIRE YOU TO PAY to see the test result.  The company boasts about how many millions of users they have, yet are so profit oriented (aka greedy) that they try to pull every trick to get your money. Now I‚Äôm spending even more of my time and energy writing this in hopes to save you from wasting your time and money with this ironically named Impulse app. There are plenty of free and/or better resources for people who want to improve their brains or ADHD."
5,kayne carlson,"I‚Äôve enjoyed every little game that this app has as ‚Äútraining‚Äù. It‚Äôs severely great training for the brain because as you train your brain, you get to keep it more so stress free because the ‚Äútraining‚Äù is just calm and relatively easy games. Highly recommend this app.   All of this coming from a man who died twice in under 6 months was put in a coma and started over from the mental age of zero. My brain is back workin as it should and that‚Äôs because of games like this."
5,Tipstein,"Exactly the kind of exercises I was looking for!  After reading the reviews, I‚Äôm glad I dove right in and skipped having to manage through the ads.  Being able to fly though all kinds of activities that help improve focus, attention, memory, while minimizing distraction is exactly why I got the app.  Even more, I love how each game/puzzle/activity highlights what I‚Äôm working on/improving.  Overall, this is such a fun productive time killer‚Ä¶.rare to find one with this much variety and challenge."
3,irosnhdfjjjdm,"The games are fun and I feel like they are good for brain exercise but you will literally be asked to buy a subscription dozens of times as there are paywalls everywhere. The worst is that if you take a test, they will not tell you you have to pay for the results until you are done. That to me is downright cruel. Also, you will watch tons of ads. I wish they would make free membership more enjoyable as I am fine it‚Äôs limited use and watching ads, but I don‚Äôt understand why the don‚Äôt just make you pay from the start if they want your money so bad."
5,ghfgrbbgbv,"Love this it‚Äôs one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. It gives you three different games to help your brain It‚Äôs so good. It took me so short of a time to learn how to work this app and it took me about like 14 seconds to learn how to do this app and it was so good that I would recommend it to anyone in the world like I would, I can‚Äôt even say anything I would recommend it to anyone in this world right now. I can‚Äôt say anything bad about it because it‚Äôs one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever use to shop in my brain."
3,Mel-batoast77,"Ok so maybe the app deserves a bit more than 3 stars. But I have a complaint. The crossword puzzle game is not challenging enough. They give very elementary words, and it happens over and over again, 3 and 4 letter words all the way up to Level 61, and many repeated each game. How does that help my brain? No, most of the larger words I think of are not on the puzzle, so even though I get points for them, it‚Äôs just frustrating to have an app that is mostly catered more to adults (and/or teens) to be using such low-level vocabulary 60 levels in. Come on guys. You can do better."
5,shears1234,"It is worth every penny! The games are fun and challenging. It is definitely sharpened my brain, even lowering anxiety. This review actually sounds like a paid review or a bit review, I know. But it‚Äôs not. This app is actually, truly that helpful. If you have brain fog, anxiety, or trouble remembering things, USE THIS APP. Your brain will absolutely improve. I especially love the encouragement it gives if I don‚Äôt do well on a challenge. The better you get at challenges, the harder they get, keeping you sharp! Five stars."
5,Yoni Rae,"Dementia runs in my family - both on the maternal and paternal side - so I‚Äôm always looking for ways to keep my mind sharp. I heard about Impulse and decided to give it a try. I‚Äôm so very glad I did! The games (exercises) are fun to play, more challenging the further you go along and short enough to where you‚Äôre not easily bored. I‚Äôve recommended this app to several friends and family members. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and engaging way to test your cognitive skills on a daily basis, download Impulse!"
3,ShanaDF,"I am on 110 day streak with the daily training. So safe to say I‚Äôve been at it long enough to give this feedback. While most of the training games are good and even fun, there are some boring ones (pass the ball, arrows direction). While an app having a few boring games is to be expected, there aren‚Äôt enough total games in rotation to keep me wanting to come back.    Would love to see at least 2-3x more games added for the daily workouts. Otherwise this isn‚Äôt worth paying for a year subscription because you‚Äôll be bored within a couple of months."
5,1Matthew2,"I was looking to distract my inward ego from rambling on stressing me out over quite literally nothing.   These games allow me to move past thoughts and allow them time to cool down while distracting me.   I‚Äôve also been reading, journaling, going to therapy, working out, and trying to be more in touch with how the mind works and being present. There‚Äôs not always time to sit down and meditate so this app is my next level of simple distraction but also allowing me to continually stretch my brain."
3,The.rapist.Shane,"Look, it‚Äôs actually one of the better or best brain training apps. Fun, user friendly, extremely informative, content other apps lack. This would be 5 stars but I was under the impression that this was free, NOPE! Too bad though I like it. Especially how in-depth the information provided is, such as how the specific parts of the brain & their function. Also enjoyed how I was shown the % of ‚Äúmy peers‚Äù which I scored higher than after each activity/game.  Again too bad I was tricked into downloading it. Though it may be worth purchasing, if it were as one time fee, NOT A DANG SUBSCRIPTION!!!!"
5,nadiiamiller,"It‚Äôs an awesome app with regular updates and you can do a one time forever purchase it‚Äôs incredible how well they keep up their product. Just excellent.  I love the games, they are not just good for your brain, they are fun and entertaining, I tried a few apps and this one is best, been using it for more than a year now. I have 0 complaints. This app is one of my valued possessions that is absolutely totally worth the money."
4,just a teen gal,"I love this app i bought a year subscription because I use it so much. Only complaint is on the candy sort game if you add a tube to solve, it shows up as grey or not completed. Then when you reopen the app, it will take you to the grey levels even if you‚Äôre hundreds of levels past. And if you go to complete that grey level, it doesn‚Äôt take you to the next grey level, it will just take you to the next level even if you completed it and it‚Äôs too much scrolling"
1,ThisGuyThatEats,"The app offers you a free trial that will convert to a paid subscription at the end of 3 days. However, during this ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù you are able to take tests, but not read the results of the tests WITHOUT PAYING. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense, since I‚Äôm already subscribed. Yes, my payment is deferred, but the app forced me to subscribe to take the tests‚Ä¶ a subscription that will auto-charge me at the end of my ‚Äúfree trial.‚Äù So, essentially, they lure you into a subscription you must cancel with 0 benefit. You can take the tests, but not see the results. Cool. Kind of scummy if you ask me. Now I have to take time out of my day cancelling the useless trial subscription (that will charge me if I don‚Äôt) without ever having gotten to try the app."
5,krisha1974,this is a fine game or to put it more bluntly games. I am believing that there are more than one game due to the fact that our mind needs several different ideas at bedtime for your mind to have several different items or ideas to think so your mind does not get stuck on just one thing so that idea does not get stuck and keeps us up at night. I believe that is the excellence of this app. Really Wise Even if at first you do not understand this.
5,iProjectSaturn,"Impulsive is a pretty fun brain training game that most of the time I don‚Äôt realize is a brain training game. Most of the mini games are pretty challenging but make you really think(my personal favorite being the 1 line game.) mini flex, but I took an iq test and it said it was 125 which I'm pretty happy about seeing as I‚Äôm still relatively young compared to others with that iq. Overall, I really like the game and I recommend it to anyone who has too much free time and wastes it on social media."
5,Edana-4476,I‚Äôm one of those people that rarely leaves reviews and I never ever purchase anything. But I bought this game and I‚Äôm glad I did. My father died from dementia and keeping my brain as sharp as possible is important. This is the most detailed and professional app I‚Äôve ever seen. You‚Äôll never get bored! They update it to keep it going with more added games.  P.s please bring back the original colors for candy sort. The colorblind option was a lifesaver but the new colors are very hard to recognize
5,ChiefKatyKat,"I just started using this app a couple days ago and has been great so far!   Trying to work in a simple and attainable way to work my brain out a bit more.    The games are fun and I love the way you can customize your goals.   I have been doing 10 minutes a day which I find to be achieve able but there are others options with 20 minutes a day or even 5.   I like the additional puzzles, tests and games also.   Super cool and I‚Äôm trying to convince my husband to get it."
5,Jcowen0912,"Not only has it improved some of my executive functioning skills, including my working memory and attention, but I also find it to be extremely addictive, and I look forward to it every day. there‚Äôs one game called fresh item I believe, in which they add a new item of clothing and you have to decide if it‚Äôs new or not and I‚Äôve literally gone from horrible to 100% every time. So that skill has completely improved. it‚Äôs worth your time."
5,unique brim,these games are fun to play easy to get sucked into and there‚Äôs is a variety of games to choose from the word guess game was soooo difficult but I was persistent and ended up getting the hang of it ! I recommend this app bc it‚Äôs a great way to get that daily brain exercise! The game will even give u a personalized set of daily brain teasers‚Ä¶(I am not consistent enough to actually make it apart of my schedule)  but there is a reminder option u can customize to any set time to remind you !
1,Morganikara,"I downloaded this app thinking it would be pretty cool to train my brain, but alas the free 3-day trial doesn‚Äôt allow you to access any of the really cool features. Are you so unsure of the value of this app that you must hook people into giving you money before allowing access? That perspective isn‚Äôt for me. Deleting.  UPDATE:  Received a response from developer asking for suggestions to improve this app.   I would think my suggestion was more than obvious in my original review.   As usual, the response isn‚Äôt helpful, rather it is merely lip service so they can show they do respond to feedback in a timely manner.   Some response is good, but responses should be evaluated for relevance and quality as well as timeliness!"
2,itsdyeana,I‚Äôve only had the app for a few days and only got it because I had a gift card. I bought the year membership but I‚Äôve yet to see if it‚Äôll be worth it to pay for that long since I‚Äôve only had it for about 5 days. So far though it‚Äôs been good and I think I may redeem next year (we‚Äôll see). There‚Äôs a variety of tests and apps that seem worth it enough.  Update: the touch sensitivity is weird and unresponsive sometimes. I‚Äôll be dragging my finger across the screen and the touch won‚Äôt register. It‚Äôs frustrating because it‚Äôll make me restart sometimes. I‚Äôm going to check my phone settings but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what it is.
5,lisamaxout,The fact that I won a discounted rate to continue the services for a year for only $.99 cents was AMAZING! I thank God for this Mental Game because it truly helped me during a time where I needed it the most! It helps me to stay focused and pay great attention to detail. It helps with your math skills and really improved my speech. I can take the things I learned from this game and use it in real life situations without even realizing it. So thank you to the creators of this fun and fulfilling game.
3,Bdnsnsns,I like the app and the games. I really just likes the games and haven‚Äôt bothered with anything else. Soooo many ads. For the pop-up to pay $4.99 to remove ads and thought it was a good deal. Only to find out it was just for that one group. I wouldn‚Äôt have paid if I knew that. Thought it was for the whole app. There are a lot of levels but I would have at minimum chosen a different game to pay for. Now I have to play Connect the dots (which is only 300 levels). I would have chosen at least one with more levels and that I enjoyed more.
5,Southern Texas Carolina,"I added Impulse to my daily schedule to keep my brain sharp. The brain is a muscle and like our bodies we need to exercise it. The way I do it is by the practice techniques provided in this app. Try drinking more water as well so you can keep your muscle hydrated. In doing so, you‚Äôll notice the change and you‚Äôll feel the power and potential you have by trying this app and drinking a little more water. üí™üèªüéì‚ú®üôåüèª. Download the app. You won‚Äôt regret it. -SouthernTexasCarolina"
5,Enzerubebitakkun,I like how straightforward these games are! They don‚Äôt feel as stressful as other brain training games - I think it might be because there isn‚Äôt an intense timer countdown like others have.  It‚Äôs super fun and I can feel my brain muscles getting stretched!  If you do the free route - there are little ads that play but they‚Äôre SHORT so it‚Äôs not too disrupting and I‚Äôm happy to support the devs that way :) I like these games much better than the Lumosity games I used to pay for.
4,Nidhikalaria,"I was feeling focused and less distracted from my day to day thoughts due to this game so I am grateful to have come across this and it was quite fun to play but it can be free for users instead of having it paid for fun, as I sensed the free version was purposely made very easy to force the users to buy the paid version to enjoy the real fun of this game.  Thought of sharing my personal insight on this experience but at the end I am no one to tell you how to run your app so thanks for giving me the little fun I had in the free version üôèüèº‚úåüèª"
3,CareBear05021988,"YOU GUYS... you cannot just delete an app that you have subscribed to and think it goes away... you have to actually go to subscriptions and cancel the subscription before the free trial period ends if that‚Äôs what you choose to do.   Anyway I downloaded this for the tower of Hanoi game. My complaint is that at level 14, it doesn‚Äôt move quickly when you tap it and instead it auto moves and you have to wait almost a minute to move the ring from one spot to another. This doesn‚Äôt make sense with a timed game. I would like to get to level 30 but can‚Äôt if it‚Äôs gonna be this slow. Is it a glitch?"
5,recmond,"I have recently been trying to improve the function and health of my brain. After years of trauma and drug/alcohol abuse, I‚Äôve been having a hard time having mental clarity. My mind doesn‚Äôt work the way it used to but this app has already been helping a lot! I can physically feel my brain feel better as I do the exorcises. Using this app along with therapy, reading, eating healthy, being physically active and living a sober life has been changing my life for the best!"
2,TaurusMoon91,"I absolutely love this app, these are the types of games I most enjoy. However, ever since I upgraded to the pro version I have to play some levels of candy sort multiple times for it to truly save it as being done. There seems to be no reasoning behind it either as it has nothing to do with if I use a power up or not. So if I play and beat multiple levels in a session, next time I go to play random levels throughout that previous session will be undone and I will have to do them again. You can‚Äôt skip levels so I‚Äôm not even sure how this glitch is possible but it‚Äôs certainly frustrating."
5,The Bynum,"I really like this app. I like that explains the games and why they created them. They are simultaneously simultaneously challenging. After each game it shows how you did in conjunction with others who played the same game.  Set up is super easy and very customizable to the user. I‚Äôm going to purchase it for my phone for life instead of a monthly subscription. And having a brain injury myself, this is exactly what I need to help train my brain and keep it strong."
2,Dc?,"I did the trial, games were fun so I paid for a week subscription.  I didn‚Äôt play enough to warrant continuing the subscription so I cancelled after the week. OMG the ads were nonstop.  Some of the ads have very adult themes which is odd for an app with a 4+ age rating (parents beware).  You can play a game that takes 15 seconds then have to wait through a 30 second ad for the next game.  Most sessions are 3 games long, so you have about 90 seconds of ads for 45 seconds to a minute of gameplay.  It became so frustrating I finally gave up.  Not worth the overall cost in my opinion for a phone game."
4,andooley,"As with most brain training apps that charge for a subscription, this one is ad-filled without payment. I will say though...that the app's ""guide"" WILL let you know how to fast forward thru the ad to make it as time efficient as possible. Personally, still running app for free, I appreciate the stats offered after each game- telling you how well you do in comparison to peers. Other tests/quizzes are also offered; however, you don't get an official report or analysis of your scores unless you opt in for payment"
1,Olsotm0813,It‚Äôs such a scam. I love puzzle games and saw an add for this so I figured I‚Äôd give it a try.  It says 3 days free trial. It locked up in a day and started charging me. Not only does it automatically charge the $9.99 but there‚Äôs nothing in app to stop it. I deleted the app and it kept trying to charge me. It also charges on a weekly basis. $9.99 but there‚Äôs an option for $9.99 a month also. It defaults to charging you every week for the same amount it would be a month. It‚Äôs very deceptive and a scam. I can‚Äôt believe Apple would let this happen. Thankfully I had this on a reloadable card. If not they would of easily gotten the $9.99 a week for a few weeks before I noticed. Don‚Äôt trust them with your info and don‚Äôt waste your time on this.
1,Mehdi.Y,"They let you download it for free, but implicitly activate the subscription option. If you do not explicitly turn it off in a short time they will charge you without any further notification. In their terms of service, they mention an unsubscribe button in their website which I could never found (perhaps it doesn‚Äôt exist), so the only possible option is to send an email to unsubscribe you! I did send an email requesting to be unsubscribed and refund a few hours after I realized they have charged me without my consent, but no response yet!  Please report this to Apple Support, every app must keep it clear and clean otherwise it is a scam!"
5,UfzmGkgGkvkslhxzlhzlzlzzhlb,"l just downloaded and I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied. The cost is like $20 for a whole year worth of training, personalized tests, and puzzles. It‚Äôs definitely worth the money because it‚Äôs interactive, kid friendly, has in tests which has been my favorite so far. the only things i‚Äôm worried about is after finishing the thousands upon thousands of puzzles i hope i‚Äôm still able to find other things to do in the app but that would take years"
5,J. Simpleton,"I have spent at least 5 minutes a day on impulse every day for the last 6 months, and I can honestly say the short games have helped to keep my mind sharp and quick. The games are simple exercises and not very difficult at all, but when done consistently over a period of time the results will show. Definitely worth it and I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to improve their thinking and mental processing speed."
2,Dorksterrr,"The free trial is far from free. In the ten minutes I used the app I was bombarded with three different attempts to get me to ‚Äúpay now.‚Äù You get a sneak peak of your results, with a lengthy scheme to get you to fork over a one-time payment of $28. Don‚Äôt worry, though. This is a .92% (92%??) discount. The archetype test has some grammatical errors, repeat questions, and is for entertainment purposes only (I‚Äôm fine with that). I didn‚Äôt expect it to be standardized, norm-referenced caliber tests. But for 7 bucks A WEEK I‚Äôd want better than click bait with ads and other nonsense. Bottom line: it‚Äôs a free trial that‚Äôs not free and purely click bait. Thankfully, Apple makes subscription canceling easy."
3,Romper2.0,"Excellent games that were very enjoyable to play! Fun for my brain and good for so many reasons. But I deleted the app. Every 30 seconds an add would play. After I finished one round of a game or exercise, an add would show up. I found myself getting extremely frustrated and very little benefit from the game/exercise. I was spending more time watching adds than participating in the app.   I get the app needs to make money‚Ä¶but there are plenty of other free versions that allow for longer play inbetween adds. I‚Äôve never used an app that played so many adds!"
4,BAJDJEBXBSJSJX,"It was good but it killed my braincell from trying to figure out how to put the blocks in number order. My head was smoking like Patrick‚Äôs head when he thinks. I recommend this app if yu want to slowly kill your braincells and then rebuild them bigger, better, and stronger but have a head the size of a melon. I really liked how good this app kills braincells. Also my super happy grandma died trying to help. And since I was highly addicted to the game I did not eat for 4 days but I did get a good grade on one of my tests. I feel like this is one of those mind control apps tbh."
5,Chicks That Print,"When you hear the word IQ, you can‚Äôt help but wonder right? I was impressed with the variety of tests, the levels of accomplishments, and the ease of choosing what appeals to you. My husband and I actually were competing which was good for some laughs and bragging rights. I am also going to share with a family member that uses mental games to help keep her mind active as she ages. I‚Äôm impressed and highly recommend you give it a try - they offer a 3 day trial free too!"
5,Angel_10213819001456!,"So I am very terrible at math and have tried different apps to help me improve but nothing really worked and I‚Äôm the type of person when I am not interested in something I‚Äôm NOT into it like there is no effort I basically don‚Äôt give a crap. This app has different games that helps you improve your thinking, math, memory skills and the games that it proves is fun and something‚Äôs frustrating but I am willing to accept the challenge. Download this app now!"
5,Brittsta143,"Very fun and intriguing games to sharpen your mind. Have honestly been looking for something like this for years just couldn‚Äôt think of a way to word exactly what I was looking for aside from ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù lol. Seriously contemplating on doing the yearly version if it happens to pop up again as an offer lol DOWNLOAD IT & do the 3 day trial :) you won‚Äôt be disappointed, wish trial was longer but I know that‚Äôs exactly how they get ya to go premium haha it‚Äôs Awesome just get it !"
5,Skyylarr94,"I downloaded this app when I was having really bad anxiety. Nothing I could do would help my anxiety so I knew I needed a distraction. I downloaded this app and it immediately became one of my favorite apps. It‚Äôs fun, it has SO MANY LEVELS!!! And it has a variety of games, tests, puzzles, etc. and I have never left a review on an app before, but this one is legit so good that I knew I had to leave a review. I love it! As someone who deals with ADHD & anxiety, this is the perfect app and it‚Äôs beneficial in a way as well!"
2,LILLLLLLLLLYYYYY,"I‚Äôve had this app for a little while, and the games are fun, but the things like quizzes and other features seem really fun until you try to get your results. It won‚Äôt tell you your results until you pay them a given amount. I wish they would just lock the quizzes and other features so you don‚Äôt go through all the effort of going through the quiz just to have it ask you to pay. I know they have to make money somehow but it seems a bit deceptive. I know not many people may see this, but I hope it helps someone not to waste their time with this feature like I did."
1,Dhothaka,"I updated the app and when I tried to open it, it got stuck in the loading screen (logo). I‚Äôm using iPhone 15 Pro Max on iOS 17.4.1. Tried quitting the app and restating and restarting the phone. Could fix the issue. Since the app didn‚Äôt load after trying several times I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Once I did that, my purchases got restored, however, all my progress was gone and now I have to start from the beginning. I had completed most of the levels in many games in the past few months. This is extremely annoying and I have to repeat everything from the beginning again. Is there a way to restore my progress??"
5,Xky3,I‚Äôve tried other brain games and they either focus too much on academic topics like math or they don‚Äôt give you the flexibility to keep progressing in areas you prefer. Impulse runs smooth and feels great playing. It makes me want to improve by balancing the feeling of enjoyment while still challenging your brain. Other programs like this eventually make you feel like your working too hard without enough reward.
5,JchsNathan,"Game is awesome and I‚Äôd like to purchase the lifetime offer. But it only appears once during the the initial setup, before I had a chance to try the game out. I‚Äôm not going to drop that kinda money prior to trying it. Now that I have I‚Äôm unable to find the offer anywhere. It‚Äôs not available under iPhone subscriptions menu. Nor can I access it through the app. Please advise how I can purchase the special offer."
5,Kkwil,Saw an ad for this app on Facebook. I enjoy puzzles and I like that there is so much you can chose from. You‚Äôre not forced to do one or two things until you unlock something or pay something. The price per year is very reasonable too in my opinion. The games are not overwhelming. Just the right amount of time and challenge to make you feel satisfied when you beat a level. Looking forward to using this app more.
5,wast your battery,"In my opinion, I think you should definitely get this app. When I played it I thought I was going to play it for about 2 days and then just quit, but I‚Äôve been playing for a long time now. The games are fun to me, and I feel accomplished once I finish the games. One thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that they don‚Äôt have a lot of free games, that‚Äôs what I just only go on there to do my daily training, but overall this game is a good game. Definitely recommend."
5,DMW9283,"Impulse has countless number of different games that challenge your eyesight, mental acuity, innovation thinking, and it challenges the brain which I believe will help with mental disease prevention. One of the best features is that you don‚Äôt need to be connected to the internet. You can play a quick game literally anywhere you are. I highly recommend Impulse if you don‚Äôt have patience to sit for long games or that drag you into some deep story."
5,toongsup,"I can't say this app is affecting my brain on such level or transforming it, but I can say that these games help break or interrupt my patterns. Whether that is doomscrolling or that one addictive game that consumes all of my time (and oftentimes energy because I'm getting worked up over the poor online behavior), this is a nice break from my daily phone routine and habits that no longer serve. I think that in addition to all the brain benefits makes this app top notch."
5,miss keva,I took a course from the creator in Mindvalley and it changed my life! I couldn‚Äôt afford the app before I‚Äôm so excited it‚Äôs on sale. I‚Äôm so excited about this. I‚Äôm recovering from a severe traumatic brain injury. I was run over by a truck in November 2020 lucky me I survived with no broken bones and only a severe traumatic brain injury. I am recovering well and have refused drugs and listening to the creator of this programs. Wisdom has changed my life sending you love and gratitude.
1,AlexMarie522,"Update after developer response: As I indicated in my original review, I was charged immediately after selecting the free trial. This was not a case of me not cancelling in time. I also already contacted the developer at the email address given. I emailed them on the day I was charged for the free trial and have never received a response. If I could give zero stars, I would!    Original Review: I downloaded the app and selected a free trial because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like it or not. I immediately got a confirmation of purchase and a receipt for $6.99 from the App Store‚Ä¶ so much for a free trial! Cancelled and am attempting to get a refund. This is ridiculous and I certainly won‚Äôt be a subscriber after this."
4,New!! Twist on Ancient Game,I am new to Impulse.  It is humbling in some respects.  I thought I would be better with some things but once results are explained the results make sense. I am 62 years old and have Alzheimer‚Äôs in my family so I am concerned about my future. I know training my brain can only be beneficial. I know it‚Äôs recommended to use your brain or lose. This program certainly is tapping into areas I haven‚Äôt used in a while. I can tell the math isn‚Äôt as fast to me as it used to be so I am eager to continue and see how I improve. Thank you!
5,jdujhdhju,They advertise is really good and it helps you a lot. I really think they make you feel good that you accomplished something and your getting better at it each day you do it. You should at least check it out if you don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine but I do. They also give you some lessons if you need help with it and it‚Äôs just fun getting to do games but still learning. This is a really good app yes you may have to pay but I don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs still very fun.
5,Chibitoru-san,"I‚Äôve been struggling with mental arithmetic and processing since leaving college, and have needed to practice to be more effective at my job. This app is both fun, engaging and challenging. The puzzles are unique, and the math challenges are varied in style to use different styles of learning and practicing. I don‚Äôt really like subscriptions, so I just decided to buy the game wholesale at the full price, which is a bit expensive. But to me, worth it because I intend to keep it to practice loving to learn again."
5,10000000 out of 10000000,"As a high school who struggles to focus in class, I‚Äôve found that after using this app I‚Äôve been able to focus better, my memory has improved and I‚Äôve also had reduced head aches. Not only does the app improve only take a couple minutes a day with incredible outcome, they‚Äôve also got fun brain games and puzzles that I‚Äôve struggled with and also find fun and challenging. I strongly suggest downloading for anyone it‚Äôs fun and relaxing."
5,Pixie platinum,"As I have gotten older and having had children, my memory and mental awareness has began to decline. I have tried other apps to keep my mind sharpe but none have kept my interest like impulse. And for the price it‚Äôs hard to say no to. It‚Äôs only a few minutes a day and you can pick the level of commitment. So far so good and I actually enjoy doing the tests and puzzles. Plus it‚Äôs very informative. I have already recommended this app to friends."
5,LadyPooh2018,"I highly recommend this app for brain exercises. It not only helps in retaining information, improving memory, and enhancing logical order but also provides a report of your strengths and weaknesses. This feature allows you to concentrate and practice on areas that need development and improvement. This app is suitable for both adults and teens alike. I would highly recommend this app because of its simplicity and effectiveness."
5,Rick-Raft,"""I'm not one to like an app after seeing it is through a payed service"" were my first thoughts, but seeing my spending and that what I usually buy serves me no purpose, I had to give a game that promised improvement for my mind a try! I was not disappointed at all! I've introduced people who could benefit from this type of activity and seeing their smiles as they solve the puzzles and how they become alive as they solve it moves my heart!"
3,locallapdog,"As the title says i believe this app has a lot of things going for it, i loved the way it was set up and i enjoyed most of the tests. i felt like i was learning a decent amount of myself. however, as most of the world now at days, i saw an ad for this app on tiktok and the test that was shown wasn‚Äôt even on the app. i ended up getting a subscription in a means to attempt to see if new tests would be unlocked and maybe i could take the one that peaked my interest, which was in the ad, but to no avail. i do enjoy the app, but i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be keeping it."
5,Rebecca Joyner,"I am a first time impulse user and I have to say it is the most AMAZING app so far!!! it has really helped me discover some things about myself that I didn‚Äôt even know. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and taking these tests and doing these exercises, strengthen my brain to a level I never knew existed, and knowing which personality you are, your intellectual type, and how to help with your ADHD, anxiety and depression have been some amazing tools! Thank you Impulse, and keep up the good work!"
1,Charleygrl,"Im not sure how this has so many high reviews. They want you to pay üí∞ for everything from a subscription to paying a one time fee to view my test results. Within 5 minutes they asked for my money in 5 different times for various reasons! Only download if you want to pay money. Even with a 3 day free trial you can take tests or games but must still pay to view results. How can I get on the list of people they bribe for a 5‚≠êÔ∏è review??  It‚Äôs misleading marketing to advertise a 3-day free trial where you think you‚Äôre getting a trail of the paid features, when really it‚Äôs a trial of the free features (so why call it a trial at all?).   Completely Misleading."
5,kaelaconorseanroxx,"in my however many years as an apple user this is the second app i‚Äôve ever paid for (behind minecraft, but 2013 was a strange time) and I LOVE IT!!!!!! upon opening the app for my free trial i was introduced to Candy Sort, otherwise known as the best game i have ever played in all of my life. i haven‚Äôt actually done much on impulse with the other games and quizzes, but candy sort has consumed my life. i was born to sort candy into little test tubes. THIS APP IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
5,i am just mad,"I‚Äôm  60 yr. Old woman. I have noticed my thinking, problem solving and recall have gotten  a lot  slower. I used the APP a while back and in a short time I was able to see improvement. The only problem is I thought everything was OK so I stopped using it and all my brain activities or deficiencies slowly came back. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to keep their minds and brains sharp  try this APP for a week and see for yourself."
5,DreamGiantEnterprises,"I‚Äôve had a blast adding this app into my daily routine. I always seem to struggle finding something that I can get engaged in and not lose focus, while still keeping my mind sharp. I tried it for free to start, and have since purchased the pro version after a month‚Äôs use. I definitely think it‚Äôs worth the value, and you should give it a try if you want a good brain trainer that you look forward to playing each day!"
5,Scarlet1979,"I‚Äôm shamelessly starting off with a ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said joke,‚Äù but really, there are so many different games, challenges, & self-exploration tests such as IQ and personality, it‚Äôs a little mind boggling. I‚Äôve been using it several times a day for about a week and I haven‚Äôt tried everything within it yet. I feel like I can probably delete all my other puzzle games without regret.   I paid $40 for a lifetime subscription, and I feel it was totally worth it."
5,CookieMonZsteR,I love the test it‚Äôs encouraging to see and test your speed and ability to find out your score in each category. I strive to improve on my own time and that‚Äôs wonderful to feel not pressured to hurry up and get done with the one your doing to straight away do the next ‚Ä¶ you can finish the one your own leave the app and come back to see if it‚Äôs helping AND IT DOES!‚Ä¶ although you do get gentle nudges every now n then to remind you to come play !! Thanks Mary
5,waltuhwite,"I started playing this game about a week ago, and I‚Äôm Already noticing differences. When I woke up today I saw multiple complex math equations floating around my head. Paying no attention to it went down stairs and subconscious made a very well balanced breakfast. Finally when went to the bathroom I looked into the mirror and realized my cranium had grown too twice its original size. I fear that if I continue to play this game I may become to smart for the world to handle."
5,mikepm84,I‚Äôm 39 and have a 4th grade education level on paper and I feel like it‚Äôs true after downloading and using this app it has helped me figure out just where my education level is at and also helps me to understand what I need to try to learn more of and as far as I‚Äôm adhd on paper and very much so it‚Äôs true it has helped me learn to focus and stop and think while I‚Äôm working on the things that they provide for me to learn and focus on in this app
5,Ricky1027561,"I don‚Äôt like to spend money on apps, but I went ahead and purchased the lifetime membership for Impusle.  A few summers ago I had played this app and I loved it, and I know it helped with my memory and cognitive ability.  When I finally got my new IPad I decided that it was time to do something for myself, and I am so happy that I have.   Instead of watching TV for hours I will exercise my brain and have a sense of accomplishment! :-)"
3,Jessicaleerose,"I purchased the pro version. As someone with ADHD I wanted to see if it could help as advertised. I took all the tests, did the daily challenges for a couple weeks, and enjoyed some of the games.   What was really frustrating was seeing the advertisements and seeing tests only to go into the app and find that they weren‚Äôt there or results weren‚Äôt what showed on the ads. This was especially true in archetype tests.   It is a decent app, but the puzzles and games I played a lot didn‚Äôt really get more challenging and this test issue seems misleading."
5,panda queen üêº,"I‚Äôve been going through a lot of things in my life and now it kinda feels like when I‚Äôm playing this game it keeps me focused and relaxed. I know this sound so dramatic but I‚Äôm being serious, with every time I‚Äôve been downgraded by others I find peace in listening to music and playing this game. It also really challenges you when you‚Äôre at a harder level. I recommend this game if you just ever want to relax or challenge yourself"
5,V Gilbert,"I‚Äôve only had this app for 2 days and already I‚Äôm enjoying the trainings. I thought it would be fairly boring and repetitive and I would loose interest in it right away, that‚Äôs not what happened though. The challenges are unique enough to keep me engaged making the daily training a pleasure not a chore. If you want to strengthen your brain you should at least give it a chance I think you‚Äôll like it too."
5,Action lover 1054,"The app obviously contains ads that you have to watch if you don‚Äôt pay a certain subscription or price, but that‚Äôs about every single app nowadays. But you know what, that‚Äôs ok with me. I actually look forward to playing the games that they give me, i‚Äôve only had it for a few days, but i genuinely think it will help overtime. You should download it, because life is short and it‚Äôs just an app haha. You will probably enjoy it   Best of luck to all"
4,Erkle23,"I‚Äôve had issues in the past that really took a toll on my brain. Memory issues, not being able to say the things in my brain because I can‚Äôt find the right words, etc‚Ä¶ Doing these little exercises has helped me a lot especially with remembering things. I really like how you don‚Äôt have to be a genius to figure out the puzzles like some games. The different levels makes it not so intimidating and keeps you on your toes! Definitely recommend!"
5,shaka890,"I bought the 3 month subscription for $25 and have really been enjoying the mini games as well as the test they administer. I was looking for an app/game that works out my brain, this is perfect. Small 5-10 min breaks and I can play a few games. My head ‚Äúhurts‚Äù after some of these games, been a week and I can tell It‚Äôs working. Plus they track your progress and shows how you‚Äôre improving. If you have the spare $ I recommend it."
5,doug_1963,"Being in my 60s, I want to make sure that I do what I can for my brain and reducing the chances of cognitive decline. I‚Äôve tried many different apps for this. Typically they all fill like silly games, but this impulse felt different from the beginning. I thoroughly enjoy the activities. Don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm playing some game design for a 20 something. Started off doing the trial, but within an hour decided to purchase it."
5,TifaniAnn,"I do not typically play or download games, however I have been in need of something to assist in guiding my focus, and sharpen my skills. This app is a perfect quick game that also allows me to direct my focus.   So far I‚Äôve only played for a few days, but I would recommend it. Although the cost is low, it is still unmanageable for my finances so I am not going to be able to continue playing. I do hope to return."
4,HULAHUKAGURL,"I did not even know there was a game out here like this.. the game surprised me!! Kind of, it was like poof‚Äôin HEY YOU!! And the game itself picked me and I downloaded or added it?? I am happy about it though.  Atleast, it reminds me to stay on track and work that mind when I have been offline for awhile, just showered, dealing with a lot of stuff at once where I truely do not know how to feel. ATLEAST, THE GAME STAYS ON TRACK WITH ME AND ALWAYS CHECKS IN ON ME AND REMINDS ME THAT I AM IMPORTANT and THAT MY MIND AND THE ACTIVITY AND ACTIVATION GOING ON IN MY MIND IS STILL THERE.   #NOWAYIAMGIVINGUP #ONMYMIND #truemeaningofimportant #TRAININGMYMINDWITHGAMES"
5,J_Master12456,The challenges are a bit easy but that‚Äôs only cause I started yesterday. The app said they would get more challenging as I go on so that‚Äôs cool. The challenges are enjoyable and seeing how I stack up against everyone either makes me feel proud or makes me want to try the challenge again for a better score. I wish there were a bit more challenges in the daily ones. Great app to incorporate into your daily routine.
4,DeltaDefSquadYo,"Like I said in the title, it's fun and you want to keep playing. The stats are cool as well, they are encouraging, at least to me, to keep attempting to get a better score.  I notice that it really helps me bolster certain cognitive abilities, like memory, pattern recognition, problem-solving, etc.  Way back in 2015, I was in an auto accident, and had a traumatic brain injury. These are the types of games that were recommended by doctors and specialists to strengthen my cognitive development. This one happens to be fun too."
5,usmc6711,"As with life itself, Impulse promotes growth in thinking and observation along with differentiation and prioritization.  When ones ability to assess and retrieve useful information, or the efficient storage of it because the ability to do so has been diminished from cancer and chemotherapy, it trains the mind to regain what was lost . I like it because it helps regain functionality in life and in a fun way. Thanks for such a useful tool!"
5,Raylewis777,"I love impulse becauee I Lowkey feel like it helped me get my critical thinking skills back tbh, and for those out there who think it‚Äôs dumb to try and get smarter , or that your stuck where you are then your wrong . Because everybody can get smarter it‚Äôs just if you have supports , and impulse is one of my supports that I feel keeps me up even if I miss a day i still feel motivated to try and beat the next level, to do better on the challenges."
5,Sophie_natural,"Honestly, I think impulse can actually help you build up muscle memory and etc‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm not just going to tell lies about the progress. I just downloaded the game a day ago, but I do see them being fun and Intellectual! I will update on progress as much as I can but so far they are enjoyable games. Some can actually challenge you. For example the candy sorting one I had to see what would happen if I put one candy in the other tube etc‚Ä¶."
5,NBERNENS,"I‚Äôm hooked on this app. I play it multiple times a day. One recommendation would be to add different games or advanced games once each game is mastered. I have mastered so many games that it can get repetitive playing the same ones every day.  But, it is a great app for memorization and brushing up your math skills!  There are puzzles to challenge your brain and also IQ tests which are fun to take. Overall, I do love this app and I‚Äôm hooked, it‚Äôs addicting & I play every morning!"
5,JessAriasMommy,"I found this app on TT. I wasn‚Äôt sure about it, especially considering they asked you to  immediately pay for a subscription and only offer a 3 day free trail. They do offer a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù for a lifetime subscription for 30 something dollars. I‚Äôve only played for 2 days but I do really enjoy it. I‚Äôll update my review after spending a few weeks on the app. After some time, I‚Äôll be able to tell wether it‚Äôs actually helping me improve."
5,Squadrush78,I wake up and start my day off with training and at first I got tired really quickly but by the third day I wasn‚Äôt as tired.  You work out your brain like a muscle it‚Äôs gonna hurt a little bit or you‚Äôre gonna get tired is what I noticed about doing this app people give up when they‚Äôre like bored or they feel tired but that‚Äôs the whole part of it because you‚Äôre training your brain actually work.!! Great app love it
4,Markimus123,"Great app. Keeps me sharp and my fidgety hands busy. I really enjoyed the IQ/personality tests and paid for the results after an instagram ad kept advertising tests I hadn‚Äôt taken that I was interested in. After paying for the subscription I can‚Äôt access the tests that were advertised and only can access the original 12 I had already taken. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have paid for the subscription if I‚Äôd known that, but still enjoy the games/apps I do have access to."
4,Brooke1119,"While training my brain & working games, it gives me the satisfaction of ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù while settling my brain down. Im always on go, and its hard to turn the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù off in the evenings. Honestly- the recent surge in social media videos really took a tole on my mental health. I couldnt get off. After deleting many apps i havent found a way to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù at night, or distract my thoughts. I really enjoy this app a lot. And plus, it can only help your brain strength in the long run ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Personofsomeintelligence,I meant what I said in the title it gives the most accurate is tests and it‚Äôs mind games and mind workouts are of a high level. The training that it gives definitely shows improvements of all sorts to every aspect of your intelligence. I saw many improvements to my iq including my score going from 114 to 122 in just 1 month. I continue to use this app to strengthen my brain and I would suggest it to any ages from 7-127. Thank you impulse.
2,TetrisFan7,"I downloaded this since I was quite curious and took the IQ test. However, I was extremely disappointed when after I spent about 25 minutes doing my test expecting the results when sadly, they force you to pay for the stupid Weekly or Annual subscription to see the full results‚Ä¶. (They literally only show the IQ score and I ain‚Äôt paying $8 for a dang ‚ÄúWeekly‚Äù subscription!) Why didn‚Äôt they say that BEFORE I took the test?! Now, I feel like I just wasted my darn time with this app! Pitiful and disappointing! I can‚Äôt stand it when companies do the stupid false advertising thing‚Ä¶."
1,Grease Rocks,"This app advertised that i would get to see my ADHD type, such as inattentive, impulsive, hyperactive etc, and i immediately was asked to pay after i had already accepted the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù to read my results. Then when i paid the 6.99 for a weeks subscription (again, after the app said when i signed up for the free trial there would be no payment during my trial) all the quiz told me was that it would be helpful to see a professional. To be clear, it DID NOT tell me my adhd type or ways i can help my symptoms like the ad suggested. it just said see a professional.   VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL BE SEEKING A REFUND, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU CAME FROM THE ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS *NOT* THE APP ADVERTISED"
4,milfinatx,"This game is a lot of fun and stimulating. But I‚Äôve noticed a lot of their elements especially in the spelling challenge, that there‚Äôs a ton of mentions of war, weapons, suicide, depression‚Ä¶even the emojis they chose to use on the game were all weapons and stuff. I just thought that was a bit strange bc the more I played the more I noticed there was SO MUCH stuff on is about weapons, war, and suicide. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the only one who notices this but it definitely caught my attention enough to write a review about it."
5,Flutterbyass420,"A great game to play because it‚Äôs so much fun, while also, keeping your brain on its toes, so to speak, with the puzzle choices and quizzes one can do in the app. It‚Äôs trying but it‚Äôs so interesting and just all around fun. It‚Äôs honestly great for those with age, getting older you forget some things in life once learned so many years ago. We need to be reminded of those things every now and then. It really does help ones brain stay more focused and sharp."
5,That‚Äôs what I said,"Until I found impulse , when I would take abreak from my daily tasks I would occupy my brain by playing money winning games but without adding money just playing with my daily free gems ! I would end up getting agitated & frustrated & laying down doing nothing more than contributing to my already full blown procrastination! Impulse is different , it is truely an exercise for your brain !! So glad I found it  !!"
2,NEWCIDERFAN,"I signed up for the free trial but felt I didn‚Äôt have the time to actually use the app. To unsubscribe they ask you to either email the company, or cancel through your account with the website. If you sign up through the AppStore you cant unsubscribe through the website. I managed to cancel it directly through my AppStore subscription management. But for an app to make it so difficult to unsubscribe =shady. That and make sure you read the small print on free trials, to not be charged after the free trial you HAVE to unsubscribe 24 hours prior to free trial ending."
5,Ems Input,I am absolutely loving this brain training technique I believe strongly that their methods of training are exactly what people need to keep their minds sharp because just like it has always been said people that stay active are definitely people who will have less health issues I believe the same for our brain someone who keeps utilizing their brain will have a better chance at keeping it sharp and healthy as well!!!!
1,Mrsuspenders,"I got a Facebook ad that said I could download this app and take a free test to see my ADHD type.    I took the test and then it said to get the results I would have to subscribe to paid plan.    So I guess the test is free, but if you want the results you have to pay for them.    And then they had other marketing strategies in the app where they offered to give me the maximum discount out of 3 discounts in a chance game.  Wow! Lucky Me!     How could I pass up an offer.  Anytime you spin a wheel for a deal on a digital platform, it‚Äôs rigged.    Maybe I can see all of this because on the first three games I played I did over 90% better than all my peers.  And if what they calculated wasn‚Äôt rigged to make myself feel superior, it‚Äôs more likely because my peers are not gullible people that turn to digital snake oil to work out their issues.    That was harsh üò¢.   I didn‚Äôt play it for very long.  But those were my impressions.  If you have spent more time with the app and find it beneficial that sounds coolüëç"
5,Mrs.Allen2.0,I downloaded this app because I‚Äôve been bored and I‚Äôve been looking for something other than solitaire. I just happened to scroll across this app and I decided to give it a try. First off I didn‚Äôt want to pay for it. But I ended up getting 92% off the annual price so I decided to pay for it. And I‚Äôm so glad I did! It‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. It keeps me intrigued and I am so glad I made the decision. I love this app.
1,Hmgbrd9,"This is an application that makes it impossible to unsubscribe. I have sent emails to them asking to unsubscribe my account from renewal and they have not replied for over three weeks. *** And now I received an email from the support team to tell me that there‚Äôs a link I click on to cancel subscription. When I click on the link there is nooooooo place to select CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION. Wrong sir, the subscription is not able to be handled by myself because you don‚Äôt give that option, but there are about 7 different $$ plans to select to stay with the app. Please cancel my subscription like I asked the first time. Thank you"
5,Blatantly Honest Reviews,"I am going to be clear, I am not a bot. I have been looking for games to keep my mind sharp and this is the best one I have found! Others are very intrusive on making you pay for a subscription but Impulse is not. Impulse gives the user great games which are mentally challenging and can help keep your mind sharp in memory, speed, decision making, and others. Overall amazing app and I definitely recommend it for you."
5,Exhausted_Emery,"This game is just great overall, i spend hours on it a day cause i just can‚Äôt bring myself to do something else! Though, i‚Äôm a night owl, and the home screen kinda blinds me. So i‚Äôm requesting a dark mode option. Dark mode would make playing at night (which i normally do) so much easier and i‚Äôd probably be playing longer. Other than that, the game is amazing! I‚Äôd totally recommend it to anyone and everyone."
5,cycleofhands,"The little games are fun and even if the brain work and improvement is minor it is still satisfying to feel like I am doing brain workouts.   The general IQ test is really fascinating and I am so curious about the science behind it. I have no doubts abstract / complex pattern recognition does indeed point to general brain efficiency, but what about the questions are suited to measure functionality and if the results line up pretty evenly to scores on other IQ tests.   Definitely try it out"
5,dracula.mcgoo,"This app is, as titled above, made up of many fun and easy to learn puzzle games. These games use eye-catching, brightly colored designs to keep each user not only involved and interested, but more importantly mentally stimulated, constantly thinking and collectively learning. Memory, problem solving and mathematics are just a few of the areas Impulse‚Äôs games help to improve. Highly suggest at least trying, you won‚Äôt fly if you don‚Äôt send üèÑüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§òüèø"
5,r.iley.v3,i found this app on an instagram ad ( shocker huh?) and i really like it. i go to a private school and im way ahead all my peers and since the school is so small we don‚Äôt have advanced classes. This app allows me to challenge myself on my own personal time since my school can‚Äôt do it. i got this last night and im ADDICTED. I turn 16 in late december and i took the IQ test and got 110. I like this app and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about getting it
5,Slinkie2802,I feel my brain getting stronger everyday I use the app.  The games are quick and I can tell when I find an area I need to work on.  As all 50+ struggles with memory lapses I feel that most of these games have some type of memory spin and they help me build back my memory muscle.  I don‚Äôt love games but these go by fast!  There are a couple like ancient numbers and color sort that I enjoy just for the fun of them.
1,P/O USER,"Downloaded from an ad on Facebook because the line game looked fun. During the initial setup, it tries to trick you into paying for a subscription at $6.99/month. Get around that and you play three games and bam, ad. Messed up? Ad. Want to try another game? Ad. Woah! Make sure your push notifications are on so we can annoy you! Oh hey, try subscribing. Tried the old trick of turning on airplane mode to get around the ads and then it won‚Äôt even let you play the game. Had it installed for maybe 5 minutes and ended up watching 8 ads. Games are mediocre at best to boot. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this even to a monkey."
5,LaurynLoveXO,"I love this app! I‚Äôm not typically a game person when it comes to my phone. On a daily basis, I probably use about 5-6 out of the 28 apps I have on my phone. Idk what made me decide to download this one but I‚Äôm so glad I did! I feel healthier in a sense, every time I complete a new challenge. It‚Äôs addicting! I love that it gives you a description of the benefits you gain from each activity. Definitely glad I found this app!!"
5,Epsilon1942,"I like this app alot and use it daily, though every so often I want to use on an iPad for a bigger screen but I notice that there is no option to sync with iCloud ( or even with the email) as far as I can see, maybe I‚Äôm wrong and I‚Äôm just not seeing this setting somewhere within the app. If this is not currently supported, are there plans to implement this in the future?"
1,Mrceethree,"After asking a bunch of questions of what you would to do with your brain. You are brought to a screen to pay for subscriptions only. When you don‚Äôt want to do this you can do a week only trial. When I saw this I deleted the app right away. After reading the 1* apps before leaving mine, noticed that the developer mentioned in some of those, that there is Ads that can be watch to access some content. They may need to restructure their approach other than wanting people to pay right away. There is plenty of free tools out there for brain help. Don‚Äôt invest in this app unless you think it is completely necessary."
5,"Great, awsome, nice app","This app has me playing everyday now. Which is very great because it distracts me and it made me more clever. For example, the games they have in the app. It‚Äôs easy and then it gets harder and harder. But since I started with easy first and understood wha I had to do. I become more clever. I would tell my friends to try and they wouldn‚Äôt get it and I would get it and they be like ‚Äúwhaaattt howwwww??‚Äù Lmaoo. Overall it‚Äôs a great app to have."
5,immackulate,"All the little games are really fun, and the statistics they give you afterward are really encouraging! It makes you feel accomplished even though it just takes a few minutes a day. They also have a lot of personality quizzes and little tests to help you understand yourself better. Totally worth the money if you have it, but even if you can‚Äôt pay for a subscription there‚Äôs a lot to gain from using this app."
5,NewlyGreen,"I was hesitant to try this out; I‚Äôve had ADHD literally my whole life, and we tend to find our own work arounds‚Ä¶but I only did these exercises about 5/10 days since installed, and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN MY MEMORY. This is huge for me, as I tend to forget short to mid term things and often lose my train of thought. I‚Äôm going for focus next.  This is the only app that‚Äôs made a marked difference in my memory, and that was with 60% effort. I am so happy I found this."
5,boycefromdallas,"The best workout is in the mind. The exercises  are new versions of new ways to focus on the senses by training. This strategy has made me fundamentally (see I even started saying fundamentally) more adept to understand what processes create the abilities each person is born with yet having to endure a mundane environment becomes a vacuum to those instinctual phenomena that are innately trying to avoid repression. If you don‚Äôt pay attention to it , your mind goes to waste."
5,Brendakw64,"I enjoy playing Impulse because the games are designed with intellectual purposes, and I like knowing that I‚Äôm training my brain to be sharper, clearer and just all-around better. I like that the games score you against others, so you can see where you stand and what you may need to improve. I also enjoy that there are aptitude tests for IQ, ADHD, and other things available if you‚Äôd like to know your scores."
5,gc56223,This does help you out. If your like me that gets mad so quickly for things but can hold yourself from making a mistake that can destroy you or your life trust me stop and get the app out and try to do this. Once‚Äôs your done you‚Äôll be a bit better I mean calmer then how you were. This is a very good app. I rated this app after a month and some change to give it a honest review. So people don‚Äôt sleep on this app. Thank you good day.
5,Ski scan,I‚Äôm writing this review a little early. Everything seems good so far. A little on the east side but I figure things will get harder. I don‚Äôt like that simple mistakes cannot be fixed. Example. A problem was set up in a way that made it look like division instead of subtraction. The example we worked out before we started wasn‚Äôt set up that way. Maybe that was part of it tho. I‚Äôm not sure. But so far so good.
3,Elisemarie66,"I‚Äôve been seeing ads which make it seem as though this app will personalize your brain training, based on the results you receive in various personality, archetype and IQ tests. I tried the free trial and I was disappointed to find out that the brain training exercises are just generic memory and card-matching games. I tried to take the ‚Äúyour archetype‚Äù test and, only after answering the all of the questions, the app requires users to upgrade to an paid-up-front annual plan before it will reveal your results."
5,BOMB APP and fun too!,"With dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs, running on my maternal and paternal side of the family, I‚Äôve been looking for something to stimulate my brain and keep it busy during brief periods of down time when I don‚Äôt have enough time to get into reading an article or education material. This app is great because I can play quick games that stimulate my thought process, and I also get to test and learn more about my own personality."
5,Brea564,"I originally downloaded this game only for the brain quizzes they offer, as I was curious about my personality type, ADHD type, and IQ level. I know it‚Äôs not clinically administered, but it was really interesting to get detailed insight on all those things!! There‚Äôs so many more games than I expected, day one I think I played for 3 hours straight and I hardly noticed how much time passed. Oops! I‚Äôm curious to see how my skills improve over time, especially mental math!"
5,Lolo_beanz,I downloaded this app a couple days ago and immediately loved it! The games are fun and challenging and doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äòtraining my brain‚Äô.  My only issue for me is it seems there is no way to sync progress across multiple devices (?). I took some of the tests on my iPad and played some games on my iPhone but neither shows the other devices progress.  Would love that ability!
5,mason.bohm,I‚Äôm lowkey addicted to this app. It‚Äôs so interesting and it rlly helps you learn more about yourself and how your brain works. It backs everything up with statistics and others scores. I definitely would recommend the yearly plan. Only 30 bucks if you get the discount and it‚Äôs 100 percent worth it. They have so many activities to do and it really trains your brain to keep u sharp and active. Definitely would recommend this. 10/10
5,KyeKye2231,"This game is great! There is nothing I would change about it. This game has kept my brain sharp and I am learning bc things way quicker than I used to. I love this game, and not only that but it barely has any ads! It has one ad every like 10 minutes. I recommend it, there are many different options to use the app for too, you can use it to manage stress or keep your brain sharp or other options."
5,UofYou,"I used to be so dumb I could even drool correctly, but since downloading this app I‚Äôve been able to dramatically improve my cognition and genius surrounding a multitude of different disciplines. I‚Äôve recently applied to MIT, Harvard and Yale and was awarded full ride scholarships to each all thanks to impulse!  Momma said‚Ä¶ my momma said that If you don‚Äôt download this app right now and sign up for the premium you may have something wrong with your medula oblongotta!"
4,hammy lover721543,It‚Äôs really ü§© fun. And I love ‚ù§Ô∏è everything about it. I have really nothing to complain about. It‚Äôs really fun ü§© and it helps you with getting smarter. I‚Äôm in third grade and my teacher is so nice üòä. But sometimes a little bit harsh. Still she is a good teacher and I‚Äôll miss her when I go to fourth grade nest year. Still back to the game. The game is really fun ü§© and I give it four stars ‚≠êÔ∏è. Not that it‚Äôs bad or anything. It‚Äôs a fun game really fun ü§© it is. And I just want to say ‚Äú Thank you üòä Inpulse for the game.‚Äù And sorry üò£ if I misspelled your game name.
5,Canivel,"We can all say that we want to get better at remembering things and keeping our brain sharp. It‚Äôs common that if you continue to practice a little by little you will get better at certain things that you‚Äôre trying, with this app it seems that I will be able to sharpen my skills and have fun at the same time so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing my continual growth while using this app."
5,Rose Morrison,"Love this brain game, but I would love it even more if they can make it free. Why should we have to pay for wanting to be educated? Education should be free. Having free education will help so many people and it will give so many people better opportunities to do better for themselves and it will give people jobs and that will keep people off of the streets so they are not homeless and on drugs if we had free education. Think about it."
1,lacee2008,"Once I found that basically everything was hidden behind a paywall, I deleted the app AND unsubscribed. However, two days later I was still charged. Nowhere in any setting do I have the option to unsubscribe a second time. I even downloaded the app again, stumbled through all of the fake discount pop ups, and IN the app it says I‚Äôm subscribed but does not have an option to unsubscribe either- so I guess I‚Äôm just stuck paying a $6.99 fee for an app I don‚Äôt want to use when I‚Äôm thousands of dollars in medical debt. That makes sense. I‚Äôm so tired of apps pretending to be helpful when they only want your money. Sticking with Happify and UCLA mindful."
5,cailliecat1,This really is a very fun way to train your brain. There are some games in it that are a little hard but that‚Äôs the point the more I try the better I get!!  I really love this app and was surprised at how user friendly it was. I get frustrated with apps and Lowkey bored so I‚Äôll app surf but this one keeps me playing on it forever and  is really smooth with tons of options for games to play. Definitely recommend 12/10
5,emliy4537,so so so the app is amazing it‚Äôs learnable it‚Äôs teachable and most of all it‚Äôs fun!

5,Ryan Leehan,I bought a subscription for both me and my best friend and we both love it. I was never into brain game apps but this one has surpassed my expectations. She loves these kind of apps and has been constantly playing the games and doing the workouts. The workouts are her absolute favorite part of the app. Definitely worth the money. We both got 92% discounts and I absolutely am proud of what I am getting for my money.
5,Abreebee,"Did a quiz, paid for full version/results (it‚Äôs 6.99 per week but you can cancel and do one purchase if that‚Äôs your thing), did the rest of the quizzes, then played all 235 levels of Draw One Line in three days. They have lots of games though, and I think I‚Äôll move on to the one that‚Äôs like Wordle. Overall worth downloading free, and worth at least $7 if you want the quiz results. There‚Äôs IQ, fear response, emotional intelligence, and more."
5,what will i do,"I really enjoy Impluse. This is my third day doing the tasks/games. I really like how you can set your own setting, and get games specialized for you! I also enjoy that you only have about 3-5 games tasks to do a day! You can set your notifications to let Impluse remind you of when to do your tasked games. So far, I haven‚Äôt ran into any trouble. If you need a game that helps with anxiety, s/a, or any other triggers, than Impluse is just for you! <33."
5,Face22222536,"I held off purchasing until they offered a much lower annual rate and I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôve enjoyed way more than I expected!  I got on a 22 day streak and it felt good to accomplish something that could help my memory and brain function. I have a family history of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs so I know even small daily brain quizzes can be beneficial. They‚Äôre fun, easy, and I‚Äôd rather dump time into puzzles than mindless scrolling on social media!"
5,HBG1994,"This is the best way to train your brain, my memory and overall cognitive ability has drastically improved. I received a discounted subscription through an advertisement online and have since switched phones and cannot get back on my original account. I still use it everyday but I am disappointed I lost my progress. By all accounts this app does work, thank you."
5,Nope no ‚Äúname‚Äù or ‚Äúnickname‚Äù,"This is an amazing app to train your brain. I highly suggest getting it. Even though there are a few adds, it‚Äôs worth it. You can do these tests, and brain-games, and even test your personality. I have only one complaint. It always keeps bugging me to get the ‚ÄúPremium Edition‚Äù thingy, and it‚Äôs gotten kinda annoying. But Impulse is such a great brain app, so good! It‚Äôs addicting, I will admit it. But still, you MUST consider getting it. Thanks for reading!"
5,Ale_TheOne,"at first, I was a little skeptical, but as I started to play with the three day trial, I really liked it and so far I am only on my third day but I can tell it does help a lot and it constantly gives my brain something to think about which is good! Honestly, five stars indeed!! Plus, it gives you a lot of different games so you really truly only need this app and you will have a lot of games in it."
5,cocobutta522,It‚Äôs really important to me that I am using parts of my brain I don‚Äôt always get a chance to work on. I had a stroke in the past so I‚Äôve had to learn from the beginning again‚Ä¶ I am doing some games and more in this app that I was doing in the hospital to help train my brain again. It‚Äôs nice to be able to continue improving my health after I‚Äôve been out of the hospital. Would definitely recommend this game
2,Fiery1,"I was hoping for more out of this app to be honest. I emailed the company to share feedback directly. Almost every day I am given the same games, whether I score horribly or very well. This ends up making me not want to play it, though I‚Äôve been putting in my session time regardless. Also, I would expect some ‚Äútips‚Äù after time, suggestions on how to improve scores in upcoming sessions, or a different game to be offered that works on the same skills through a different approach. I think there is plenty of room for improvement here. This is a purchase I regret."
1,andrea.cardonazz,"The app itself is repetitive and after a day of playing these games you will get bored. The games are not challenging at all, and are always the same ones the levels barely get harder‚Äî I don‚Äôt think this actually trains your brain at all. Not to mention I did the free trial, but obviously it makes you put in your credit card. I tried to cancel the trial, sent numerous emails, and it is impossible to do so. I am having trouble getting refunded for it and overall think this app is a scam save yourself the trouble. If you really want to train your brain go read a book, or complete a puzzle‚Äî believe me there are much better ways."
5,Piccilo the Reaper,"Impulse is incredible. I have finally found an app that activated my brain in a healthy way and helps strengthen my memory, reflexes and thinking. Definitely one of the best time passer apps I have ever downloaded.   Impulse also offers things like IQ tests, personality quizzes and so much more.   I love how the mini games also increase in difficulty each time you complete a daily challenge. Definitely keeps it interesting."
3,Roseann152,"Impulse was just automatically renewed.  I have been trying to cancel the subscription, but I have been unable to do so. When I went into the original app site, it mentions app support but when I sent my message it just remains stagnant so I‚Äôm not even sure if they‚Äôre getting the message. I know that this is a very good app because friends of mine have used it. Unfortunately, I have been unable to do so for personal reasons. Response from the company would be really helpful in this situation."
5,Irenenumber2sinceirenewastaken,"I was hesitant to pay the monthly fee because I didn‚Äôt want another unnecessary subscription Im probably not going to use BUT I have ADHD and struggle a lot in areas of focus, memory and impulsivity. I just started it and it‚Äôs already entertaining my brain. I like how they increase difficulty and compare your score to other people so you can see your growth within time. You pick if you want 5 / 10 or 20 minutes per day. I picked 10."
5,QueenIshh Cloud9,"It‚Äôs great !! You actually want to play and really enjoy playing and then finding out your personal results and they even let you know how you compare with people your age as well !! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone at least give it a try!! Why not !?? It won‚Äôt hurt you or take from you at all!! You can only gain from this awesome app! So don‚Äôt wait, stop procrastinating and JUST DO IT üòâ"
5,Lindsay2000,"Seriously all the little pop ups that tell me Im out performing 75% 78% 89% even 99% of my peers haha. Love the games, they aren‚Äôt hard but they do make you think. For the texts/mental exams it would be cool to see some new options become available like the Meyers-briggs test but the current ones are great if you feel like you need help with self reflection/introspection. Overall big fan of this app."
4,I am a Lauren Z side fan,"I really like this game because really fun and it‚Äôs also like learning but in like a really fun way and it‚Äôs for your brain and it really helps though even though I don‚Äôt feel any different and it‚Äôs actually kind of relaxing and I love doing all these like games and stuff so maybe in a while that I can maybe feel smarter a better memory, and can sort stuff better and do math better it‚Äôs actually really fun and I think that you should get this game or app"
5,MikeyRatea,"This game that I'm playing is satisfying, making me smart, and most importantly, it's a fun game. I definitely recommend trying this game. Im glad that easy games can actually make you smart. Who would've thought. This is definitely worth to be put in the 5 star box. I'm glad they make some games that are good for me. That's some material to tell you that this games perfect for people who want to be smart."
5,Sassy8717,I‚Äôm a 42yr old mom and I actually enjoyed this game. It makes you think and no game is alike. It gets harder as you go and requires you to zone out the background and pay attention.  Won‚Äôt be paying the ridiculously expensive price for the ‚Äúfull app‚Äù but what you get for free is 100% worth it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúcalming‚Äù app by any means but perfect for sitting in car loop or just during the day if you have 20min free time.
5,jessicalynn_*,"Impressed to be honest, can‚Äôt afford to purchase the app, but memory, iq tests really help people like myself, so far, I am impressed. Like to see what I can do at minimal with the results that they provide on the free version. So many good apps, just that they all cost a pretty penny, which is the only bad things about these types of apps. Indeed they can help people of all backgrounds and abilities. Just wished that it was accessible for everyone"
5,Mere67193,"I love the app so far. Great fun games that are just the right amount of challenge to be fun but feel like you‚Äôre working your brain for them. Cool tests too, to lead about yourself! I bought the subscription and have played every day. It‚Äôs also not so addicting like other phone games that you don‚Äôt want to put it down. I can easily take a 5 or 10 minute break to play and go back to my work."
5,shell81bell,I suffer from a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and I just found this game. It really is helpful. I just started playing and I‚Äôm excited to keep playing as the puzzles get more difficult. I need these exercises because I have some short-term memory loss and need reminders because things just vanish in my mind. I think this game is a great way to strengthen my brain and process things easier and  faster and maybe help remember daily tasks and such.
5,dudeitsmemiley455,"I never normally leave reviews, but I was very impressed by this app! In July I was in a severe car accident and had a traumatic brain injury along with other things. I‚Äôve been dealing with memory issues since then, and became afraid and anxious for quite a while. I got this app just to see if it would do anything and I can honestly say that after using this app for a while it has helped me tremendously. So thank you!!"
1,Mr$...T!!n|< babii,"I kept seeing this game and finally decided to download it cause I‚Äôm a puzzle person and was really interested! After getting this particular question ‚ÄúA man who has people working for him especially servants or slaves‚Ä¶.‚Äù And the answer to unscramble be MASTER!! I deleted it and will never recommend this game! I will be posting on all my social media plate forms in hopes to have the maker remove the question, the games getting shut down, and have them apologize to everyone! I hope all races who believe in things like this shouldn‚Äôt be on here erase this game cause this is horrible. What if there is a smart child playing this game and they have come across it!!"
5,Wendyn3boys,I practice this daily. I notice the difference from when I‚Äôm stressed and or sleepy vs bright but I also try hard to do my daily challenges. I‚Äôd like it more if I could say how I ‚Äúfeel‚Äù my brain was working. I even did it the day my besties passed away. I did horrible but I wanted to continue the challenges to get the most out of it. It‚Äôs a couple minutes a day just for you!
5,Muh Ris Uhhh,"I don‚Äôt really enjoy phone games honestly. But this app has several different games, each with its own purpose. The games help train your attention, focus, critical thinking, memory, etc. They range in difficulty and each game has levels to increase your skill level. It‚Äôs a super fun app and it‚Äôs free! Also, this app is a wonderful break from social media when I don‚Äôt know what else to do."
5,No sirreee bob,"The games are quick, so it‚Äôs not inconvenient to give my brain a little extra exercise when I have downtime. The directions are easy to understand to complete the challenges, and I also like that it shows your results in comparison to other users. Works other parts of your brain that you may not use normally on a daily basis. A worthwhile purchase to stay sharp!"
5,Ezzy Dabows,"look meditation or picking up a new hobby can take up a lot of time, energy and planning to get your brain building and maintaining  new connections but this app will help you do that for a few minutes a day! With an affordable lifetime option, i‚Äôve been using impulse (on and off) for about 2 years and i can see the growth i‚Äôve made not only in the app but especially in my executive functioning skills!"
5,SakuraStardust12,"I‚Äôve been drilling with a lot of anxiety and stress lately. I also feel like I have a hard time focusing. The games in this app have really been helping me a lot! I feel calmer, sharper, and more focused when I dedicate at least 10 minutes to playing the games each morning. If you want to find a way to reduce anxiety and improve focus, in a way that‚Äôs not via meditation, then I really recommend this app!"
5,bronzebennett,This app is excellent. It has so many types of games to play and I love how they build upon one another to create a personalized experience for the user. I especially love the game where you have to sort between paper and plastic even though that‚Äôs the one I scored lowest on. It trained my brain to see things differently. There is another game as well where you train in order of operations that was great as well.
1,cucumber899,"Would not give a single star- Unable to opt out . Did not give me the option to cancel after download . Immediately after download was shown a screen stating free trial and xx fees after one week or so. It was shown for only a few seconds and before I could figure out how to cancel it ( as I did not want to pay) it took me to the terms and conditions page .In the terms and conditions it says I need to cancel within 24 hrs of the end of the free trial from apple subscriptions  , but when I go to the apple subscriptions- this shows up as free trial and is not letting me cancel it. Even within the app , I can‚Äôt figure out how to cancel ."
5,ddfkkkjj,"I love this app so far ! I hate I have to pay for it to get the full benefits but anything worth having is worth paying for. Social media apps are free because they provide no benefit this app charges because it makes you better. Deleted social media apps to try to focus more and thought it would be hard. Downloading this app made it super easy, haven‚Äôt even thought about scrolling ."
2,KM19472,"Watch ads longer than you play a game for. I don‚Äôt mind having ads, but this is excessive.  Edit after developer response: after 10-15 seconds of an ad, you can press >>. Then press done, then press X. That‚Äôs 3 clicks to remove an ad. The ad is often after every single level of a game, some being only 10 seconds long. No thanks, I‚Äôve already deleted the app and moved on to something less frustrating. I suggest you play your own app (with ads) and see how long you last. PS, $50 is far more than the ‚Äúprice of a few cups of coffee‚Äù."
5,kmacfresh,"I like that besides the mental training, there are psychological tests to see what personality type you are, for example. The app helps you to learn your attributes, hone in on what may need improvement on, and generally just get a better idea of what characteristics you have. The tests aren‚Äôt super long, so you can easily set & meet a minimal goal and strive for more if you‚Äôre up for the task! I think you too will enjoy Impulse."
5,My brain perfect now,This is the best way to help learn to have impulse control focus and learn that is an app. I would highly recommend this game. And when u get to open the gifts it‚Äôs no a scam it will not make you pick a very low percentage off. When I opens the box I got 92% off that‚Äôs how I know it‚Äôs not a scam. If you download this app because you want to do brain workouts not just play games I‚Äôm sure you would like it. Have a good dayüòä
5,Jesus‚Äôs little girlüòÅ,"I like games that will help you keep your brain sharp, and this bye far is one of the best, I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs easy to follow and clear to understand with a wide variety of activities, that‚Äôs not all either, my favorite part  of this app would probably be the personality quiz and the left vs right brain quiz to test which side of the brain you use the most. All in all this app is a lot of fun, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.üòÅ"
1,Cxangel123,"s c a m, immediately they try and force you to pay for their stupid extra stuff. I ‚Äúwon‚Äù 94% off and it was advertised as 56 CENTS a WEEK so I figured oh okay and my only option being hit yes or lose the deal. They took the full 30$ out of my account and I‚Äôm extremely upset because that is absolutely NOT what I agreed to. Immediately deleted the app because I don‚Äôt even want it anymore. I also informed many friends family and colleagues to not even bother and they all agree! Put yourself in my shoes, I just wanted a little mental comfort and help and figured I‚Äôd give it a shot but now I am out 30$ on an app???? Absolutely not. Disgusting."
5,TinaRen19,"(real review- not sponsored!!) i just starting adding this to my daily routine because i want to keep my brain healthy. i‚Äôm a world where most of us are sitting in front of tv or social media most of the day, it‚Äôs so healthy to remember your brain and keep it sharp!! i love that they keep track of your daily streak and gives you a variety of different games each day. 10/10 for sure"
1,Scoped00,"I gave this app a try and signed up for an annual because it said I could cancel anytime.  After a couple of days I decided to cancel. I figured they‚Äôd pro-rate me and only charge for a couple of days, or worst case scenario charge for a month.  Nope. They are making me stick with it for the full year. My cancellation won‚Äôt go into affect until it‚Äôs time for the 1 yr renewal.  I did not see any small print that would have made that clear. Bad faith, guys.  The games are ok, not great.  Some things don‚Äôt make sense such as how they keep track of your scores vs those of your peers.  Also the progress chart is not intuitive."
3,Brace_Bear,"My biggest gripe is that the program puts a badge on the icon, and when you open the program to see what the badge represented, there are ZERO, NADA, NO indications why the program put a badge on the icon. If your going to put a badge on the icon, at least have a clear reason why displayed when the user opens the program. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the mouse being offered the piece of cheese and then it‚Äôs yanked away, or the horse being teased by a carrot on a string. I must click the icon to find the prize within the app that doesn‚Äôt exist."
5,Jorro11,"Many of us have played various games on our phones for fun. This app makes an excellent choice of games that are fun in many ways while also engaging in ways that I‚Äôve found myself lacking compared to when I‚Äôve previously done them as a kid.   Excellent concept of an app, and one that I believe is beneficial versus many of the other time wasters that occupy our screen time."
5,Htide16,"I‚Äôve been playing the games for about a month. It gives you the games for the day to play, but you do have of the option of playing different games to choose from throughout the day. Some games are easy to play and some get harder as your progress in the game. The games have been very entertaining. I love that you have plenty of games to choose from. So far so good."
2,Ridiculous Amount of AdsüòÉ,"Game is great even for the LITE or free version. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I enjoy it. However, free version has a ridiculous amount of ads. Literally after every single button you click weather choosing a game or pressing the next button for next game, there. Is. An. Ad. Literally after every button. Even when you decide to change the game/challenge whatever you want to call it.   Like I said game is great but the amount of ads is totally unnecessary. It‚Äôs like one of those free and simple games made in China where there‚Äôs an ad after everything you press."
5,bsddddddd,"I have been using this app for a few days now and I already love it!  The app gives you daily challenges and also if you finish those they have free games!  The one and only thing about the app is that when you take any test on the app (IQ Test, Personality Quiz, etc.), it does show you your results but it only shows you a part of it, other then than I love it!"
5,IamreviewingSJ,Worthwhile time spent. I like that you can get in a quick brain exercise any time of day. Even 5 minutes. Or just a couple! Been missing my mind exercises and this is definitely helping to get back into flexing the MOST important ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù üí™  I would prefer not to be asked to pay for subscription all the time‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs how these things go. Try it out!
1,Libbi10315,"I‚Äôve been trying to cancel my subscription for a whole week now and they won‚Äôt let me and now they just took $7.51 out of my account when I literally was just about to spend on something else. I don‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt let me cancel my subscription. Please get this figured out because I‚Äôm done and I can‚Äôt delete the app because they won‚Äôt let me because I said if I delete the app it doesn‚Äôt cancel subscription but then I‚Äôm like I do my subscription is said it was already cancelled, but then why the heck are you guys charging me seven dollars still? Like get it together."
4,AubieWaddle,"First off, I love this game. It is great. My issue is that it is glitching a ton though. On Candy Sort especially, I will complete a few levels and then hop off. When I come back on, only every OTHER level is completed and I have to redo a bunch of other levels! If not for this, the game would have 5 stars. Also, on robotic flows, there are some levels that are wayyyy too easy as there are too many extra spaces that you can exploit. Someone fix this please!"
5,kidjvurnhjr,Love this app and get to play all the brainy games I love the most. I‚Äôve deleted all my other apps like this. It gives you workouts and you can play whichever ones you want aside from that. Even the areas of my biggest struggles where the other apps would make me so frustrated this one keep me below that frustration while still challenging me. And the other areas are just fun!
2,ice queen l,I downloaded this app because I saw quite a few ads about it on Tiktok. I used the free trial to do a test run and here‚Äôs what i‚Äôve decided. The app is absolutely not worth the David Hasselhoff that comes with it. The games are copies of free games you can easily download in the app store. The quizzes are useless because you can‚Äôt view the full report without a yearly subscription. This app seems to prey on people‚Äôs insecurities relative to mental capacity and it‚Äôs disturbing. Save your time & don‚Äôt bother. This app is a lackluster compilation of elements you can locate on the internet for free with a simple search.
5,Poohpadew,I love this game. It helps to keep your memory sharp and the games aren't that hard. They do increase in difficulty which I like. It lets you get used to the format of the games. I have enjoyed playing the games thus far. It has helped with my memory retention. I had a stroke and I have some cognitive issues so this seems to help. I also had some prior memory issues and it is helping with those also.
5,unable to track grade,I noticed an ad for this app on a social media platform. I usually swipe ads away but this caught my eye and decided to try it. I just started using it for 2 days at 5 minutes a day. It is interesting and fun. So far it doesn‚Äôt take too much of my time and doesn‚Äôt constantly send me notifications. It is straight to the point and instructions are clear and easy to follow.
4,MrsBromo11,So me and my friend were having a sleepover and let‚Äôs call my her Jenna so we were playing games on our phones together and we got bored of the ones we had so my friend downloaded it and I asked what game is that I said oh it‚Äôs called impulse she said and I went and downloaded it and omg I loved it but! I have a suggestion maybe you could like add friends and play Brain games with them like Co op anyway if you are looking to download it please download it‚Äôs such a good game :)
5,SB11086,"I really do enjoy playing this, it has daily challenges and many different ways to expand on your mind. Also it has really fun quizzes to test yourself. Sometimes you think you know but you don‚Äôt make sure to read the directions of the game thoroughly before playing it. It has been easier to use this app then have a bunch of the individual apps."
5,Blackwell222,"I have a neurological condition called Wernicke‚Äôs Encephalopathy. It affects the way I remember information and a lot of my memory is based on strong emotions. So if something makes me very nervous, excited, mad, happy, sad then I typically remember it. But everyday things like medications, appointments, showers, and etc. just slip. This app has given me a tool to practice and work on my memory in small ways! I love it and enjoy it very much."
2,Original-IIBorNotIIB,"This app is really cool but it prompts me to pay for premium with every interaction during my free trial‚Ä¶ (quite constant) then I took an archetype test which I was quite curious about the results of and it had me go all the way through (approx. 10min time commitment) just to inform me I couldn‚Äôt see my results without buying premium‚Ä¶ for a free trial, it didn‚Äôt feel free nor like a real trial. I miss single pay apps. üòî I‚Äôm deleting after this review. I get developers deserve to be paid, but where‚Äôs the middle ground? The app itself is well constructed and entertaining."
3,Ashley L B,"I‚Äôm torn between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I really do love the games, but the awful saving is almost gamebreaking.   I‚Äôve done over 650 levels of the candy sorting, but a lot of them say I haven‚Äôt beat the level (which of course I did, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to move forward). I completed a level a couple days ago that was a harder one than usual and took a few days of me coming back to it until I eventually got it. I then did a few levels after that one, no problem.   Except now I‚Äôve lost that progress, and I‚Äôm back to this awful level.  I‚Äôm a completionist. I want all the levels to have a pretty green checkmark, but if I go back to a level that didn‚Äôt save to give it the checkmark, then the level after that one no longer has a checkmark.   Make it make sense."
4,ZeikdaGad,"this app is cool because they give certain tests that i would like to know about myself in quick format. How accurate they are is another thing, but it does use user-base data against your scores so it measures your intellect against other users personal percentile, and thats something. Havent gone through personality tests and stuff, but i dont see any self help lessons or games that help anxiety/stress related things just more of memory, math and reactions. Still fun!"
3,Mae Valentine,"I took some of the tests and quizzes they have on there. Of course you have to pay to unlock your results. If this wasn‚Äôt a major pay to use app, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. The games are wonderful, and while somewhat limited. I feel like you‚Äôd have to play awhile to get bored of those specifically especially with the difficulty changing every time. We should have access to the results of the tests offered if they are offered for free. Otherwise I‚Äôm wasting my time."
5,D√´ZZ√ø,"I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. It can provide me with insights into myself and my thought patterns while also allowing me to work on areas that I want to improve upon within my mind. Additionally, the fact that it tailors its feedback to my specific gender and age is elegant - it's motivating to see how I stack up against others in my demographic. Overall, I'm finding it to be an inspiring experience."
5,Mikey from buffalo,"Honestly, I enjoy ranking in the top percentile because I‚Äôve always felt like I was little smarter than most people and these brain teasers confirm that. If you are like me and enjoy words of affirmation (even if they come from your own conscience) then you will love this app. It also helps you understand yourself better and your needs so that you can better your interpersonal relationships. Really cool self reflective app."
1,not worth my time1,"I believe that most 5 star reviews are either bots or made by the employees. Similar to almost every app made within the past few years, there is little to no use for it without paying for a subscription. You can do any test in the app but as soon as you want to see your test scores, you get hit with a pay wall. You cant even use the app without selecting ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù and then you get a notification of a charge from apple. I believe this app is just here to tell you what you already know but only after you pay for it. This app is definitely just a cash grab"
5,MadinWonderland,"I‚Äôve had long COVID for over a year and being in my late 40‚Äôs my memory wasn‚Äôt what it used to be before transacting COVID multiple times even though I had been vaccinated. This app helps me to sharpen my focusing, detail, and attention skills to improve the loss I‚Äôve encountered. Try it‚Ä¶you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs fun, helpful, and only takes a few minutes a day even though you‚Äôll always want more."
5,bractonre,Just trust me this game is amazing if your looking to kill time. It helps your concentration and at the same keeps you busy. It is not something that you can get super carried away either. The app has everything set up for you daily. It will be harder for you too waste any real world time compared to other games. It also has IQ tests and personality tests to inform you more about yourself.
5,gremlin.panda,"There‚Äôs a theory where if you spend a second mindfully getting all ur thoughts and energy out, you will be able to be more focused on any tasked you know you need to do. That‚Äôs what the app does for me. It‚Äôs kind of like micro learning. I read some reviews and some people have said it gets boring, but I think that‚Äôs also a good thing? It could be a good thing so you can get off ur phone and do ur work LOL"
5,Peteharold,"I have so much fun working with impulse. It‚Äôs so much fun that I forget that I‚Äôm doing BRAIN EXERCISES. I really appreciate the challenge and with conquering every puzzle I always feel a little accomplished and ready for the next.  Get this app. Pay for it. You‚Äôll find yourself wanting to spend more time with it in an addicting way that is far more healthy than IG, FB, or ANY of the social media or video platforms."
4,Malhu-cucurucu,"I‚Äôve had this app for over 2 months now, and playing these every day I‚Äôve mastered them pretty quickly. You guys should update the app constantly and change the games UPDATE the games, change them, add new games, change them, make them better, interesting, different, challenging. They are pretty much the same, even the math equations are the same! how are we supposed to improve or stay sharp with the same exercises over and over!"
1,bunchygerm,"At first looking at the ads for this actually seemed pretty good. I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting my brain to the test. Then you download the app. All they try to do is sign up for a subscription that isn‚Äôt cheap, they offer up a free trial hoping you forget about the subscription you signed up for once the trial expires. Even with the free trial it‚Äôs ad after ad after ad, even for puzzles that take literally under 10 seconds to solve. I‚Äôd rather go to a grocery store and buy a puzzle magazine with ads you can just turn the page on. If you have the app make sure you unsubscribe from the app. I‚Äôll be deleting right away"
5,PDPablo91,"I haven't quite incorporated Impulse into my daily routine but I am thoroughly enjoying my experience. The games are fun and I LOVE the quizzes! A chance to look inward and get to know myself better is always something I take the opportunity to do and Impulse provides many opportunities to do just that. Great app, I look forward to spending more time doing something productive while my phone is in my hands."
5,LinaRacer,"I really enjoy the games and puzzles, helps wake my brain up in the morning. There‚Äôs also quizzes that help you understand yourself a bit better! Only thing not too great about this app, is the membership price! Wish it was a bit more affordable. It‚Äôs a nice app, but not one I utilize everyday. Haven‚Äôt quite justified paying that price quite yet. Definitely worth checking out!"
5,Sommerovertherainbow,"Deleted social media a few days ago. Naturally by habit I am opening my phone only to remember doing so. Downloaded this in place in case I needed something to fill the time when I‚Äôm away from my book and I love it. Simple games, insightful surveys. Highly recommend just for boredom alone. Excited to see the benefits after a few weeks."
5,Jrell86,I like that impulse challenge me while helping to improve my brain. I only been using it for a few days and will edit reviews as often as possible to update on progress. One of the games I have to play to keep my streak going is not working. Really hope this is not a reoccurring problem because I have been dedicated to trying this app with an open mind.
4,":,o",The challenges it gives you are both fun and challenging. I think it‚Äôs really cool that it shows you the statistics of each challenge to show you how you can prove and so that you can strive to try be a better version of yourself. The only downside I would say is that you need to pay for quite a bit as there are many ads and if you do the tests you need to pay to get the full evaluation. Other than that I think it‚Äôs awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Material girls!,"This is a great app!!! I love that I get the opportunity to choose the subjects that I want to work on. If honestly makes me feel very calm and optimistic throughout the day. Although I do wish that I could have a option to go back and fix my mistakes in my work that I did, but in a way that is a good thing that I can‚Äôt too because I get to see where my brain started from and how it continues to grow! Overall this is truly a great app I really recommend!"
3,BKelly182,Overall I like the app and availability of games/puzzles to help sharpen your brain! BUT; there are WAY too many ads and the subscription is very costly. They do however offer an option to eliminate ads without the yearly subscription‚Ä¶or so I thought. I paid $4.99 and THEN found out that the $5 I just paid was only to cancel ads on ONE of the games‚Ä¶nothing else. Disappointed that that‚Äôs not advertised when you go to purchase because that‚Äôs also way to expensive and I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted my money.
5,Tori3022,"I have been playing mental mind games for a while and also trying to find an app that will challenge me. Impulse is worth while! I love the games, tests and the weekly reports. I like to know how I can improve and where I am doing better.   The only issue I have is during the tests, the timer doesn‚Äôt stop and begin between them. Hopefully, this can be resolved. Thank you."
5,Arias town,This game is for if you don‚Äôt want anyone or thing to bother you and very relaxing!!!I play this game once a day for 10 to 20 minutes and at the end I feel very satisfied and sometimes even smarter.I love the parts when you have to draw on line game and the puzzles üß© when you have to go in number order!!I have played this game for only a few days and already love it!!!!!
5,goblin_artistry,"It‚Äôs good for you and enjoyable? YES! I absolutely love this app and I may end up subscribing soon. It feels so good once I complete a game. It‚Äôs not like other apps where I‚Äôll feel drained after or overstimulated, I truly feel like I‚Äôve accomplished a brain workout. I‚Äôm starting to have my father who suffers from Parkinson‚Äôs, play some games as well. He‚Äôs really doing well and having fun while exercising necessary parts of his brain!"
5,kayla2225,"My mother and I both use this, and have been training out brains for a while. The games are fun, but it definitely makes a difference, because especially my attention span has gotten better in school, since I started  using this application. I definitely recommend. If you‚Äôre looking for a brain training game, this is the one for you!"
5,blue eied baby,"I had brain surgery in 2021 for my seizures. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research and self help books to keep my brain working strong. By far this app has me hooked, and has shown me the area‚Äôs that I need to work harder on. One of the hidden gems in this app give‚Äôs steps some ideas to try and build yourself in my (case) I also work with my doctor‚Äôs too. Overall this app has been great for me!!"
5,zhikimm,"1. I‚Äôm always looking for little fun puzzle games but get quickly bored of playing the same game and puzzles over and over again which honestly most games on my phone last maybe a week before I ever open it again, this one is great because you always get a new game!  2. Challenges increase based on your own ability to complete so it won‚Äôt get too difficult too quick but for games you excel at they will increase the difficulty for that single game.  3. You can go in after daily challenges and play levels on any game you enjoy.  4. They are all games that will help with mental status, increasing multiple different regions of your brain and can be adjusted to however you want."
5,lilchiclen,"Hi! I am 13 years old and I am always looking for a fun way to grow my mind! this game is actually so much fun and really interesting! i always play it before a test and oh my gosh it calms me down and helps me so much, i really have been scoring higher. not too many ads, and I have the free version. at the begining of the app they give u a quiz on what u want to improve on and ur age, so it's great for everybody!! i love it please try it!"
1,mchlnrvs,"The app is fine but all the games here can be found in the App Store for free, probably with ads. I hit the trial and got charged a subscription. I reached out to the company and they responded ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt handle refunds, apple does‚Äù and a link that shows you that it cannot be refunded. Just annoying that app is so basic and I got scammed. Brain Age on the ds was the original game that did it much better and of course you would just pay once. The company is Definitely banking on the fact that ppl will click a link, go to download and hit the side button for the trial and then get charged."
4,ecruRabbit,"After utilizing the free trial period for Impulse, I had NO doubt that it was worth the purchase price. If you enjoy puzzles and brain games, you need to try the app that conveniently houses all the different kinds of brain teasers and brain training exercises in one easy to use package.  Like any other body part, the brain needs working out too, and this app employees so many different types of mental challenges and problem to solve, it's like cross-training for your brain."
5,TheMostPulp,"This game has tons of fun components and I‚Äôm training my brain while having fun! The games are styled after popular app games so instead of downloading all these games then abandoning them in my phone when I get sick of them, I can just have fun on this app! I never knew training your brain could be so fun! I love seeing my progress over time and overall my brain has been working better!"
5,Aubrey. M,"Okay so the game gives you different options to play different games! Even if you have finished all of the activities that you needed to complete, it still allows you to continue playing for as long as you wish! You still do have to pay some price for the program, it is still a very enjoyable app and it is actually very fun!"
5,SuperHeartDogGirl,"This app gives you specialized help in whatever your reason for getting the app was. Even if you don‚Äôt buy their membership, there‚Äôs still enough for you to keep your brain sharp daily and improve on a couple of focus areas on your brain. It also tells you exactly how each game is helping you. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for brain games!"
5,tom_thehawk,"It‚Äôs difficult for me to be challenged. Impulse is providing that for me in fun, adaptable, intelligence building ways! The games are progressively stimulating, and with the quick instruction video, I can be clear on how to play before the game engages. It shows how I compared to other users at the end of my challenges which keeps me interested in playing because we all know, that ‚ÄúI‚Äù have to be the best."
5,**Reggie**0192,"It‚Äôs very fun and is very helpful especially for growing minds and is also just a good way to get your mind off things and keep you calm. I love puzzles myself and this game is full of them every time I open the app i am playing a new puzzle. It helps with your spelling and helps you get better at patterns and different kinds of puzzles, and keeps your mind young and smart. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Jack j p,"It‚Äôs great, except‚Ä¶  When doing various things, after completing them, a message comes up saying ‚ÄúRestoring Your Progress‚Äù, which blocks your ability to navigate the app. It comes up repeatedly, and is annoying. It should be changed so that this message only appears in the background, or not at all, since it‚Äôs entirely unnecessary."
3,Unhappy_2924,I hate writing reviews. But I am because your cancellation process is very well hidden!   I downloaded the app on May 11th to give it a try using the 3-day trial option. I used it for a day.  But couldn‚Äôt figure out how to cancel my subscription using the in app feature until May 13th at 11 pm at which point I was already charged the weekly subscription fee!! It‚Äôs only $7 and change but I am disappointed at how hard it was to cancel my subscription.
1,sessional65,"I finally cracked and got the app after seeing it all over my social medias. I was excited to take some test and do the training as they reminded me of the brain training games I would play as a kid. What really grabbed my attention was the tests, so I accepted the free trial and decided to take an archetype test. Only to find out I couldn‚Äôt get any information without paying. While the app seems good the developers are obviously not as bought in as they would like their customers to be. For anyone on the fence and wanting to test their product, don‚Äôt bother unless you‚Äôre willing to buy yourself through the paywall"
2,Macklunatic,In the two days i have played/worked on this cognitive stimulate i honestly say my creative side of my brain started up and has been on ideal. That has not stared up in years and it feels good to draw again. On the other side my common sense or simple task side has gone to lunch and took off the rest of the day to go play golf in the rain. Or maybe that side has been like that for some time and never acknowledged. Either way i scored a 1225 on strange signals outperforming 99% of the population and lets just say i scored a perfect 100% on the dam thing. Beat that. Elon musk!!!
5,the1onlyprime,"I love this app because it requires focus, awareness and actual problem solving. Even more amazing than this is the fact that over time having to solve certain puzzles or problems actually makes facing real life problem solving scenarios seem easier. Thinking outside of the box is something that is needed and definitely helps reduce the stress that originates from problematic situations."
4,Ayreq,"Unsure what caused failure. did hitting a wrong tile spell failure, or should you just go on from where you were hitting the correct one next? It appeared to me and some of the later ones as though a whole bunch of tiles that I had clicked correctly reappeared. I I realized immediately that I had hit an incorrect tile, but were the ones that I reappeared ones that had been somehow missed in between a pair or watt. I just don‚Äôt know. Hope this helps."
5,Human from nowhere,It helps me a lot from the first day l played it was great but sometimes it‚Äôs to hard for me. But that‚Äôs why it making people progress in mind and focus. It‚Äôs a good for children sometimes it talk and bills and stuff but it‚Äôs good for everyone. I left a good review because l trust in this game and more like this game is good for people in general. I hope this game grows and help more people make stuff like this. Have a good day everyone.
5,Mew/power4,"This app has been great fun so far. I e only been doing my daily exercises for 2 days, but in that time I have had fun and feel more confident that I am taking care of my brain health. I have Rheumatoid Disease and it has affecting so much more than my joints, memory being one of them, and I pray this app helps me with that. After playing for awhile, I will leave another update on what I think."
5,Betseymills,I like impulse in my opinion because it makes my brain work hard and keep its state that‚Äôs best. But some of the impulse games are not as more skill building more about fun. It‚Äôs ok to have fun a lot. but people that download this want to see how much there brain improves. Not how much fun they have. And when I‚Äôm playing I want to improve my brain and keep my mindset. And if you improve this thank you a lot.
5,Neois_,"Saw this app just randomly scrolling and enjoyed it ever since. All that‚Äôs given without subscription and the length of ads, it‚Äôs all perfect and just an amazing application overall. From the design to attention to simplicity, and also overall use and helpfulness. It‚Äôs something I wish I had for a long time already and overall hope to be using it for a long time!"
5,kkyylleeaa,"I actually didn‚Äôt mean to purchase a year subscription of this, but it‚Äôs actually really fun!  Super quick games to get your brain going & they are actually entertaining. I have ADHD & do not take my medicine, yet this keeps my attention for at least 30 minutes to an hour every day.   I‚Äôm 24, but this is useful for any age. App is very easy to navigate too!! Highly recommend :)"
1,Eminico,"I wanted to give it a try because I wanted to see if I could do the drawing activity in the advertisement. Before I could try the app, I had to pick a subscription choice that would activate after the 3 day trial.  Well, I downloaded the App and played a day‚Äôs worth. Decided it wasn‚Äôt for me. Went to my Apple subscriptions and there is no way to cancel the trial. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, I already got notification from my payment method that they requested the money for the subscription.  Now I have to deal with Apple to figure out how to cancel the trial and not get the subscription charged. There‚Äôs no way to cancel the trial, so just don‚Äôt download until they fix it."
5,Kttymari,"I really enjoy impulse! Since using it I‚Äôve seen improvements in my memory, especially with remembering numbers. My favorite game is Candy Sort, I get such a sense of accomplishment once all of the candies are sorted! The individual brain training is great because it tailors learning to your needs. Overall great app if used only for the games or if you want to do some brain training too!"
5,Pastor DaNova,As a Christian Minister I always seek tools to help our particular group focus as to live richer lives. GOD CONT to Bless the makers of this app that I personal use and sense and experience significant mental growth. Along with other apps this is a great way to quickly stay in line with other serious individuals that want to be conscious within there own existence. Don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶.lol‚Ä¶ read here to stay focused on salvation:‚ù§Ô∏èJohn 3:16‚ù§Ô∏è  Pastor CTAL: Carlos ‚ÄúDaNova‚Äù Villanueva Cort√©s Founder Conscious Culture NOW!
5,SpeedyBlurr,When it‚Äôs been some time since you‚Äôve taken math classes or reading/writing classes and you don‚Äôt use them often you might lose faith in your ability to do these things. If you don‚Äôt use them you lose them. This helps me feel more confident in my abilities to do these things and it definitely helps me think quicker on my feet.
5,N3|_|R0,"I purchased this app as a personal developmental tool. It is one of the most well designed applications for testing, learning, and improving all mental capabilities and skills. It is applicable to almost every aspect of life. It will set you and anyone you share it with for success. This is a recommended one for child development and development in general. Love this platform! Keep up the good work."
5,GlambitionBeautyMUA,I have short term memory loss due to a brain injury and I‚Äôm always so frustrated with how bad my memory has become.  Downloading this app and giving it a try has been a pleasant & welcome surprise honestly!  I thought it would be something to kill time with but it‚Äôs already truly helping me and keeping my brain thinking which in turn is helping my memory.  Highly recommend!
4,Happy temp,"Hi. The app was interesting to help me with short term and long term memory. I chose challenging level and each test says I‚Äôve ranked between 80 and 95 percent above my peers. It‚Äôs nice to think that‚Äôs true I guess.. but I know it‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs why I want to use the app. My suggestion would be t make the challenging level harder so we keep thinking we need the app. I‚Äôm going to subscribe be , likely the tests will get harder as I go and‚Ä¶ practice is practice :) thank ya to the developers"
5,Crash 1972,"It‚Äôs actually quite fun and entertaining. The fact that I am benefiting from doing these games, challenges and puzzles is awesome. It‚Äôs all about neuroplasticity for me. It‚Äôs helping. Slowly but surely, it‚Äôs making a difference for me. Plus, I just enjoy it, and I‚Äôm not one to like let alone bother doing ‚Äústupid‚Äù little games.  It definitely rocks! Didn‚Äôt think I was going to actually enjoy it!"
5,yankeedoodle777,"This app is very useful.  Has lots of different types of games to choose from. Daily and monthly training to help keep your mind sharp in many areas. Free play, so you can play what ever game when ever you‚Äôd like. Personally I paid the whole $25 for the year subscription and have played for almost a month now‚Ä¶ have noticed a bit of a difference in my memory capacity"
2,Liuli79,"I DID love this game. ‚ÄúDID.‚Äù I was happily playing, really doing well, asked for a clue, my clues ran out but I accidentally clicked on the cue button only to be taken to some app in the App Store that it was telling me to download. A completely unrelated app that looked cheap and pointless. I couldn‚Äôt come back out of it. I tried going back in to the Impulse app and every time it just took me to this stupid game in the App Store telling me to download with no other option. I have to uninstall the whole Impulse app now which will lose all my info. Not sure I‚Äôll bother reinstalling. VERY annoying!"
5,Nate88_2004,"This is a quality group of intelligent games that are good for your mind to test your skills, sharpen your thinking, and just have fun.   I love seeing how I do compared to others and compared to my previous scores. This does a great job at both.   I am sick of all the fake, click bait apps out there. The ads are rarely as they advertise. Nice to find one that does what it says and does it well."
5,nurseluvjust,I have been using impulse daily for about a year now‚Ä¶ and I can tell how much it had helped me retrain myself and become sharper‚Ä¶ I make it my goal for  increase my high score in at least one activity a day!! And it gets hard‚Ä¶ but eventually you get it!! And the next time it‚Äôs not as hard!!! I hated math.. even simple math‚Ä¶ but now I can do % off the top of my head!!
5,Brii tii,"I enjoy this game very much. It‚Äôs actually helped me realize that there are things I can do a little better than I thought and that with a little bit of concentration, I can do more than I allow myself to do. It‚Äôs very fun. It keeps you on your toes. There‚Äôs a little timer but at the end of the day you‚Äôre not being tested it‚Äôs just to help your brain stay sharp."
3,Razrrow,"So this might be an apple issue. Apps need to clearly state family or not. Can‚Äôt for the life of me why a developer wouldn‚Äôt want it to be family sharing. Its marketing 101, give a little gain a lot. But some never figured this out..  but love the app, wish I could share with my fam, too much $$ not that important.. but thats the developers‚Äô problem.  My kids won‚Äôt pay for this, but there friends might, but they will never know. Update family settings and it just might benefit you."
2,tee carrier,This and a few other apps indicate that they will be a free experience when the purchase option is just GET with no indication that an in-app purchase will be required. The idea of this app is awesome and I wanted to have a few trials to experience what it may be but I was never allowed that moment. Upon launch you are flowed through an introduction and options to set your interactions‚Äîthe glitch is the pay option after that walk-through which was not indicated at the surface level within the store. This deception should not be allowed.
5,awarren,"Having terrible insomnia, often leads to lots of mindless internet surfing. Until that is, I found IMPLUSE. Now I use this app to improve my mind and the speed to which I understand and react to things. I can actually feel an improvement in my cognitive abilities and motor skills. I love this APP...IMPLUSE is fun, fast and good for my mind! So much better than mindfulness surfing. Thanks to the creators, a job well done!"
5,Playgamer1225,"Impulse is a great game to play during the summer. It keeps your brain sharp and allows you to have fun while you‚Äôre doing it. My family goes on vacation during the summer and the car rides can be up to 12 hours so having a game like this is great, not to mention all of the mental stuff it helps with. Overall it is a great way to get ready for school during the summer."
5,Jacob Ali,"Having the strongest brain on earth, after I suffering the worst injury in the history of humanity, 11 brain blood clots, when no one has ever surved more then 7 brain blood clots and they ended up blind, paralyzed, and unable to talk. This app significanly helps keeps my brain sharp and healthy  After suffering such an injury, this app is helping bring back nearly all the memory ive forgotten!"
5,SeveruxDWarlock,"When you decide to get the membership or the subscription for it, you're money will be well spent. At the start of each puzzle it may seem like its very easy and even a trained monkey can do it, wait until you reach a higher level then you will feel the challenge and will force your brain to work more than the usual in a good way."
5,mkr1993,"I have a lot of gray matter apparently from extensive Adderall use for over 10 years. I take tons of supplements now which help little, so it wasn‚Äôt until I started using my brain from this brain training game that I started having things click faster which has, subsequently, increased my dopamine levels. Which has made me a much happier person."
5,Raeb404,"I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I got this game. I was just bored and saw an ad for it and decided to try it. However, it my second day playing it and I honestly love it. There are so many different games and it‚Äôs so fun trying to do well. It‚Äôs the perfect game for someone who gets bored easily because even with my short attention span I‚Äôve gotten pretty hooked to the game!"
5,The sus dude,"This game is addictive at some levels, and Impulse is improving your mind with every game you play! Very addictive, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can improve reaction speed, memory, focus, cognitive flexibility, visual processing speed, creativity, problem solving, decision making, brain processing speed, and much, much more. I would suggest every parent give this to their kids!"
3,Psyclorama,"I have experienced few apps that come for your coin quite as insidiously as this one. ""Want an IQ test report? Subscribe! Don't want to subscribe? How about a one time discount purchase? ARE YOU SURE?!"" Never seen an app push notify you (and I'm pretty sure I didn't accept notifications) after you cancel the subscription and ask for feedback. But cancelling is just one of many ways to get a >90% discount if you're willing to sign up for a whole year. The games are fun, if you can ignore the grubby asks."
5,weatern girl,You‚Äôd think there would just be boring tests but no! There are three games that are assigned each day. I do mine in the morning so I can get my brain ready for the day. And after that you can pick! There are also tests but they aren‚Äôt all boring and you don‚Äôt have to do them. You can see which side of your brain is dominate. This is a very great app. You should definitely try it out.
5,BPT422,"You see ads all the time for games that are nothing like the ad, or are poorly made. Impulse is hands-down the best ‚Äúgame‚Äù out there. Actually, it‚Äôs the best suite of games. It has more games, tests, and mind-sharpening , fast-paced exercises then I had thought when I first purchased it. Impulse is a life changer. It‚Äôs fun and useful all at the same time. Thank you to the folks who made Impulse!"
5,jefrika,"I enjoy this app a lot. I like that the games make me think but they are still fun. I like the daily challenges and how they switch every day to exercise different parts of my brain, I do wish there were more variety  for the daily challenges!   I really love candy sort most of all.  The tests are also very interesting and help me learn a lot about myself"
2,nicknamenumbertwelve,"I recently purchased the year long account with this app because I enjoyed it.  However I recently accidentally signed out of the app and cannot sign back in. It continues to tell me my account doesn‚Äôt exist, but they had no problems billing my card linked to the Apple account.  I reached out to the contact email address that‚Äôs listed weeks ago and have never heard back.  Willing to change my rating if someone could actually help me. Otherwise don‚Äôt get the subscription, you won‚Äôt get your moneys worth."
5,whitwhit1128,This is by far my favorite brain training app I‚Äôve ever used the interface is beautiful and the way it shows you how you rank compared to other people on your level is really interesting I will definitely continue using this app and also recommend it to all of my friends and family even my kids like to play these games.
4,T.S.2001,"I just started this app this week, I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. The only change I would have is the upgrade to receive all information provided. It is about $30 for the year, with the sale they offered. Some people don‚Äôt have the money and some don‚Äôt want to spend that much. I am one of those people who wouldn‚Äôt want to spend that much. But other than that, the app has been great."
5,FakeReveiws,"I haven‚Äôt paid for the subscription, but I can still take the IQ test, when I finished, it shows the different ways you can pay for a subscription to get ‚Äúthe full report.‚Äù But, at the top it gives me an IQ score and a classification. My question is, is the score it say my score? Or is it just an example of what the subscription would look like?"
1,Mr. Iceray,"Must say I didn‚Äôt really think I‚Äôd enjoy this game nor, did I think it would hold my attention for long. But it has truly been an eye opening experience for me. It has help me to see in just a few games where my weaknesses are. When it it come to short, visual, and even mathematical states are. Love this game already began telling others about it. At fist I also must say that I didn‚Äôt think I should have to pay for this help, but again I must confess it‚Äôs a small price for a great return. Thanks again Impulse. What a great variety of challenges you‚Äôve created here for the brain to expand and grow."
2,fibonocci8,The free version has LONG ads (10+ seconds) after EVERY game and sometimes two in a row. Tries to annoy you to the point of paying to remove ads just for that game but not for all. Places the close ad button in small and tricky places that makes you open the ad. Your frustratingly trying to get back to the game every time. App has a gross and money leechy feel to it. Better apps out there like Elevate and Lumosity whose free versions are limited but don‚Äôt actively try to annoy you into payment and ruin the user experience.
5,fat duty,I think this help a a little because when you are timed to do certain things you realize just how fast or slow your mind works on certain categories I found myself doing a great job in something I thought I would fail because I never been good at it before but turns out it wasn‚Äôt all that bad just need to focus.
5,mfiaprincess22,I love the fact that it‚Äôs a challenge me mentally !and they make it fun n competitive with a timer . They inform you of your score by correct n incorrect answers plus give you a percentage of your score out of a 100. The game also tutoring one time with every level so u don‚Äôt have a incomplete test score ‚Ä¶like they say if you if you don‚Äôt use it you lose it !
1,Jj0721,"Unfortunately, I really couldn‚Äôt even get a good sense of how well this app worked due to the ads. They make you watch ads that are terribly long, and even when they‚Äôre over you still have to watch them again or wait an extended time to close them. A number of times even after I waited for the ad to end, the screen just blacked out and I couldn‚Äôt even play the next game. And it happens between every exercise. I get that with these game‚Äôs developers need to be paid, but this is just ridiculous. They make it almost unusable to the point of paying for it. No thanks."
5,adhd34,I have adhd with a iq of 130 this helps me focus when I‚Äôm not interested in what I‚Äôm doing while I follow the things I love as much as possible reality doesn‚Äôt work that way and as adults we have to do things we are not interested in impulse helps me preform at my highest level by providing me with the challenges I need to improve on the areas that I struggle with and helps me with games to keep my wits sharp
4,Abbyant70,"I like this app, I really like that they put thought into allowing each participant to tailor the app goals. For example, you can choose how long you want to play, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. The games are interesting and I do feel that they challenge my mind in a way that helps improve my memory and attention.     Just be careful about the free trial.  The phrasing is a bit confusing.  I deleted the game because of it."
5,-pointhisout,I downloaded this because I saw it on TickTock and it seems fun and I‚Äôve been playing it for about an hour and I‚Äôm at level 16. It‚Äôs very addicting and you can play cool brain games. And also you can make your brain sharper. I like this game because it‚Äôs is not like Fortnite or Roblox or those games that you can addict to and it would it be healthy. Although this game makes your brain sharper and it‚Äôs fun!
5,DragoHasTheFire,"Honestly thought this was gonna be another pay for subscription and take tests app. Which it is, until I saw the life time pay once offer and I can say I like the app so far. The games do get harder as the you continue to play them. Plus there are few things you can find out about yourself through the series of tests they have."
2,spencer775,"I saw an ad for this app. I clicked through to check it out. The free trial allows you one day of ‚Äúgames/tests‚Äù after that you with have to watch long ads on each test or buy the premium for like 6 or 7 bucks a month.   I completed the first and second days and a few extra games. They were interesting, but certainly not worth buying a full version of the app on a subscription basis. Please before you ask for 4 bucks a month less than Netflix. Provide something that has at least 1/10th of its value.   I would not recommend this app at its current pricing."
5,Gloopy poop,"I‚Äôm honestly not great at using the app daily (although the push notifications are great reminders), but I love it. Being multi-neurodivergent, it really helps me get my brain working in ways it sometimes struggles to, and generally helps me feel like I‚Äôm using different parts of my brain than I‚Äôm used to on a daily basis. 10/10 recommend (esp for fellow neurospicy burritos)"
5,Palm woman,"These have not been proven to improve cognitive ability in a significant way, but they are such fun and exercise such a different parts of the brain that it seems like there is certainly useful, especially compared with playing FreeCell, and the other game that I play exhaustively I am so delightful to have found these. Even the aged cognitive brain instructor agrees that these are worth checking out."
5,Anime_Boi_,"I originally saw this in an ad from another app, and I thought it looked alright, so I‚Äôd try it. I ended up enjoying it so much, I subscribed! I love the interface, and the fact that there are so many different tests. The app also tells you what you are working when it comes to mental skills like processing data or writing. I love this app and likely won‚Äôt stop!"
5,kittyplayer44_2009,"This is one of the best apps to stay on track and track your progress on everything from problem solving to mental math to even helping with anxiety, they have fun games to help with everything and helps you stay focused on fun learning I definitely recommend this app if you want to get better in daily life or just see how well you are currently doing."
5,AMBERSMe,"Great Way to Remember What‚Äôs Important in Life.  Simple tasks, games, puzzles to help anyone to feel more content and happy!  :) There‚Äôs always room for improvement.  Education is key, and practice makes perfect.   You can give your feedback about how the games could improve, as well if you want to.  Which, is pretty cool.  You do not have to be a genius to know What‚Äôs up!   It‚Äôs All Good. ‚úîÔ∏è"
5,OCD ICB RN,"If you find yourself addicted to mindless scrolling through short form media and want to stop‚Ä¶ try this app. Set a timer for 20 minutes and do these brain games instead of scrolling, then move onto your next task.   Only suggestion‚Ä¶ for the memory games, try images that have more distinct shapes and colors. Unfair to those with poorer eyesight to have so many similar objects."
4,joe momma_hahaha,"It helps, when you first start it asks you questions and answering them right helps them to know what games for you. And there are so many things I love, one of them giving you tests that helps to see and know what kind of person you are, but one thing I don‚Äôt like is you have to pay, but it says choose a payment plan but you don‚Äôt have to. I have been playing for awhile know and haven‚Äôt spent a single penny."
5,mynamehasbeentale,"They took me from my home, fed me dog food and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt write this review and give it five stars you‚Äôll be learning from books again!‚Äù. I cried and begged, pleading for mercy to no avail. This game is wonderful! I love it very much. I‚Äôve been using it for a day and already i can feel the neural pathways opening up inside of me :D. My mind has expanded thank you to these God blessed creators. May mercy be in their hearts. Amen üôè"
5,ImaProphet,"I think exercising the brain is something everyone can benefit from, regardless of age, but even more important as we age & retire from our career. This app makes it really easy to do and fun to boot! I like the challenges to improve and the instant rewards and feedback. I also like the daily reminders to be consistent and the variety of exercises that keep it fresh. I highly recommend it!!"
3,dreamerx22,"Was on my free trial of premium and won a discount as a prize. It was not set up in a way to be clear that activating that now negated your free trial and charged you for the purchase. When I went to cancel it would let me cancel for a year from now. I‚Äôm sure I can go through the hassle of contacting support and fight it, but I do like the game and am just frustrated that it feels purposely set up to have you cancel your free trial and commit to purchase without being clear that that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. Be careful!"
5,Toshwy,"I like this kind of quick game. The science is unproven about if it delays brain aging, but these types of things seemed to have improved my reaction times and memory. And this app - still new for me - is fun with lots of games ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt crash or misbehave. And the paid option is less expensive than some others - with more games. What not  to love?"
5,mutualrespect8*,"So far IMPULSE is pretty cool. I‚Äôm somewhat surprised by the outcome of some, thinking ü§î ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm better than I thought ‚Äú or ‚Äúdang, I thought I was better‚Äù but I can see only good in the out come of this app. I‚Äôm going to switch up to the year payment plan because I feel it‚Äôs worth it, and hey, it‚Äôs a much better deal. Way to go IMPULSE!! I think it would be wonderful for people who have TBI‚Äôs."
5,XYZ4814MoonBeam,"I enjoy playing impulse , it helps to tone down and distract my brain anytime I‚Äôm feeling anxious out panicked. This app is so wonderful especially with the other subjects and materials it provides not only to learn about yourself but to train your brain with actually fun games all while having a very user friendly interface."
4,Exercise your brain man,I just started so everything seems to be elementary to me. I understand the concept for why this was created in the first place which is great but as for now it seems too basic. Maybe as I continue to keep playing and exercising and growing to more levels it would be a bit more challenging which hopefully would make me really have to start putting my brain to use. We‚Äôll see
5,louisem1234,I‚Äôve been using this app every day for three weeks.  There is definitely improvement in my cognition. I‚Äôve realized that late night is not the time to play these games even if I have insomnia. I am not as quick thinking when I am tired. I‚Äôm 59 and I want to keep a sharp mind so now I retire early and use the app in the at afternoon. Use it-  it really helps!
3,ssoheilmn,"Could you please fix the app so the Today tab doesn‚Äôt keep showing the same games every day? I‚Äôve been playing all 3-5 recommended games in the Today tab for over a month, but it‚Äôs been recommending me from only 5 to 8 of the games. Can you allow users to fully randomize recommendations in that tab, or swap games to avoid monotony? I want to keep my strike, but also some days I don‚Äôt feel to play some of the games again and again."
1,JohnColeB,"Cut to the chase. I spent a handful of minutes answering questions to attempt to give the app a whirl. Once you‚Äôve invested time, that‚Äôs when you get locked into payment options. You can‚Äôt see what the app has to offer or what it is about before donating a minimum of $5. What a shame, or not, no one will ever know. Don‚Äôt waste your time as I have already done that for you. Room for improvement: maybe add a video to give a quick demonstration of what the app has to offer before requesting money. No one minds paying for apps but at least give us an idea of what we‚Äôre getting into."
5,ShaNahNah's,"Through the change of life, I found I need to sharpen my mind. I hoped this would help. I feel many times I am just mindlessly on my phone. I found this App is revealing areas in my mind  that are not as sharp as they used to be. It is helping while ‚Äúplaying games.‚Äù It is very enjoyable with lots of variety. I feel it‚Äôs revealing deficiencies and is helping."
5,jdhdhdjdo,"For exampleWhen you‚Äôre having the urge to poker prod at me or speak to me, this is a perfect app to play on especially if you‚Äôre needing to use the bathroom because you‚Äôll be going to the bathroom the same time I‚Äôm going to the bathroom I would imagine especially the way that everything is built in my world. I would suggest this app to everyone."
5,Mama Ruth,"Right away I‚Äôm noticing areas I‚Äôm strong with and areas that are more challenging for me. The games are quick. The results are formatted in meaningful comparison ways that don‚Äôt feel judgemental, rather simply neutral feedback. I appreciate that aspect a lot. I‚Äôm committed to a daily practice for the next month to see what happens. 5 minutes a day for a fun brain training is an easy commitment to make."
5,Spoiled_okie,I had my doubts but this app actually does make you use your brain in ways you might not with normal routines of home and work.  It‚Äôs fun to challenge yourself to get 100%‚Ä¶and you have to be quick and pay attention.  I like this app a lot and definitely give it 5 stars.  It will adjust to your level to keep you on your toes! :)
5,MsAriesDiamond,"Impulse help me so much after my car accident, I didn't realize how much an concussion effect my everyday life. So I had to find help to gain more control of things I've lost control of unwilling. To see the low levels and how much how I have gain over one week is amazing. A tearful Thank you to the creators for this super experience that change my life for the better!!!"
5,Measured Madness,Some brain training apps have you doing the same thing over and over again but not this one! This one keeps you guessing and I love that. I feel like it engages different areas of your brain in one session. There‚Äôs been a noticeable improvement in my immediate recollection. As long as you put in the work you will see the results.
5,Mlxdi,"Unlike most games in the app store, this actually helps you build yoyrself up. Moat of the games are really fun.  I would like to request better word games though. It would be amazing if this app also helped one build up their vocabulary by teaching them new words. Currently, the word games just use words and phrases you already know. I‚Äôd love a vocab builder in this app."
3,arykabrel,"i love the game. been looking for something relaxing like this for a while!   HOWEVER. i should be able to get through more than two little puzzles without a 30 second ad between them. it‚Äôs just a little ridiculous! should not have to pay $50 to remove that either. you make it so annoying to get more money out of your customers, and that‚Äôs very frustrating."
5,Dream Digital,I downloaded this app thinking I can just delete it if it‚Äôs not helpful like they say. I liked it immediately and bought the year subscription because I knew this was something that would be useful in my life. It took me less than a day to be excited to reenter the app and to know I did NOT want to delete it like I planned prior!
5,Mrgiovannibland,I am a 43 yr old who hasn‚Äôt been in school for some time but training within any position I‚Äôve had has always been a must. I was looking for a way to have some homework. A way aside from a conventional video game to refocus my brain in stress. Relief. This is definitely it. I‚Äôm challenged in a way that feels more responsible and still having fun while passing time
5,Booman36210,"As someone who never stops working and going to school.... THIS IS GREAT. Not that I've been diagnosed professionally, but I believe I do show slight signs of ADHD (forgetfulness, disorganization,etc.) IT HELPS WITH THAT I SWEAR. Get into a habit of doing the three games every day early in the morning and you'll slowly start to see yourself perform better throughout the day. It's actually crazy how it all works! Try it out!"
1,Ronbon710,"The games are so cool & I enjoyed the app alot (briefly) but I just can‚Äôt with these full minute of the same ducking add over and over every 5 seconds. Plus having to jump thru so many hoops to play anything bc it‚Äôs constantly trying to get you to buy the full version. Can I just try this shot for a week before deciding to pay $30-$50 for a stupid phone app? If you want any test results, expect to pay 5-8$ each for them if you don‚Äôt sign up for the full thing. It‚Äôs more frustrating than helpful at this point. Ended up deleting after 2 days"
5,mathgenius09,"This app is great. It has everything to offer about your brain. What your General IQ is, what personality type your are, what side brained you are and so much more. There are SOME ads but barely any that would make a person mad. I really enjoy this app personally because I have ADHD and it helps me with my social skills and my mental skills such us memory and mental maths. Overall, great app and I love it!"
5,Sheilabeen,"I like this app a lot more than other apps in the App Store for brain training. The graphics are more entertaining, which helps to keep me engaged in the tasks presented to me. The games are also quite cute and keep me entertained as well as engaged with performing well. I wish that this was an app that was a little bit cheaper to use."
2,rosemaryash,"I just downloaded the app to take tests like the archetype test or personality test. I spent 15 minutes thoughtfully answering 72 questions, only to get to the end and find out that you have to pay to see your results. I don‚Äôt want to do a free trial because I know I won‚Äôt use the app a ton all at once, but just from time to time when I‚Äôm relaxing on a weekend. I really wish they would be clear about what‚Äôs free and what requires payment and not trick you into taking the whole test without showing results."
5,Mrs Britz,"I downloaded, I played for a bit, I stayed for a bit, went on with my evening. The next day, I initiated work I had been avoiding for months: website work. I think that the experience of the small, bite-sized exercises caused me to see how to work with my web app tools as my partners, instead of seeing the tools as mocking, counterintuitive aggressors within my task."
5,TinoDragon007/11,"I like this app a lot. It teaches me great things and keeps my brain üß† trained, improved and refreshed. Yes, I smoke cigarettes sometimes, which is not good for me, but this app helps a lot and gives me something to do when I am bored just wasting my life away! So thank you team for Impulse ‚ù§Ô∏è! And hey üëã, maybe I‚Äôll stop smoking cigarettes after all, for that is what your app is inspiring me to do. I know this is an act of self-love."
5,Yehshecrazy so!,"I‚Äôve just started playing‚Ä¶ And so far so good. It actually makes me think and do things that I normally wouldn‚Äôt even think about, but I can tell it‚Äôs very helpful and most importantly it‚Äôs fun and good for me (for my brain). I am of the older persuasion, so it‚Äôs absolutely important that I do things to continuously stimulate my mind. So far I have found just the game to do this‚Ä¶loving it so far."
5,Rustyr30281,"I used Lumosity for a couple of years, paying an annual fee. I didn‚Äôt really get much insight and seemed to hit an unbeatable plateau. So, I switched to Impulse. This app is not only more informative, offering deeper insights than what I was used to, the games are fun, engaging, and descriptive. Impulse also offers a lifetime membership, so no more annual fees.   I highly recommend this app for daily brain training."
5,AlabamaRadio,I had a stroke 4 years ago so I‚Äôm always looking for games to play to get my brain working in ways it may have forgotten and just trying to keep my mind fresh. I love this game because it shows what your working on in your brain with each game and the games are enjoyable to play. It‚Äôs actually an app that I don‚Äôt feel guilty for having.
5,foolayjones,"Just the simple fact of wanting to check the status of my mindset on this app instead of being on social media all the time is a great feeling. It sends out the same brain stimulation as social media, but ima actually learning and growing my mind in the short time that I‚Äôm using the app. I love it and would fully recommend this app to anyone.."
5,VicktasticRose,I just got my iPhone and haven‚Äôt really had the time to download some apps and this popped up that it‚Äôs good for my mental health so I had to try it out and I don‚Äôt regret it what‚Äôs so ever. It keeps my brain so focus and instead of getting distracted and thinking about other things. It definitely a most recommended. Plus I‚Äôm autistic so I got told it‚Äôs also a good app for that too.
5,The_Serj,I struggle from ADHD these games encourage me and make me feel more comfortable making decisions and helps my cognitive abilities and functionality in my daily task and work. I‚Äôm currently in progress of getting a new certification this application has helped with my focus and studying and please continue to perfect this app
5,unsweet black mango,So far the app is really good. Playing the free version as they do ask you to buy the app at a discounted price which im assuming has more games and advantages to it. It is a good relaxing game that has you doing multiple things so you are not bored. Definitely a brain worker and i like that. It gets harder as you go along. At the moment I would definitely recommend.
5,1CrazyMechanic,So I was hesitant as usual to try any kind of cognitive brain app but let me tell you that Impulse is absolutely enjoyable and it helps sharpen your mind just enough every day. And best of all this all sharpens your mind with fun interactive games and gives you your statistical scores at the end to help you understand where you stand in comparison to your peers. I absolutely love this app.
5,N.Cruz :),"I don‚Äôt know how but I am glad they have this thing of making the subscription price cheaper!!! I somehow seem to love this app! It has fun, but challenging brain games and you know you worked out your brain if it starts to hurt. The game just does that! So I recommend getting the subscription so then you can have the best brain training experience!"
4,dovzinia,"This Brain training app is really great for giving your mind a workout. They have all sorts of fun games and activities that help improve your memory, focus, and problem-solving skills. Using this apps regularly can keep your brain sharp and flexible. I'm really impressed by this app! They don't bombard you with ads constantly. I get that they need to make money from the free version, so I don't really mind waiting for the ads to finish."
5,Tori Roos,"I downloaded this from a TikTok ad and unlike all the other ones I downloaded before I actually loved this one and didn‚Äôt uninstall it!!! Im be had it since Saturday ( it‚Äôs Thursday rn) and I‚Äôve been using it everyday for the quizzes, the games, everything and the tests are so accurate!! I love it it keeps me busy and builds my brain. Download it what are you waiting for!üíó"
5,Chemo brain Janet,"After chemotherapy, my thought process was a little slower. I found myself searching for words, memory issues, and some difficulty with math. Other people around me did not recognize it, or think it was a problem. But I knew I was not thinking at the same level I was prior to chemo. This app has been very helpful with my recovery."
5,T-Beta3,"This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve used for brain training ‚Äî and I‚Äôve only used the free version so far. There are a nice amount of different games that challenge your brain but still make it enjoyable. I don‚Äôt mind the ads too much, but if I keep finding value and improvement through use of the app, I will most likely upgrade to a subscription."
4,crayons snd crayons,"I have epilepsy and my symptoms have changed in the past few years. The most frustrating  change is that I tend to become anxious when it comes to making the quick and detailed decisions thatI used to be so good at.I then become depressed and feel somewhat useless. So far I have enjoyed challenges and the sense of accomplishment, however small, that I feel."
5,KellyMaddocm,"I am a teen that is constantly stressed and anxious. Once i heard about this app i thought to myself that it would just be like all the rest. It was not. This app is so great because it doesn‚Äôt make you survey constantly and it‚Äôs just games. As a kid, games really get to me and help me. I love this app and use it daily. Even though they advertise the ‚Äúpremium ‚Äú, it is still awesome with out it!"
5,Billdozer1250,This game will have you coming back for more. It gives you great ways to work out your brain. Impulse makes it fun and challenging. And give you ways to take test that tells you a little  bit about yourself. Not true clinical advice but it‚Äôs a start to better understand the way you are and things you can improve on. All in all Great app!!
5,dakacharlu,"I can feel myself coming back. I played last night for the first time, üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èbtw, and fell asleep after playing and got lots of sleep. Today I accomplished so much and had energy doing it. I haven‚Äôt felt how I felt today in months and the only thing that‚Äôs changed is I played this game for an hour before bed so idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è coincidence? Let‚Äôs see how tomorrow goes! üí§"
3,Dono G.,So my first time using this app the games are fun and interesting but the ads between every game get annoying and their other apps very similar on the market for free where you can do three games free a day without any ads and the game already glitched out I was playing the ancient numbers game and every time you finish it. it doesn‚Äôt actually take you to the home screen or tell you what you scored it just freezes on the zero time left and doesn‚Äôt progress
4,izzasmell,"I love the graphics they r cutely done and it just creates a calming feel, the pacing adds onto that. I def recommend downloading this if you‚Äôd like to get your brain going in an actually fun way :) at the beginning you do have to take a small survey but it‚Äôs nothing serious, just asking what your goals are to grow your brain kinda like duolingo but I can‚Äôt stress that it‚Äôs not serious or nothing at it‚Äôs core it‚Äôs just a fun lil game."
5,Loganberry08,"I‚Äôve ran through a lot of this ‚Äúbrain trainer‚Äù apps. Impulse seems pretty well put together and the price is right. I like the extra features that don‚Äôt come with the other apps, like the personality type quizzes. Keep in mind that these apps are designed to challenge you and are not always the most fun thing to do, but it is great mental exercise!"
1,App.User.222,"So I bought this app based off a TikTok ad stating that it had a certain test that would‚Äôve been of great help to myself and many others- a childhood trauma test. After spending money on it, the test Impulse advertised is nowhere to be found. Not only is Impulse targeting people who are trying to find resources to work through issues but they are literally false advertising which is an actual crime, it is considered a misdemeanor what they are doing and is punishable in a court of law. I don‚Äôt recommend this app as it‚Äôs predatory due to the reasons listed above and I will be escalating this issue."
4,JaywayJams!,Everything but the bugs. Hence 4 stars. The app does not keep accurate record of my progress on Candy Sort. Since making progress is a big part of the draw this is a major flaw but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a simple fix. There has been 2 updates since I noticed this bug and it still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Please fix this bug and I will surely return with a 5 star rating!
5,holallama4456+2,"I think it is a five star because it reminds you of when you should start playing that day so you can keep a streak. I love how it has different games you can play and different tests you can do. There are some challenging ones, some easy ones, and most are very fun! I recommend this app because of how fun and how good it exercises your brain!"
3,"Not so great, little support","Later levels of some games have annoying bugs that require leaving the game . I check for updates a lot but have not seen improvement. Word games contain abbreviated words that make it frustrating at times . Demo instead of demonstration, cam instead of camera, pro instead of professional for example. Repetitive words used as well as conjunctions make it something I will look for other apps to replace this one."
5,Smphotoooo,"I really like brain puzzle games. This app has all the games I have played over the years and more, and I love that instead of just a score against yourself you can also see what parts of your brain you are working with each game type. I wasn‚Äôt going to pay for the subscription but now I think I need to!"
5,Carla Puentes,"At first you might have found impulse because of an ad, like me, but even though it asks you to pay when you first get it know you don‚Äôt have to! Just click the x button and it will let you explore the app! Everything won‚Äôt be unlocked but there is still some fun brain exercises and tests to help improve you and your brain!"
5,Trainer3,"Was hesitant to try this and have been pleasantly surprised. Brain training is imperative for function and this app is challenging, interesting and actually fun. Perhaps it would be helpful as well for those who are getting older to keep the mind sharp, for post concussion athletes to begin the return to learn portion of recovery and those with add/adhd as well.  It is worth your time and energy."
4,Bridgettm011811,"I never write reviews but this is my favorite brain game app that I have found so far, I love the games! The challenge level for me is perfect, not too hard but just challenging enough to keep me focused on solving it. Literally the only negative so far is there‚Äôs like 3 ads of the same thing between each game, a little excessive I think maybe 1 ad max to click out of between each game. Other than that great app!"
5,og bo,"As someone who use to take pride in their mental math ability, I realized that it began to slip due to lack of use. Luckily this app helps me brush up on my skills. This is just one of the many facets of this app. Anyone who is looking for mental test to help with things like memory this is the app for you. On top of all of that, this app can also just be a puzzle app as there is a section fun of fun puzzle games."
4,Lizzie E üíô,"There are a lot of really good brain stretching games in the app but there is a caveat, nearly all of the bonus levels have very shallow and upfront answers that don‚Äôt take into account other aspects of the level. Either get rid of the childish bonus levels or do a major overhaul on what a deeper answer could be.  I do have the payed for version of the game so I can not speak on how intrusive ads are in the app."
1,Maykitty1989,"Never download this app! It doesn‚Äôt have any way to cancel your subscription and keep charging $6,99/week. I am trying to cancel but the app don‚Äôt have anything to cancel, App Store just have upgrade your plan, but no cancel button, no way to get rid off this terrible app, and the training are not even close to explain why cost so much. So that‚Äôs why I stopped play, and thought I had cancel after the free trial, but no, there is no way to cancel this. Sent email to the support. Waiting the answer, also report a refund on Apple Store."
5,LiloP69,"I‚Äôve only just started using this app, but so far, it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs engaging my brain in using info that I don‚Äôt necessarily use on a regular basis, but don‚Äôt want to forget, because it‚Äôs useful. It‚Äôs working on things that I don‚Äôt have time to specifically focus on because I‚Äôm otherwise distracted. So far, it‚Äôs doing exactly what I hoped it would and that‚Äôs a good thing."
5,AZ-Dayday,I love playing the app because it‚Äôs fun and I love the pressure of the time limits while also making my brain more stimulated and healthy. I‚Äôm usually not a person to like these types of games but knowing that this one‚Äôs gonna help me in my day-to-day changes everything and I‚Äôve already noticed a big difference in my brain function.
5,OPG1230,"All the exercises feel like games, it is super fun! All the visual aids are great! simple and updated very useful for games where this help rather than distract from the purpose of the game The instructions are short and very clear The games increase in difficulty as you play which makes it non-predictable which I like a lot Love the whole experience"
5,Chris‚Ç¨¬£¬•,"I rated it a five star so u would see this, all the app will show you is porn ad after porn ad, I accidentally clicked one of threes inappropriate ads and I had to get a whole new I phone due to how many viruses it downloaded after one click, 0/10 this is a scam don‚Äôt download, and developers will not help u or the app whatsoever"
4,Afozter623522,"So many of the games I see advertised in other games are in this one app. I gave it 4/5 because the tests concern me a bit. They may have a tendency to push people toward thinking they have a mental/emotional regulation issue that they do not, especially people who are young, impressionable, and don‚Äôt know themselves well. But with supervision, they could be a helpful talking point between parents and children!"
5,Wend-D,"I was a bit skeptical about this at first, but this is awesome, it feels like I am ‚Äúworking‚Äù out my brain. Focus, awareness and memory should still be worked on as we age. Yes, a lot of us rather watch tv or do something else that is more relaxing but these games are very quick and enjoyable to do. A quick 10 mins it‚Äôs all it takes."
5,Msninja73,"I really like this app because it has a ton of games that are short enough to hold my attention and sharpen my brain and it has no ads!!! (I hate ads ü•¥)  Downloaded from Instagram ad (ironic, I know) but I like it so far.   I find the quizzes a little boring and not sure how reliable they are but the games are good and increase in difficulty."
5,scarlette carrillo,I downloaded this game because I thought it would be fun for long drives or something but no I did this game everyday it helps me with paying attention and testing me on my math in summer which is so helpful so I don‚Äôt forget anyways if your in the edge of getting it get it it has stuff for ages 13 and up it‚Äôs crazy fun and you can choose what type of brain teasers you want
4,3w_z4,"App seems good overall (I am new to it) but it charged me a one time fee to remove ads and did NOT remove any ads after that. I have confirmed it did charge me. The ads are too frequent to really get good use out of this app. They should really only be every 3 min at most but its almost every other game :/ Makes it not worth it in the end, which is unfortunate since this app clearly has potential."
5,mabeycakes1400,"I really enjoy all of the brain games on Impulse. None of them make me feel anxious or over stimulated and I love how it tracks progress and shows how your score compares to your peers! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a game app that isn‚Äôt just full of ads and time killers, and actually wants to keep their brain young and healthy!"
5,Nast9chelios,"GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! From the start I really like this app, but then I did a mistake and took three day free trial, even though I canceled after three days they charged me seven dollars, I didn‚Äôt react to that, I was like OK it happens. BUT THEY KEEP FREAKING CHARGING ME!!!!!! And there‚Äôs no decent support , so I can message them. The website I found can‚Äôt even send a message!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!! GIVE ME MONEY BACK!!!!"
5,idk112233445,"I started playing this game just because I like puzzles and I wanted to learn my IQ, but the game has so much more! The games are really fun and I love how everyday it gives you a couple games curated for you! I think this app is definitely worth getting, and if you do, take the IQ test because the results are quite accurate! Great game and would definitely recommend! üòä"
1,1timothyjames,"If you are willing to pay for results, this is probably a great app. I was attracted by an ad I saw on Instagram and thought I‚Äôd give the personality-related tests a try. It is, unfortunately, just another bait and switch, **they have you take the entire 40-80 question test first, and then to receive the results you have to pay for a monthly/yearly/one time fee**. Note for the developers: It would be more strategic to let the consumer receive one result to get them hooked, rather than paywalling them.   I would have loved to have a fair shot at loving this app."
5,didier.wav,"My brain capabilities are pretty below average, according to a test I got done professionally. My brain coach recommended I take supplements along with doing brain exercises. This app, although I‚Äôve only used it for 2 days so far, has been a great way for me to take actionable steps to improve my executive function and help me think better."
4,Music Consseur,"The amount of ads is astronomical. Every level I play there‚Äôs an ad. It‚Äôs incredibly irritating, especially for those who can‚Äôt spend online money to get rid of them. I understand that the app must put these ads somewhere, but after every level? Ridiculously annoying. Overall, this game is very beneficial for me and helps me focus my mind. Those ads are the only negative thing about the app."
5,Viaverus,Take control of the kind of way you want to be. Feel you have attention issues? Can‚Äôt concentrate? Too many things to do at once? Not sure where to begin? Forgot what you were working on? Moving too slow? All this and more can be ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù that can be worked out with this app.
5,Berk1118,"I don‚Äôt work (disabled) and so I‚Äôm stuck in the house all day. I began noticing that my memory and alertness were slowly slipping away. I‚Äôm only 54, and I really don‚Äôt want to get Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. This app really helps! I really didn‚Äôt realize how ‚Äúout of shape‚Äù my brain was until I started playing this game!! It‚Äôs really making me use my noggin‚Äô!!! Definitely worth every single penny!!!     Sandy"
5,Emily_Jermey,I‚Äôve hade apps in the past to help my anxiety but that were horrible! When I found out about Impulse I downloaded it and I was expecting for me to pay but I didn‚Äôt have to which is great! I tried the first day and it was amazing and if one day isn‚Äôt enough or you want to do more it has other options for to help you! So that‚Äôs why I consider Impulse the best app ever
1,Ynotottag,"Got the TikTok ad for this and looked into it. Pretty much got smacked immediately in the face by subscription fees and managed to X my way around it all. ADHD test was just asking every single thing an ADHD person does in yes or no fashion and is blatantly insulting. Trauma test is the same exact way. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I was able to navigate around the fees being pushed i wouldn't have even done any of them. There is some content, but nevertheless the only reason it gets one star at all is that the art for this is really decent and it‚Äôs a shame it got used in this manner."
5,laxman01736927,I can feel it making my brain function faster. As someone who has smoked copious amounts of weed in the past my brain was truly beginning to feel like pudding. The combination of not smoking and using these games  as a supplement to my brain training has genuinely helped my ability to remember things and do quick mental calculations.
5,SLCJCJS,I just started using this app. So far it is making me think in ways that my everyday life as a retiree doesn‚Äôt. I keep reading about how as we age participating in games and exercises that promote this type of thinking is so important. I‚Äôm going to continue in hopes that it will keep my mind sharp and slow the mental decline that comes as we age.
5,karbear004,"I was hesitant to spend the money, but this app is worth it! The games are bite size and there is lots of variety. The challenges are satisfying and use different skills so if you aren‚Äôt great at one thing, you can excel in others. Graphics are good and game sounds are nice (not annoying and repetitive like some games). I can definitely see improvement the more I play."
5,ickynikki620,"So I've tried other brain training games. This one actually has many options to focus on different areas.  They're also games, so it makes it fun. Not to mention they do notifications to get you to keep coming back to help improve yourself. I love that its free because some other at this level of self help are not free"
5,Zsazsacat,"I really like the variety of games and challenges that provide the opportunity to test my focus, problem solving, memory and math skills.  The developer‚Äôs response to a problem I had with billing was excellent and the issue was quickly resolved.  I just hope that there are new games on the horizon so the app doesn‚Äôt get stale."
5,Ha benched akkaj,I am on the 3rd day of the free trial and I‚Äôve already seen improvements in all areas trained. The best part is it‚Äôs also instantly showing correlation in my life. I‚Äôm sharper in everything I do. I wish I could afford to buy the full version myself but I‚Äôm in a unique situation. Very reasonably priced espiecially if you take them up on the lifelong promo. The proof is in the pudding on this one.
5,Kodirene,I have used Impulse for 87 days. I enjoy the daily games and the tests. I find myself mentally prepared for the early mornings before heading into work when I do my daily workout. I have learned something‚Äôs about myself and surprised how accurate by some of the test results that I have done. The games are great for short spurts of mental breaks during the day.
4,ofcomeon,I really enjoy the many options for keeping my mind sharp as I age. One big drawback for me being partially color blind with this app is the word guess game. This could be a favorite if there was more contrast between the yellow and light green used currently.  I see nearly the same color and it makes it frustrating since I can‚Äôt determine if a letter is in the correct position!
3,totumos,"I love the challenge, I got it because of the ratings and because of the public support. BUT, how can it be possible that after all this glory there is no one to answer or to fix a glitch in a game?  I‚Äôve sent 3 emails to ‚Äòleave feedback‚Äô because there is no ‚Äòreport a problem‚Äô email. No one has answered, no one has fixed the problem to the game ‚ÄúCandy sort‚Äù, frustrating!  Thank you if you respond."
5,billyrussell,"I enjoy the daily reminders for a quick test of fun. Each game is different and not so mind boggling. Although you are sent sale prices for weekly memberships, the cost of living right now is so high, I have to choose. Unfortunately paying rent, and food for the family comes first. I will revisit the thought when the economy is better."
3,Dmcamacho13,"The tests are ok. The games are ok. The definitions they use in Word Ninja are absolutely abominable. It‚Äôs more of a word scramble than anything else as the definitions almost never make any actual sense with the given word. The Words search runs out of levels too early. And the Words crossword is quite possibly one of the most frustrating games I‚Äôve ever played (and I don‚Äôt mean that as a compliment). Honestly take it or leave it. It‚Äôs not terrible, not awful, but not wonderful either."
1,Momiji523,"Subscribed to this app before doing my due diligence. There is no scientific evidence that brain training apps do anything to improve brain function or delay cognitive decline. They will improve your performance with these particular games, but that‚Äôs it. And there is no refund if you change your mind. I purchased a 1-year subscription, so now I have paid for an app that I won‚Äôt use again. Of course, I can continue to use it until December of next year but that‚Äôs kind of beside the point. There‚Äôs little chance of me using it anymore and the money is gone."
5,MJ Tals n Nate,"I hate pointless games, you know the ones to play monopoly or crush candy! Impulse is different, it has useful games that have a point. Brain power is so important to everyday life and keeping it sharp is very important to me. I highly recommend this app, if you want something more then just playing pointless games!"
5,Tradrchik,"I love games, I especially love the stats that this app gives me.  Tells me what part of my brain is being worked when doing a specific game!  I‚Äôm starting young so I can keep doing this before I have any decline and this will help develop strong skills in many different areas.  I highly recommend it!"
5,Mattie Marin,It‚Äôs a really good game because it helps with my memory and it helps my brain focus and I can learn on how to become more focused and learn new things and build my knowledge. I can also really tell that the game developer was really open minded and thought he could help open our minds to and I really appreciate that so much so props to the developer. Thank you. ü§ó
5,KayleeP2002,"I have noticed improvement in my mental focus, memory and math skills. Not only do they do that, but in a fun way that makes me want to make a habit out of it. I also enjoy the mini games and puzzles, it‚Äôs just like other games but with no ads. I highly recommend this app, I have tried other brain game apps and this has been my favorite by far!"
5,ReyNegrita,"I paid for the year and I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs only been a few days and I honestly do see some improvement with my memory already. I really appreciate the games too, because they give me something fun AND productive to do when I have downtime at work.  I like that I‚Äôm learning, improving my mind and having a good time all at once."
5,_Hollybranch22_,"Not to overbearing with what you can and can‚Äôt buy right now I wish I could have 5 training games a day free but in the future when I‚Äôm just trying to complete my streak and not anything else the three games is very manageable also like how the achievements only correlate to what activities I can play for free, I love how I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out"
5,Supernatural fangirl one,"I love it, it doesn‚Äôt take too much time to do a daily practice and I feel like it helps me. The app is well organized and if I don‚Äôt understand an exercise, the rules are explained in detail and an example given so I can immediately get the idea. Well worth the money because it‚Äôs a great value! I have an annual subscription now and plan on using it daily!"
5,My5wagga,"Let‚Äôs just say my brain hurts ( in a good way). Sometimes it‚Äôs a good idea to revert back to basics in order to hone your skills. And I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve forgotten how to do a few of the basics offered in Impulse such as idioms, puzzle and memory games to say a few. I am feeling a lot of enjoyment while playing this game and I am glad I signed up for the annual sub ."
5,Luckit17,"Free is convenient, you have a few games to play on a daily basis to train with and I like the evaluation since it doesn‚Äôt put you down at any direction. The games make me feel encouraged to keep coming back for more so I can extend my mental ability & they all feel catered to my own personal needs all while being both fun and simple."
5,Nausetry2,"I enjoy the tests a lot.  While I‚Äôm not sure exactly what to do with the results, it is interesting for sure.   Just started the brain quizzes and other items.  Got the lifetime deal on sale so happy about that, though missed the super sale!   Oh well.   Fun app overall and if it helps even a little then I‚Äôm happy."
4,ClaybourneAlley,"Great brain game trainer. It‚Äôs nice feeling like the app is genuinely targeting your areas that need improving, plus the personality tests are interesting and fulfilling; I guess it satisfy a that desire in all of us to have specific attention to us, you can target exact areas and know more about yourselves,, 4.6, some of the features and design need to be more seamless and unified but the app content itself is top notch."
5,The indelible hulk,"This has been a great app for housing all of the little brain exercise games I enjoy doing. Also having a toddler, I know he‚Äôs going to be playing a lot of these development games in school, so I need to brush up on them myself. I wish there were a few more long form games like logic puzzles, crosswords or sudoku."
5,Atak_Oteng,"This is a very solid app. I like that there‚Äôs different games. I‚Äôm curious to see if there will be any new games developed. Overall satisfied with the app and UI is very user friendly.   The word search is very easy regardless of the level, I wish the developers made it more difficult. It would be nice if app had some kind of brain game with classic playing cards."
3,Beomsbbg,I‚Äôve been using this app for a while and i used to spend long amounts of time on it and have a few ads here and there now I have so many ads that I can‚Äôt play a game or finish my daily brain workouts it‚Äôs came to a point where I can‚Äôt do anything without it glitching from so many ads and after I watch an ad to get to an game and I finish a level (even quickly) I have to watch another ad and it glitches
5,StrongIntelligentWoman,"Best brain training ever!  If you ever play any games you will want to play these!  For me - I‚Äôve never really been one to be able to do math in my head beyond simple numbers and actions, though now I am able to do slightly more complex math!  It‚Äôs the small wins!  Plus these are just simply the funnest games!  I feel like I accomplish something when I play them!"
5,Ashj25,"This app is full of interesting, challenging, engaging games that you can do in less than 5 minutes. I‚Äôm very competitive and love to se how I did at the end of each challenge. This challenge makes me want to go back each morning to try to see how much have I accomplished. Love doing this in the morning with my coffee before starting my day."
5,koolaid girl333,"Impulse is the beast training brain game ever! It is educational, but also very fun! I love this game it is so good, it is also very attractive I love playing this game it is very good for the brain and very fun! Everybody in my family plays this game and finds it very fun. I just got to say 5 star! I can‚Äôt believe it is fun and educational at the same time, and it also has no bugs can‚Äôt believe it! I love this game."
5,B06/11momma,"Instead of focusing on negatives in life, that you can‚Äôt control, work on you and your brain! It‚Äôs a positive you can control in your life. Your brain, your life! Our brains are muscles too. We work out to keep our muscles toned, so why not work out our brains?! Memory loss happens as we age. How do we keep it sharp? Play brain games. Better your brain!"
5,Edithfl,I‚Äôve had two concussions and this has affected my brian in so many ways. I been looking for the right app to help challenge the areas I need to stay sharp. This app is helping me so much. My brian is able to problem solve and also allows to see areas I need to work on. It also has helped my brain relax after a difficult day.
1,chi vfh,A twisted ad for a pornographic game depicting a sexual assault just came up while I was playing this game!  The game is rated for 4+ years!  Do NOT let your kids play this game!!  I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other game and am shocked that the developers of these games are allowed to violate a poor unsuspecting child or victim of sexual assault with stuff like this in their ads when they‚Äôre expecting to play a fun and innocent game. This app needs to be taken down until the developer fixes the problem - other reviews have noted the same issue.  I‚Äôve sent a report to Apple.
5,a719va,"I‚Äôm 37 years old and I feel old so I just want to make sure What I feel is not actually. But yet it‚Äôs just me needing something to keep me sharp. This helps, again so far so good. Competition is always good knowing your doing better than most at your age, then again it‚Äôs all in your head. Keep sharp, don‚Äôt let your brain fall short"
1,Beaster23,"This app is unbelievable. Make no mistake, this app doesn‚Äôt improve your memory or anything else it claims to do.   The games are all unbelievably simple, and serve only as a nice little dopamine hit, a little pat on the head for completing petty little tasks. In exchange for giving you your little reward, all they ask is little monthly subscription fee.  This isn‚Äôt a brain trainer. It‚Äôs more akin to a slot machine, where you pay to receive a ‚ÄúGood Job!‚Äù rather than a chance at winning money. It saddens me that they can sell you such a thinly veiled farce, and saddens me more that so many people buy it."
5,blue skyys,I love this game if u are in school and u have a upcoming test this game helps u remember where things are and trains ur brain to remember what u learned in class this game is fun and whatever u wanna work click on it in the game and it will be the games number one priority on making sure u know it I most definitely recommend this game for anyone and any ages
2,kell7371,"Just another ‚Äúfree‚Äù app where you get into it and start trying things out then you get hit with a payment wall. You waste your time taking their quizzes just to get to the end and find out you have to pay MONTHLY to see your results. Who wants to pay for a subscription on an app? Just charge for the app itself and your numbers just might go up. With all the streaming services milking us for our money, most can‚Äôt afford to hand another app more money every month."

3,IdnKoGs766,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, all of the games on this app are amazing and work perfectly. For someone who doesn‚Äôt want to subscribe.. how could I relax and feel less anxious when there are so many ads popping up. I‚Äôm not talking rarely, this is constantly. After moving on to the next stage ads come up and to get rid of this I need to pay? ridiculous. You already have so many people playing the game, why add advertisement? it just doesn‚Äôt make sense."
5,Randi Marieü¶ã,"Never would I have thought that a game would challenge and stretch my brain so much. This game is beneficial to my everyday life, by exercising my concentration and decision making skills. It‚Äôs even fun to see how much I thought I had life figured out until this game shows me that I need more work lol! Definitely download this game if you‚Äôre looking to maximize your brain power!!"
4,plsfromsarah,"I'm sorry, but can a dev direct me to a how-to video or something on how to defeat level 50 of Candy Sort, because I am genuinely convinced that it's impossible to solve. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars (sorry!). Otherwise, the app is nice! I'm sticking to the free side of it, and the ads aren't terribly intrusive, so that's neat.  Level 50 of Candy Sort, however, is not neat. It's driving me insane. Help."
5,mr steal ur bones,"y'all i'm completely hooked to this game specifically, it helps me destress and I can't even remember how many times I've gone over all the levels. pretty please can we get some new ones? I know we just had an update a little while ago with more levels but I just really like this game and they get harder the more you play"
5,KitBoBit!üëÅ,"Impulse has been adaptive and fast paced fun. As someone who plays console games like Xbox and PlayStation titles, this is actually entertaining as an education tool. It contains something I think most phone games are missing in pizzaz The ads are tolerable if you‚Äôre willing to use just for training, and not to pay for the ‚Äúfull features‚Äù section/membership."
5,IeshaDivine369,"Impulse really improves my focus and memory. I know how after I play Impulse the night before work it‚Äôs easier for me to remember 2/3 orders that I have in 2 minutes. Usually I‚Äôll have to read the board to go over the order twice ( sometimes three times lol ) if I see progress anyone can/will. Just give impulse a try, I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.  Darian J       - from Pendleton SC"
5,Aquena71,"This is a quality app.  I have had neuropsychological testing done and this app has skills to practice that help me maintain my processing speed, memory and math skills.  I just started this app a few days ago.  It never gets boring.  Great for ages 10 (basic math and reading) to any age adult.  I had a stroke and have some cognitive issues plus ADHD and this is a fun way to keep sharp."
5,CALEB THE SECOND,"It‚Äôs a great app especially for someone like myself who has trouble remembering and paying attention to things. This app has really helped me think and remember things much faster, I would definitely encourage anybody to at least try the app it‚Äôs fun and beneficial what else could you ask for.  :)"
5,PeachySS16,It‚Äôs honestly great. I love that I have a few quick games designed for me and what I want to improve on. I love that there are other games you choose from that help with memory and quick thinking. I also love the quizzes that help me better understand how I function and who I am as a person.
5,sjksksw,"i been using this app and I like it so far. however, i notice out of 9/10 games i play i always get ‚Äúyou scored higher than 90 percentile in your group‚Äù. sometimes I get 99 and I‚Äôm confused since my memory and brain power is very much lacking. I wondering if the stats are really true. besides that, its fun and easy to use."
5,Maya Dousharm,"Impulse is a great app, with fun unique games that can test your brain in all different ways. Either you have some free time to spend, or you just wish to play for your daily training. While also having a remind system that ables me to remember to practice, and the daily training system has helped my brain grow tremendously. üëçüëç"
5,Shobrina Johnson,"There is a large variety of games to play. I don‚Äôt like buying subscriptions for games, however this one wasn‚Äôt too bad. Paid about $30 for a year subscription. Again, I‚Äôd prefer it be free, but not a horrible price. Definitely uses your brain for most of the games. Very fun and makes me feel like my brain in being exercised."
5,Banks1459,I never play games in my phone.  I stumbled across this little gem and my brain is successfully recovering from the brain cells I‚Äôve killed from beer drinking.  Just when I thought I needed to slow down on the beer consumption this brain training exercise came along to allow me to continue to crush the cervezas-thank you developers!!!
5,Sweeth0neyz,The games are unique and attractive. I would say that they should always make new puzzles instead of doing the same concept but different puzzles to keep you interested. And there should be some rules about gaining hearts. I don‚Äôt understand why I stopped earning hearts even when I did solve puzzles correctly on the first try.
4,avame gril,So the title there‚Äôs so many options with premium too many. If I don‚Äôt wanna pay then I waste and hour of my day to see my iq score just have to pay but I don‚Äôt want to if you could see the scores for free the it would a 5 starts but until then if 4 because I‚Äôm NOT paying to see it and i don‚Äôt care if theirs a 5.00 option I could use 5 dollars for something else
5,Lenninhymer,I‚Äôm so happy for it‚Äôs scoring so much I just can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs happening! My birthday is December 10th 1984 and my first name starts with the 12th letter in the alphabet and my second name starts with the tenth! As for 1984‚Ä¶ 1+9=10 & 8+4=12‚Ä¶. And then they have the same number as my very first score which was the first perfect score of the first game and I swear to you that my score was 1210
4,Emilya08,It‚Äôs honestly pretty fun and is a quick and easy thing to do daily to sharpen your brain which is surprising to me because I‚Äôm not good with doing anything that I find slightly boring daily‚Ä¶. I also never rate apps cause I think it‚Äôs a waste of time but this app is definitely worth it!!! Also can you guys lighten up on the ads there not to bad just less would make it a whole lot better.
5,Hip Hop Curator 1,"The app is amazing. Better than all other brain training apps I‚Äôve used thus far. I was in a car accident in 2009, since which I‚Äôve felt like my mind has slipped every year. This app has sparked some change in how my injury is healing. Before I started using this I felt like I would fade into nothing. Now I feel like there‚Äôs hope."
5,antoniofarias,"This app is not just games and lost time, it is also a great way to be keep our brain from withering away so easy, the games are simple yet fun and not so easy as one would think and a sort of schedule design to maintain a program of exercise to be well round , all in all a very recomendable app to kill time and maintain a well functioning brain"
5,Teresa m Nies,I have had several brain training apps. This by far has been the most entertaining. After a while I loose interest but this app offers different game challenges daily. I also enjoy the option to play without purchase. I have not made that leap yet but every day I play I‚Äôm closer to making that purchase.
4,AZ|PRO,"This is a great game and all, there are multiple things you can do, to improve your brain skills, and getting premium makes it much better. However I took away one star because of the drawing level. It‚Äôs impossible to get five stars on the rank Artist, since there is only 235 levels I remember there used to be 300. Developers, if you are reading please do something. Thanks!"
5,Pershia Baravi,"So, hi :) I‚Äôve been someone who has been stuck doing work and video games almost everyday, never with the motivation to improve myself and I felt my brain was loosing the capability to process things with good functionality as it used to when I would go to school. So having this app is making me feel like I am slowly bringing that back :)"
5,Birdyghostly,"It‚Äôs annoying that you only get 1% of the results for the tests with the free edition, but it‚Äôs fine I guess. The games are very engaging and refreshing for my brain though! I would recommend this app for someone that struggles with focus or wants to sharpen their brain. I have ADHD and this helps when I use the app before homework."
5,kite1234,I like the challenge and that it is quick but accurate. Only issue is that the games/challenges sometimes don‚Äôt tell you anymore what you are supposed to do but figuring it out is a challenge alone I appreciate but I do sometimes have to start over due to the lack of information.
5,Jilley484,So I‚Äôve only had the app 2 days but so far I really enjoy it! The games are fun and I LOVE taking quizzes that are not advertisements. The quizzes give me actual insight about myself and I find that fascinating. I find myself getting sucked in to the information and honestly I could spend my time doing worse less productive things.
1,CaliforniaKayla,"The three day trial access is a ploy for signups: Users do not have full access to the application and tests results, e.g. the Archetype test. During the trial, I took the test, and the a pop up for an in-app purchase appeared for $6.99 in order to view the results during the trial period‚Ä¶ I declined, but was still accessed $6.99. The punchline? Even with the charge, I have no access to view the results or engage with the application at the premium level. Unsubscribed and deleted the application on the same day‚Äîthere are better options out there."
1,Nikinikiniki467443,"If you‚Äôre just going to have content blocked off, only available if you pay‚Ä¶  The cost of app seems like a decent deal, content is interest to me‚Ä¶ but I want to see what I am paying for! I used less than 5 minutes and now I will delete it.  It‚Äôs not like you have a free version of the app available, it‚Äôs a very small 3 day trial, why not make all your content available so people can make a decision.  There‚Äôs way too many crappy apps out there, I‚Äôm not going to take a gamble and hope what you offer is worth paying for."
5,_mkjr,I‚Äôm really enjoying the different challenges that come up daily. I am hoping to notice a difference in my everyday life because of the games. The games peak my interest and keep me intrigued. The free version has good options so I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending to get the full package because from what I see so far it‚Äôll be worth it.
5,david dobrik fanboi,"I used to be skeptical of apps like this that you have to pay for the subscription but it is entertaining for when you don‚Äôt want to scroll on social media, and after a few hours of getting lost in the games my brain actually felt very good"
2,Ledogboy,"Eh, I was interested and gave it a whirl. Even at the start of a free three day trial you get pressured at every turn to subscribe for a year. Then you ‚Äúwin‚Äù a gift for completing a game- guess what? It‚Äôs a discount for a subscription! Leave that screen and try one of the tests. Finish the test and the results are blocked unless you pay for a year. Yeah decline, but wait- now it offers to sell you the results for the low, low price of $4 (or whatever it was). Basically, the thing feels like a scam, and it‚Äôs getting deleted stat."
3,NillaSista,I have been enjoying this app for the past few days BUT my touch is not being registered on several words (in different areas of the screen). I will highlight a word & it does not work. Then I try touching each letter & retry. Sometimes that works & sometimes the word works if highlighting the word backwards. Other times I just gave up & went to the next game. It was so bad time after time that I just quit. VERY frustrating!
5,MarvelMari24,"This game is so fun, it makes me feel organized and the games are fun to!  I love the rush of adrenaline when a timer starts it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a situation and I save the day! Basically like a hero, also this game lets you skip ads in only 5-10 seconds it gives me a warm cozy feeling as well there are literally no downsides I love it 5 stars!"
5,Mkatz4,"I actually put off playing it after I downloaded it (randomly) but while waiting One day I gave it a try‚Ä¶‚Ä¶And I was surprised , pleasantly I may add. I enjoyed the short games and they made me feel like I was taking a deep cleansing breath but in my brain (make sense?) Alsomsee how I outperformed 99% of others in my age group or 89% was super awesome!"
5,Poot Moodigan,"Working your brain this way is the same way my grandfather staved off dementia by doing puzzles a few minutes everyday. Whether it was crosswords, word searches or mazes, my grandfather never lost a beat mentally well into his eighties. This app makes you feel like you‚Äôre working out your brain a little bit each day. It‚Äôs wonderful."
5,cuurly kales,"It is an app that I am extremely proud of my own mind within, that‚Äôs absolutely remarkable to someone recovering from such a horrid time in her own mind with no support around to help see the hidden gems of the mind. 10% working it‚Äôs ways beyond, this app allows for me to notice the extension in the brain cells with emotions. Thank you. - üï≥üíì"
4,superpup1019,"i never thought i would say this but wow i‚Äôm amazed by this app!! i‚Äôm 14 and my mom wanted me to start working on brain games and I came across this one, I love this app it definitely does help challenge my brain I absolutely love love LOVE the games they have on here but it does have a downfall, after each round you get an ad which is a bummer because most of the time it‚Äôs the same ads over and over and over."
5,deadpool_88,"You know you have those days when you are bored and you just don‚Äôt want to do the same boring stuff all over again, well this app makes your time fun you feel active. It will also improve your mind it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs easy level you brain is making function."
5,EmersynJ,"Impulse is the best brain training game of all time! It really makes you think, and always gives you honest results! There are tons of games and quizzes to take, and Impulse always has special games just for you! So don‚Äôt believe this nonsense about how bad it it, download it now, and see for yourself! That Impulse is definitely worth it."
1,Morse Code of Doom,"There's an obnoxious ad after every single level of every single game. These are timed ads so you are stuck watching them for 30 seconds before you can cancel them. After that, you have to wait on a different timed screen before you can FINALLY close the ad, and you'll then be redirected to the app store. To make matters worse, adds are for the same equally obnoxious garbage games like solitaire and homescapes. Get this app if you want an endless loop of pointless advertisements. Get literally ANYTHING else if you want to actually do something other than generating ad revenue for this developer."
4,12b1inamillion,"Impulse is one of the best brain training apps I‚Äôve ever used. It have great mind games and even tests; IQ tests, ADHD tests, etc. The only downside about this game is that it costs money, and many people would just like to have a brain training app for free but other than that, this app is amazing. There are no ads and you can see what your score is compared to others. Overall I‚Äôd rate this app 4.5 stars, it truly is great."
5,postalxbreakdown,Premium version of this app rules.  The mini games and challenges are near unlimited which is also rules if you have a short attention span. I find myself burning away time where I would have been doom scrolling locked into this app which overall is a huge plus in my books.
5,Yessssssssss&@(),"I love this app so much! It‚Äôs 100% free, unless you want to unlock extra fun games! You can take tests bout yourself. You can find a brief answer to the test but if you want to find out more about yourself you have to pay. Overall this is a great app. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone who wants to train there brain!"
5,HARR411,This app has kept me motivated to do these activities! the activities are easy short and fun in my opinion! The best part is it helps me with everyday life! It‚Äôs just 3 easy activities each day! You can choose what you want to work on and what you don‚Äôt! And set a goal for yourself! This app is free in the Apple App Store but with adds.
5,Jock Cranley,"This is simply the best Am getting better already I can‚Äôt say much but it‚Äôs as simple as it can be This is great man I‚Äôm loving it already. And the fact that they tell u the percentage at which u passed ur peers,‚Ä¶bruh for me that says ‚Äúchallenge urself to be better‚Äù man, I don‚Äôt know about the rest of y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs really good, try it out!"
5,Liliana love,"This game is actually like a five star. Why because it actually like teaches you how to like move your brain around and like did you like lots of fun stuff and that‚Äôs what I read it a five star please. I need you to try this, so thank you I hope this is sponsored by the person that that made the swing, so yeah I hope you have an amazing day"
4,Zaharalynn,"Great source of information about how we rate intellectually speaking in this world. Although not exact science, it gives a good sense of where we stand in regards to others. The games and quizzes are not too heavy or personally invasive, yet the outcome is quite precise. I have enjoyed every minute of finding out more about myself and feeling confident that I am intelligent."
1,shelbym21,"I got the free trial to start out and it states ‚Äúwill not charge until the end of the trial period‚Äù but I went to pay my credit card today and sure enough, they charged me before my trial period even ended. Not impressed with companies that say one thing and do another  The app was similar to other brain game type apps and I‚Äôm not seeing anything that warrants the subscription cost. Also, the purchase didn‚Äôt even show up in my subscriptions either so I had to go out of my way to try to work with Apple to cancel this."
4,Braydenbleak,"This game is fantastic its multiple games in one and with the quizzes section that makes it multi platform esq. I would buy the premium but the $29 a year is a little much. The developers did great on this game, people would be more inclined to pay on a one time charge of $10-$20. If you go in over-asking you‚Äôll most likely get less than you first bargained for."
5,TheCharlieVerse,I think that impulse is a great app to sharpen your mind. It even tells you when you outperform others. This app is great for remembering simple math problem and getting your memory to be photographic. Also the focus aspect of this game is just brilliant. The one with the arrows and the one with the sort the trash really makes you focus hard and what to do.
4,Swaggertyman,I was looking for an app to help with basic short term memory and after using Impulse for a week I have seen some gain in focus and remembering numbers even basic math skills has improved. The one thing I dislike is that I can‚Äôt seem to sync progress between my iPad and iPhone. I paid for the lifetime subscription and was hoping there was a way to sync them.
1,DT1256,"5 minutes into using the app and I get prompted with a prompt to review it, unskippable advertisements, and ‚Äúamazing‚Äù discounts for a paid subscription. All before I can really figure out what the app is about.   I‚Äôm deleting the app after being spammed once every hour with push notifications to use the app, that if clicked on only open more advertisements. The ‚Äúexercises‚Äù are just simple flash games, not even sure if I could cal them puzzles or anything that insinuates productivity. Why is this a highly recommended app on the App Store?"
5,N'Awlins in SFLA,"This is only my second day. However, I can see how much I need it, because it is quite challenging. The bursts are short enough for me to not want to give up. I started with the minimum possible to not get discouraged. So far so good. Would like to comment again in another month. I almost can feel my synapses growing."
5,Andrea ‚òª,"At first I didn‚Äôt believe in the app, but as soon as I opened it and did my first activity, I was in shock. I play this whenever I‚Äôm stressed and it works like a charm when it comes to calming one. Overall this might seem bland, but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not even describable with words! I really recommend trying it!"
5,F Manzini,It‚Äôs really easy to stick with this app so far. It helps especially when I am feeling anxious and need to focus prior to a meeting or presentation. I personally struggle with letting my nervous derail my productivity in both scenarios.  I prepare diligently and just have things apart when I‚Äôm on stage or just meeting with colleagues. It seems silly but these games really help.
5,MikeyUnknown,"As the title says , it‚Äôs a great game . The different mini games within keeps me engaged , whether it‚Äôs matching items , basic math , or following an image with a single line . there‚Äôs many ways this game improves your brain . 10/10 would recommend . kind of a steep price for a the full version ( i say as a college student ) but the daily tasks are enough !!"
5,......‚òÅ,I decided to give this a try because I have been looking for ways to help my Momz concentration & memory.  She has been suffering from memory loss for a few years now.  Now that I‚Äôve gone thru several rounds I plan on adding it to her phone & tablet.    I will post an update on how it is going with her after awhile.  *fingers crossed*.
5,addison{(!!!!!)}#$,It is a great game to practice memory and other skills you might not be born with. It keeps track of how many days you have been on it. It also has tests you can take to make to levels harder to do or easier. That is all I have about Impulse. Also it is a great game to play in the car or even when you are just bored.
5,Vicki . V,I loved this game it really tests your skills. This is such a fun game and you should try it I have had the best experience with this game and I‚Äôm 10 impulse wanted me to help so this is the review just download the game. There‚Äôs not a lot of ads to skip to 15 seconds and you can take test to see if you have ADHD or anxiety or stuff like that so download it.
1,shanbo2,"I downloaded it because I got a ad on another app and started doing some of the ‚Äúbrain teasers‚Äù. None of them were like what I seen in the ad, I bought the premium to see if it was in there and it wasn‚Äôt. So, when I deleted it, it was still charging me. I‚Äôve read other reviews about this and y‚Äôall say the same thing to all other customers. Honestly, don‚Äôt install this garbage app, it scams you and takes money for no reason, what‚Äôs the point of making brain teasers and making people pay just to make themselves smarter. Such terrible people work at this company."
5,123546217,"I like the games but I can‚Äôt choose them, I have not seen the ones to draw which I think would be more of a challenge for me. Thank you for your response. Looks like I found the game after all, it does not show but you can choose it if you browse."
5,MEGHANWHOOP,I find myself scrolling on social ruining my serotonin levels & creating false reality in my head lol along with the occasional self comparison lol  This is a super fun alternative & keeps the brain working in some way we might not use too much - idk would rather play a brain game than lose cells from social medias in my all free time
5,GoodGroup,"I really felt engaged in these minigames and it didn‚Äôt feel gimmicky or forced. No ads, an all around decent experience. I like that it tells you how you stack up against other users and keeps you engaged with goals as well. Wish I could facilitate buying the full version! But I can‚Äôt at the moment üò∞"
5,Pen gwynn,This is a great app that gives you the opportunity to challenge yourself and to see how well you rate with others. It also gives you the opportunity to see how well and how much you can advance in a short period of time. It‚Äôs challenging. It‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs rewarding. It‚Äôs enjoyable and just an all around good time.
5,ang65,"Variety of brain exercises that keep you interested, and are quick to do. I have been starting my day with short exercises to get my mind ready for the day. Plus there are extra ‚Äúgames‚Äù to keep your mind sharp.  I also like the tests that you first do to establish your baseline, as well as your strengths and weaknesses."
5,kiwi.chimX2,The game is easy to work with. It knows it has ads and advises you how to deal with them. The games are a very fun challenge and I hope to be able to keep on playing for long enough without having to pay. Or if I find it good enough to keep going I‚Äôll actually start paying for it.
5,Buck Up Louise,"Strike that, I do love my brain‚Ä¶ this game is just here to make me awesomely aware of areas of improvement, areas that have been neglected, and most certainly avoided. As my wise, energetic age 83 grandmother says: the more you do, the more you can do. If the brain is a muscle, as they say‚Ä¶ then Impulse is a mental gym membership offering guaranteed results. Here‚Äôs to still growing."
1,barefootbori,"Even if you get a subscription, say the base level, if you don‚Äôt buy up to the yearly you cannot access everything - but it acts like you can when you are choosing a subscription. Bait & switch vibes. Also, apps like these are not scientifically backed #1 and #2 the science actually demonstrates that these do not improve IQ, brain function, or anything else. They‚Äôre all baseless claims. Fun for gaming if that‚Äôs your thing though.  1-star due to the inability to access everything even when you are paying a subscription."
4,TheBestiesChannel,"I don‚Äôt have memory loss or anything but doing this everyday is so fun and easy! I really fell like im improving but it‚Äôs like everything you have to pay for. I‚Äôll finish a quiz or a game and I have to pay to see the results. I never liked reading and now I have to PAY to read? No, no, NOOO. It‚Äôs good and I recommend but if they really make us pay 2.00 for the app In the first place and then LET ME SEE WHAT PERSONALITY I HAVE!!!"
5,adfallin,"I have gone to many doctors, and have had this type of training from Professionals for thousands of thousands of dollars. For the first time in my life, I can finally take control of how I am learning without the overly inflated price tag of doctors. I absolutely love this app."
3,Zenutopia,"I have been enjoying playing the brain games, and I feel really accomplished when I get 100%. I recently updated the app this week, and then I noticed the game ‚Äúcandy sort‚Äù is buggy. It works for the first few moves, and then I‚Äôm not able to move the candy into a new flask. The candy just pops straight up and down. It doesn‚Äôt move into a new container. Developers, can you please fix this???"
3,"Jarhkfg!gfligwru,fg""rbf,","I love this app, it has great mind training games and it keeps me off of social media. It‚Äôs the best mind training app I've seen so far, but why do have to pay to get test results. Seriously? I took 16 minutes out of my day (which doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but I could‚Äôve been doing something else) to take and IQ test that didn‚Äôt even give me the results. Very annoying, can you at least give part of the result, like just your IQ?"
5,pup fluffer,"I love this app so much because it helps me with my memory and helps make my brain so much stronger. Since I am in school, it helps me with my smartness for school. In the beginning, it asks you to select your age, which is very helpful because it knows what you need help with from there. I love this app because it is and can be very helpful for all."
5,Psychic9548602205,I‚Äôve played many brain training games in the past and this app is different from all the others every day it gives you different games to play that‚Äôs enjoyable and each different game improves something different for your brain.  Give it a try! You get a one week free trail than it‚Äôs a membership
5,solodai76,"My memory has improved since doing daily exercises and my computations are no longer delayed !  I‚Äôve always loved challenging brain teasers but this one in particular has help me become more balanced hemisphere wise. So it‚Äôs worth the fee that you pay to play fun games. And improve concentration, memory and comprehension skills."
5,ashton3310,"Most people after work or during down time watch movies/shows. I personally do it as well but have recently started to play these games. I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference I‚Äôm my short term/long term memory, focus, and ability to problem solve. This app is truly a gem!"
5,T√≠shaüòá,"This is the illy game that will stay on my phone and the next and the next. When I‚Äôm in the middle of a crowd I can pull out my phone and play a game. Not only does it calms my anxiety, but it strengthen me mentally. It‚Äôs a good way to challenge your skills. And most of all, it‚Äôs fun. All the things I like to do and play all in one app. I highly recommend. This game is my electronic therapy,"
5,Muffintop Mike,I am a firm supporter of an application that wants to enhance the brain . Impulse is an app that triggers our impulses and how to make better judgmental decisions through various memory game and observing patterns . I enjoy apps like Lumosity and elevate but Impulse has it beat with affordable pricing and lifetime membership opportunity. A game like this will be good for your relatives whether they are nieces or nephews or even older siblings .
5,bernicenata,"I personally don't like playing games. I'd get bored after I play twice, but people say I need to play to train my brain in order to minimize the risk of dementia (I'm still 22) but this game is really a game changer! Definitely increased my alertness, and gosh my brain do feel like it was having a workout sesh!"
5,jamie rush,"I‚Äôm 45 and I felt like my brain was going away and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was scared that I was aging and my brain was not aging well. I started using this app and so far it‚Äôs helping me tremendously. I‚Äôm still new with it, so we‚Äôll see where we are in a few months from now, but I am hopeful and optimistic that it will help my brain tremendously."
4,oregonwolf,"I feel like they need to add more games. And have better tracking of your scores. Also on the word guess game, give us some other options besides 5 letter words. Also, I can‚Äôt follow directions because it said to leave a 5 star review with a detailed comment to see what they could fix but if I leave a 5 star review, where‚Äôs the room for improvement?"
5,SallyG97,"I play every day and I love it. It keeps me thinking and has greatly improved my abilities. I especially love the puzzles, candy sort, language games. I am working on improving my math skills. It‚Äôs worth it and I wouldn‚Äôt say that if I really didn‚Äôt feel it. The robotic flows calm me down at night. I just can‚Äôt say enough good about this app."
5,nanie007,The main reason why I like impulse is I get a mental break. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom of 3 which means my brain is always looking out for danger. I never have a break and although this has my attention it‚Äôs quite different. For a few minutes a day I get to just enjoy impulse. I‚Äôm testing my brain & I have fun while doing it.
5,Gr8Ape1974,"I‚Äôm on my 2nd day and really like the variety of activities, so far. Keeps my scatterbrain entertained while also challenging it. I also like how the activities start out easy and then progressively get more difficult. At least I can feel somewhat accomplished even if it is challenging at times."
5,Limanball,"And this app will help you do that. 10-20 or even 30 minutes a day will be great to get your brain in the right mode. And most of the people are spending hours on their phones daily, so why not do something useful for yourself. Instead of scrolling down the TikTok, Instagram or any other feed."
5,#gamer.com,It‚Äôs so fun and it honesty makes me feel smarter. i love how it gives me feedback after every game on how i did and personalizes that game for me so i can improve! i don‚Äôt pay for the subscription and honestly you don‚Äôt need to it‚Äôs an amazing game as it is and there are barely any ads(please don‚Äôt change that). highly recommend!
5,FlailingMo,This app really does give your brain a workout and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. I also like the different test that you can take that analyze how your mind works. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you only want to kill some time or really get into doing some serious mental training it‚Äôs worth checking this app out. It‚Äôs worth it.
1,Cdubravcic,"They alluded to an easy to access free quiz with the ad on Instagram I clicked on to find out what kind of adhd you have (only after installing an app which the ad didn‚Äôt make clear), navigating a bunch of subscribe now malarkey, and then answering multiple questions in the actual quiz , it still didn‚Äôt give me results on the type of adhd I have without paying up for either a subscription or a one time report fee. I don‚Äôt like it when apps aren‚Äôt up front about this kind of thing. You need to rethink your ad strategy."
5,LilHohndo,When I was in school I never liked school. But I was always smart because I tried. But when I got out I stopped using my brain as much and feel like my brain sharpness started slowing down until I found this app. And feels like my brains a little quicker day by day
3,NikiKoub,"I have become pretty hooked on the crossword game, and find the challenges and puzzles engaging and fun.  It has become very clear through the crossword game that whoever is responsible for creating the puzzles has a strong religious background, based on the word choice and the words not deemed words (as bonuses).  In this day and age I find that a bit heavy handed and would have given a higher rating were it not for that."
4,NMC :(,I‚Äôm not a sudoku person. I don‚Äôt like Wordle. They‚Äôre not for me. These games are very and presentation in difficulty in every way that they can be. You‚Äôre not playing the same game over and over and over. It‚Äôs been pretty challenging. I think these sorts of things are super important to keep your brain and nervous system engaged as you get older. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Give it a try.
5,Nurse_Nae,I wasn‚Äôt too sure when I down loaded it Heather or not it would be worth my time or even worth using any of the space on my phone. Most brain training apps get deleted shortly after I get them because I lose interest but I must say I am impressed with this one.  I really enjoy the app and can‚Äôt wait to play daily.
5,London Joy!,"These challenges are fun and keep you focused, teach you how to focus, to increase your brain power.  When you think it‚Äôs easy, you trip up!  You learn about your focus ability.  Also, great games to challenge your memory skills.  Learn how to sharpen your skills in what you see in an instant, and then recall. Love this brain power strengthening app."
5,Tm2danc,I never buy games but I decided to on this one because I wanted to improve my brain power in a number of areas.  Attention span most importantly but so many other areas too.  I love the games and I sometimes play for hours at night on the challenging puzzles. Definitely work my one time purchase!
1,finepokwsop,Don‚Äôt waste your time if you are looking to play this game for free. They will lock your interests and continue to ask you to subscribe while hiding the close but so that it almost seems like there is no other choice. There are also frequent ads. These are people that understand how the brain works and they are trying to use that information against you to influence you to pay for something you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. I would never consider the paid version if this is how they treat their free users.
1,Rye1016,"The app in itself is entertaining, but I initially bought it based on an AD from impulse Indicating that they have certain personality and character tests that they do not have! Like I said, the puzzles and games are entertaining but I got the app for the personality tests and they are severely lacking. Stop advertising tests that the app doesn‚Äôt offer. Wish I could get a refund!! The developer responded insinuating that I was on the demo/free plan, that is not the case! I paid for the full year, like I said FALSE advertising!!! It doesn‚Äôt offer everything that they advertise"
5,Kk fun brain games,This app is really fun and also helps to strengthen your brain. We should always challenge our brain health and these games do just that. It also can keep you become accountable each day and although it‚Äôs a game its also a fun way to break away from the mundane of everyday.
4,Plumberxyourmum_fandom,"I love that it intellectually stimulates my brain, but this app is very similar to other apps. ‚ÄòImpulse‚Äô tells me that my intelligence quotient is at 139. I know my brain isn‚Äôt at that quotient, and I dislike when tests overestimate my score to give me a higher self-esteem. I‚Äôm using my score to help me improve, not to have my confidence improve. I don‚Äôt want my brain to get overwhelmed by an unrealistic standard."
5,Gabyyyy :)),"This is fabulous! When I first downloaded this, I didn‚Äôt see how this could help me improve my memory, but having this app for a few months now, I see a difference. I have a way better time remembering things. To whomever created this app, a big shoutout!! I will definitely recommend this to my friends :))))"
4,JRCGENX,"Overall solid program. A few idiosyncrasies with the idioms. Phrases said in one part of the world might be slightly different other places and the configuration doesn‚Äôt take that into consideration. For example. ‚ÄúPut in ones two cents‚Äù & ‚ÄúPut ones two cents in‚Äù are similar and both appropriate, however the game states one is incorrect."
5,Sobo1084,"I have a lot of members in my family losing their memory as they age , i notice a lot of me in them so I‚Äôm trying to break the cycle. This makes it fun and makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing something  productive.   Also all the test options are really helpful for self care and working on self in general."
4,mcholtzclaw,"I just started but it‚Äôs good to test your brain to stay sharp. With mental illness on the rise and the feelings of inadequacy many Americans suffer from these days, I feel that this is helpful. Just wish it was free. Good on the creators for providing good content for people to subscribe to. Can‚Äôt blame them because we live in a free market where you have to make money to thrive."
5,whos.emeraldz,"Impulse is great because they give you new challenges everyday to train your mind, they also have different varieties of games to choose from. They have tests to see if you have ADHD, and others, they can also quiz your IQ, and determine your IQ class, so overall, this app is great to use when you want to train your mind."
1,G a l a x y 123,"I purchased the lifetime access in early June 2023 and this app is still charging me weekly. When I try to submit for a refund the site (Apple?) will only let me go back as far as last month to submit a request for refunds. The charges I was able to submit for are still pending, but there is no way to contact Impulse to get the other charges that they purposely did AFTER my lifetime charge on Jun 3, 2023. Can someone at Impulse reach out to me to make this right? This is ridiculous and feels like a scam!"
1,Gonezpini,"I dos not even accept the free trial and the game opened when I tried to exit the plan options page. It tells I have a free trial that must be cancelled before it expires but it does not tell me when it expires. I have tried to cancel the free-trial /subscription in all possible ways but it doesn‚Äôt let me. It tells me to contact support but there is no phone number/ email or anything on the app or online. I better not be charged!  Update: WHY ISN‚ÄôT APPLE TAKING HANDS ON THIS MATTER?  GMRD the developer of this app never responds to emails but gladly continues to charge, their website has a support contact box but when you hit send a small box with an OK shows up‚Ä¶ without sending the message.  There are hundreds of dialogs with apple support of people asking how to cancel this and Apple‚Äôs response is useless.  Apple App Store is allowing scammers to take Apple users money."
5,BradWilliamsJ,"This is one of the best most competitive, brain improvement, challenges I‚Äôve seen and I love the ability to compete against others and see where you stand against other people in the same age brackets. There are many IQ tests and other cognitive testing that is totally worth the money! Keep it up!"
2,Not for anxious minds,Anytime you make a game that puts you against a clock ‚Ä¶.for most folks causes an increased stress response. I‚Äôm not paying for something that left me worse off than when I started. Then your test results are shown against the same population of people and it shows you where you rank. Sometimes you‚Äôre 98% better than those of the same age group - sometimes only 8%. So now you feel anxious and stupid. Lol no thanks - I can go to work and get laid for that!
5,Joedeertae1,Don‚Äôt play this game before bed. You won‚Äôt be able to go to sleep. Brain goes into  overdrive .  Excellent workout. Love it! A must download. Technology has put us in a drone state of mind . This is a great app to keep your brains motor functions hitting on all cylinders. Google is not going answer or to do this for you!! Put in the work and keep your mind sharp.
5,Kynzie pronounced; kense,"I am loving impulse so far! (Even since I have only had it for 2 days.) I have LOVED the games! But the only thing I would change is making all of the games free to play. Sure the free ones are good, but there are still a TON of games you have to subscribe for. But still, that‚Äôs the only thing I would change. Other than that it‚Äôs AMAZING!!"
5,imasilhouette121,"I can feel my brain expanding as each day passes. Memories and skills that had been locked within my dormant mind now come to light. I am more powerful than I‚Äôve ever been and it‚Äôs only been 2 days! Soon I shall have the mental fortitude to escape to the immaterial plane. Until that day, this app will prove most useful."
5,Savannah&Karol,"I absolutely love this app for brain training, although you can‚Äôt fully get everything unless you pay, there is still plenty that is free. Currently I am doing the seven day training plan I like it a lot but I always have to start at a kindergarten level and that‚Äôs kind of annoying. In all I would say this is a great app!‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,CHICAGOgang,"Tell me something that is wrong with these games. They did an great job developing this app and I just downloaded it. Overtime I might get tired of these games, but I know I‚Äôm gonna be playing them for a while until then, especially since I bought the full version. I want a sharp brain and if you do too, use this app!"
5,AveryBellaL,It may be hard but it has been really fun to play! It starts off sometimes easy and gets hard it allows your brain to think and move quickly! You can also play daily games and then after play more games after that! It‚Äôs very fun and I think y‚Äôall who haven‚Äôt played it should play!
5,Katiebobatie original,As ive gotten older and been glued to my phone more and more i have felt a lot dumber. This game is helping me use my brain in a more productive way and I like that :) the games are simple yet efficient and the personal quizzes have shown me a lot about myself I would‚Äôve never thought before. Overall love the app!
1,_SMG_,"You RARELY ever play a game here. It‚Äôs literally ad after ad after ad after ad after ad, 30 second game, ad, ad, ad, ad and another ad. What‚Äôs worse is the ads are all at least 30 seconds, some a minute, and when they finish they wait another 20 seconds or so before you even can click the X to exit the ad and bring up the next ad. Then some other ads don‚Äôt even have an X show up, they force you to click on it in order to get to the next screen. This is just an advertising app, nothing good."
5,Zzekyy,It tells you what you are strong at and tells you your weaknesses. Weaknesses not to feel bad but to target as something to work on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Which by the way this app can support in growth of those weakness. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this exactly but I‚Äôm glad I subscribed to Impulse. Give it a shot!
5,DerickStaciTaylor,"As a person who struggles with anxiety, ADHD, and mediumship (Yup, I‚Äôm one of those people who the deceased talk to/through) ‚Äî this app has helped with attention and awareness.   I‚Äôm able to focus and the exercise it provides helps me with daily tasks that are usually more difficult to accomplish.   My memory has improved immensely since I began my training with this app.  If anything, I suggest going pro with the annual plan.   As the levels increase, some are blocked without it!  Overall, I‚Äôve suggested it to numerous people in my family and friends.   They tried it and some have even kept the app.  Thank you!"
2,koalacarrie,"This brain training app is so far inferior, especially compared to other apps, like Elevate. This app, Impulse, presents the exact same tests over and over again, day after day. I am sorry that I subscribed. Canceled after less than a week when I realized how simplistic and boring it is. It‚Äôs extremely monosyllabic, with very little graphic content, and FAR from what I would describe as engaging (or helpful, beyond the first day of use). I definitely do not recommend."
5,DoubleBluff007,"I often feel like I am not challenging my mind and exploring my weaknesses. Impulse offers me many ways to do both. I‚Äôve since learned more about how my mind works, what I‚Äôm good at and what I‚Äôm not.  I hope to use Impulse to improve my skills at work and to help me introspect on my emotional weaknesses to improve relationships."
5,Michi89410,"I usually don‚Äôt buy into these type of apps as they don‚Äôt usually help with my severe adhd, but I decided to give this one a try as it looked pretty interesting. The games are perfect and are actually fun and addicting. There are also some tests/quizzes which are also really fun. Definitely worth it to try this app out."
1,Dirt_boy,"Games are fun and challenging, but when it comes how you compare to others in your age group, it laughably bad. You‚Äôre either better than 99% of your peers or zero percent. Today I got one wrong at a higher level and it said I was better than zero percent while yesterday I was perfect in the same game and I was better than 99%. Needs work. Also, figuring out how to cancel or modify your subscription is so difficult it is bordering on fraud. There are a lot better games out there for same amount of money. Choose wisely"
5,VRamzguy,"I feel as though the app knows me by now. Like, when slack off a few days, then I get a notification on some exercises I just ‚Äúknow‚Äù I‚Äôm going to pass with flying colors. I pass‚Ä¶ then I miss that one,but the interesting challenges and smooth transitions of the lesson/session itself makes this app that much more fun to interact with!! I love it!"
5,Osbornjl71,"I needed something not too hard or time consuming to keep my abilities sharp and this app really fits the bill. The games are quick, not frustrating by being too hard or too easy and you can squeeze in a little exercise while waiting in line, etc."
5,cassette1234,"It can be hard to find a game suitable for OCD, ADHD, and autism. This game showcases the different impulses the brain desires. Usually I have to have music, a show, or a movie in the background, and i go from tik tok to instagram to one of my many app games and none of them suit my needs. But this way I can have everything and just switch within the game!!! 10/10"
5,LexMacayla09,"Impulse has so many activities that make you actually use your brain. I recommend for when your bored, not bored, wanting a challenge, wanting an easy but fun game, etc. There are multiple games in this app and you will be excited to get back to this app every time you get off of it."
5,applepoepoe,Aside from being asked to pay(like all apps these days) the FREE games are dope. I did the IQ test and yes I did pay for it. I‚Äôm vain and wanted to see how smart I am. I got 132. According to the app that‚Äôs gifted. My girl got 129 lol. She got the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù title though. So though my score was higher now she can lord over me that she‚Äôs ‚Äúsuperior.‚Äù Haha I love it. Real great app. Lowkey I may pay for the sub
4,twilighto9,"I am recovering from a stroke. This app has tests that help my memory, math and peripheral short comings. All of them are hard for me but I see improvement happening. The other thing I noticed is that I do better in areas that I think are impossible to do. It helps me realize I am doing better then I think and it helps me have more grace for myself and hope"
5,xX≈†L√ÅY√äRXx,"This is the best brain game I have ever played it has actually helped and I haven‚Äôt even noticed till somebody had mentioned it to me. I think it is a great way to train your brain and to focus more on the unthinkable. Like people are always on there phone no one ever reads anymore, well I think an hour of this game and you should be good!"
4,Gogodap,I had previously written a 1 star review bc of the difficulty in reaching customer service. I‚Äôm happy to report that customer service did finally reach out and worked diligently to resolve my issue. I really enjoy the games and appreciate learning how to reach customer service. Still a little salty about the initial issues which were very time consuming to resolve.
5,RandalJohnson607,"It‚Äôs been helping increase my memory and focus! I see a big difference and it helps me unwind with the games! Definitely worth trying! I noticed a difference in memory, focus and decision making in a few weeks! It measures your progress so you know how far you‚Äôve come and what to work on!"
1,Cl1210,"I signed up for the free trial to test out the app. This did open quite a range of things for me to try out - it‚Äôs quite enjoyable. Among them, an IQ test. This was a 60 question/ 20 min test and, at the end, it gave a score.  I could see the score but would only allow me to access the report if I signed up for an ongoing membership. This immediately turned me off.  What is the purpose of a free trial if I cannot access portions of the app? What else would I have to pay extra for even if I signed up for an ongoing subscription? Immediately canceled my free trial."
1,SoulSteeper101,"The sub cost more a month than your Netflix. You can take some of the tests on the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù but to see results you must subscribe. So is it really a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù or is it a 3 day see what we can do for $20+ a month. Free trials usually let you have full access, considering they charge you if you try it and forget to cancel it. Dishonest imo, I might have subbed if it was a full access free trial, but it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a solid business plan to cash in on ppl, but I usually lean towards rewarding good customers not companies looking for a quick buck from passerby‚Äôs"
5,TheoneandonlyChris69,"Impulse Brain Training is a game-changer! The app's intuitive interface and diverse exercises keep me engaged and challenged. Its personalized approach targets my strengths and weaknesses, while progress tracking motivates me to excel. This app is a must-have for anyone serious about enhancing cognitive function. Five stars‚ÄîImpulse Brain Training exceeds expectations!"
4,SteveTy166,Downloaded this app to try it out.  It‚Äôs cool but it started looking like too many ways to get money from me so I decided to delete it an hour after I got it.  Problem is I‚Äôm not seeing it anywhere in my subscriptions‚Ä¶.  I just want to delete this app before the first payment.  It‚Äôs an ok app just not for me.
4,Mommof3+,"It seems like some of the games would be easy, thinking back to elementary math, but they‚Äôll sneak up on you. I am no brain scientist but it feels like something is going on inside the cobwebs of my brain. I did not think I had too many of those but it seems it‚Äôs finding them. The only thing I would say is there does seem to be a bit of an agenda going on."
2,Steph_329,"While this app is entertaining (and personally nice to have and play on an airplane), it is not where the ads on Instagram say it is. I was advertised as an app to help you dive into things like adhd and trauma and I was immediately disappointed to find it was minimally addressing those things. They advertised quizzes that were game based, and I have yet to find any. There are also a lot less quizzes than expected, overall. Save your money. Do not get the subscription."
5,Kshrouer,This game is fun if you are highly anxious like me. Just a couple minutes of playing some mind challenging games takes my mind off of all the tasks I need to accomplish in a day.. helps me to reset and refocus and be more productive ‚Ä¶ if you like quick brain challenges this is for you
1,Cadabra,"The games are fun but the ‚Äúcompared score to others in your age range‚Äù is a joke. You can get 80-98% correct and it‚Äôll say compared to others you are 0% ü§£ like, what. It only takes a few accounts to hack and get super high scores (like every other game app) amd them the curve is sky high leaving everyone else getting 0%. Makes no sense. Most if the time you‚Äôll either get 99% or 0% lol.  But again. The games are fun. Its good to keep the brain active just dont get discouraged at 0% score. You‚Äôre doing great!"
1,DSpring25,"After completing one of the personality tests online to determine my archetype, and after enabling the free trial which is the weekly fee, it did not allow me to see the results. It led me to believe it would not ask me to purchase the yearly plan in order to see my results. Also, the variations of these tests are two answer questions with very little variety or thought whatsoever. It uses methods pertaining back to Carl Jung but it does so very cheaply and with no deeper thought. Nothing sets the app apart from a free online quiz center. Extremely overpriced and underwhelming."
5,Moni753,It‚Äôs great for testing you brains ability to process and remember information. We tend to go to the gym or walk and run to keep our body in shape why shouldn‚Äôt we do the same for our mind/brain. I like the games and information and the fact it can help with anxiety as well is a big plus for me!!
5,BeGeebers,"I am going to turn 71 in a few days and am beginning to lose track of my memory due only to old age and lack of stimulus from being almost all alone in a strange city. I‚Äôve not been able to meet people and to make friends. I don‚Äôt watch tv, preferring to read instead."
1,TryAnotherNickName756,"If this is brain training then so is candy crush. Slapping the title brain training on some games a child could play and telling your audience that they are ""better than 90% of their piers!"" is genius. 30 question IQ test, 25 question AHDH diagnosis. Yeah right. If this is what you settle for, then the TV remote and microwave buttons are also brain training for numbers and calculation. Maybe social media scroll is brain training. I'm doing spelling training typing a review. If only I could watch some ads or pay money to have someone pat me on the back for it."
5,ellolowoman,"I downloaded impulse because I wanted a game that would exercise my mind, and evaluate my thinking and this app does exactly that. Impulse has fun games and great quick feedback. I love the simple design and the variety. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to do pointless activities and enjoys puzzles!"
1,Jayziggy25,The app is great but the process to end your subscription is terrible. Since I did not subscribe through the App Store you have to search for a way to unsubscribe and then it doesn‚Äôt even work. I tried to unsubscribe before my 7 day free trial was up and I didn‚Äôt hear anything from the company. I tried to contact them at least 2 different ways and still nothing and I still ended up being charged the the subscription that I was trying to cancel before I was supposed to be charged.
4,Dooted‚ÄônZooted,"So far, it‚Äôs a good app. I‚Äôm only on the second day of training, but the games are easy to stay focused on and help me feel like I‚Äôm making progress. Not that I‚Äôm clinically recommending it, but it does seem to help me focus more as someone diagnosed with ADHD. Might not help all cases of it, but it is right now. I‚Äôd recommend doing the trial first then deciding to if you want to pay for it before committing of course."
5,1banaltra,Finally a game app that is what it claims. I‚Äôve enjoyed the simple games as they increase with challenges. I find myself getting back to this app when I‚Äôm in a waiting room or such places like the car service department to help stay awake üòâ.  I‚Äôm older so I think this helps with speed/timing.
4,TravviusPattius,This app is insane so far and I am using it every day to keep my brain sharp in several areas. It could have some more games and it would be cool if they added meditative and mindfulness based games as well. There are other parts to the brain that aren‚Äôt enhanced on this app but I‚Äôm sure with time they will work on them. Absolutely suggest just buying the lifetime deal.
5,BuzzmanKB,There are numerous brain building apps out there. I have played a few of them. This one is both similar and different. The aesthetics are very pleasing. The exercises are not entirely new. Even with the subscription model with zero ads or just free with the ads it runs smoothly. It is not pushy and feels welcoming. Absolutely worth your time.
5,B1rdTheW0rd,I‚Äôve only been playing it for a few days but I love it. It‚Äôs way more affordable than other brain training apps that I‚Äôve tried and the games are great. It feels much more organized and I enjoy the games a lot more than Elevate for example. I have a feeling I‚Äôll be able to stick to this more easily.
5,Lilahdream,"I really love playing Impulse because it helps me understand that I am smarter than I thought. I can see as I‚Äôm go through more levels I‚Äôm training my brain to be successful I‚Äôm only in fifth grade practicing on 13-17,I am actually a straight A Student and I am ready to go. But one thing I would like to change about impulse is the age performance üòÅüòÅ"
5,MattNKara516,"After several rounds it becomes more and more difficult. The challenges are different therefore ultimately fun. Keeps you on your toes and you definitely have to think from time to time. I have not played enough to notice a difference, however I can already tell the game is helpful."
5,david money,"I know most people don‚Äôt look at the reviews, and if they do they don‚Äôt believe their real people. Well I actually like impulse. I use it every other day. It helps my brain stay sharp. Also things most people don‚Äôt do is write reviews, well that just goes to  on show how good the app is, if I‚Äôm writing a review about it."
5,Okkk.,I had this app I think about a week now and only used it twice but I think it will be beneficial for your brain if you use it everyday so far I did math memory and attention span only in 10 mins and doing that everyday we help your brain function better I think.
5,Blondeleah,I guess it must be the kid and me that comes out so I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to explain why but I just love the sorting game and games like this on Impulse. It‚Äôs especially fun when you get a high score and that gives me a quick confidence boosters and just makes me feel a little smarter after playing a few rounds!
1,Michael8991234579476527767,"The games were kinda fun, but I only got it for the brain teasers which don‚Äôt even let you answer the question on your own; they just make you stare at it and then when you think you know the answer you press ‚Äúshow answer‚Äù and it just tells you. I gave it 1 star because I did not know it was going to cost money until I noticed a charge from my pay pal. Apparently it went ahead and charged me for a subscription that I did not at all sign up for. Luckily it was only $7 but still I think it‚Äôs incredibly shady that they charged me without my knowledge."
5,Fhs8,I was nervous at first as I didn‚Äôt even want to admit that I was losing memory and words were not coming to me as easily as they had previously. I found it easy to use. Not intimidating and the tests were just a bonus. Super fun with convenience of course 10 minutes a day!
5,limitlessthoughts,"This app is more then I expected because I have downloaded many different brain apps, and this one actually stimulates your brain and has fun activities. It also allows if you can‚Äôt afford it to start off with a free version to experience it. Thank App Development Team üôè"
5,EM of CO,"I‚Äôm not into games. This piqued my interest with the personality assessments, complimented by various games to spark mental activity rather than aimlessly scrolling through social media for hours on end. Each tiny victory adds up, and motivation sets in with relevant comparisons to others in your age bracket. Beware, it‚Äôs addictive!"
5,I'm obsessed,"I‚Äôve never been one for phone games, but this truly takes the cake. I feel like it‚Äôs a nice distraction for my anxious/chaotic thoughts when I need something calming to focus on, and helps me become more mentally in-tune in the long run. I can see this being a part of my daily routine for many years to come."
5,sunnydetime,"The activities are fun and engaging. They keep your brain active and make you think. However, unlike some other brain stimulating apps, there was no frustration here. I welcome the areas where I need improvement and look forward to a higher score the next go round."
4,brachjason,"I switched from Elevate to Impulse recently and while Impulse has a larger variety of problem solving games, Elevate gives you tips if you‚Äôre struggling on a game. Impulse doesn‚Äôt give tips so it‚Äôs harder to learn effectively. Can the developers add tips and anything else to foster improvement instead of just repeating something you can‚Äôt figure out how to solve?"
4,Alesia411,I  a stroke survivor so I need the brain stimulation the only problem for me is it is  way to expensive for me to keep going on and get the full effect of how it will help. I wish there was a version for survivors of brain injury‚Äôs for free or really cheap. I can not work and I am on a fixed income barely making it. I want to give it a five  but I can‚Äôt because to expensive.
5,Oceanbrew,"Starts off simple which I really enjoyed starting classes online soon, so I wanted to see where I was at cause I haven‚Äôt been to school in a long time and it showed me. I have a lot to practice on, but I was grateful to have some thing that I didn‚Äôt have to pay for to help me you know, warm up my brain."
5,Tkpro13tom,Impulse is a fun game to sharpen your skills in various ways. Quick bath and identification scenarios will assist you to be more observant and problem solve. Mistakes are accounted for so you don‚Äôt get off easy. The app provides a useful way to spend time when you aren‚Äôt doing anything else. You will make time to play the games.
1,Boredouttamyflippingmind,"They trap you by making you sign up for their ‚Äúfree‚Äù 3 day trial. Then it automatically charges you if you do not cancel it. However there is no quick and painless way to cancel the subscription at this time. You have to jump through hoops and give your left Thumb to even figure how to begin to cancel it. NOT an Honest App. I‚Äôd rather have a true free trial and then if I like it hit a button to keep it. Beware of apps like this, they are banking on you forgetting or getting frustrated and just paying for it."
5,Intorko,"While I wish this was a free or less costly app, I must admit I do enjoy it. The only downside is it‚Äôs an annual membership when there are free apps available or games like Brain Academy for a one time purchase of $30 or less on sale. Other than cost, this app is amazing. And if you don‚Äôt mind paying, it‚Äôs worth it."
5,Lulapandora,I am always wanting to challenge my brain especially not working a day job! It‚Äôs great to keep my brain sharp! But I like how it tells me how I match up to my peers! It‚Äôs a good guideline on how much I can improve or to impress myself on how good i‚Äôm doing! I know people always say never compare yourself but I think they do it in a gentle way!
5,‚ù§ C h e r r y ‚ù§,"Very convenient app to use when on the go. I use it on the commute to/from work or when I‚Äôm standing in line for something, and I must say I feel much more motivated when I see that my score has improved in a specific cognitive area. Looking forward to future updates of the app!"
5,Nicholas James Campbell,"This app is telling me nothing with self-discipline determination, willpower the level of intelligence that I didn‚Äôt know that I had if you‚Äôre looking for a daily challenge something to make you feel guilty. If you don‚Äôt do it in a reason to pick up your phone is actually beneficial download this app."
5,B Shirk,"If you have trouble with basic brain function due to high amounts of stress and trauma, this app is for you! It tests you on different types of brain function. It starts at a kindergarten easy level and then you work your way up to harder and harder challenges!"
5,dreadpurse,"I appreciate the app trying to accommodate each user and I really like that the app gives them challenges they can handle!   Honestly, I‚Äôm not a fan of math‚Äî honestly if there‚Äôs a way to exercise the brain without using math then I‚Äôd be happier for it, haha.   but I do like that the app teaches the users about the human brain. It‚Äôs very helpful!"
5,beno√Æt the brotagonist,"I seldom write reviews, but this app is beyond fantastic. As someone who is sick of perpetual subscription models, I love the fact that you can make a one-time purchase. $50 seemed steep at first - but the games, puzzles, and quizzes are seemingly endless. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be more proactive with their screen time, rather than endlessly doom scrolling. üôèüèº"
5,feetnite,If you struggle at school just download this game to remind your brain on some activities you be doing at school it‚Äôs like a quick reminder and it starts up your brain on little things to then big things instead of rushing at the big things the point is it‚Äôs nice to warm up your brain and train
5,IssaNessa,This game is completely different from all the other apps I used. It‚Äôs got my full attention when playing and honestly look forward to playing. I believe this will help give my brain the extra boost it needs and definitely will be adding the app to the kids phone.
5,Ssmith9994,I have had the worst brain fog since getting covid a year ago.  This game was recommended to me by my doctor who said I need to keep my brain thinking and problem solving to get myself back to normal. I would tell everyone to buy this app and play few minutes each day to help restore cognitive thinking
5,üòéMickeyüòú,"The app is just amazing, it runs smoothly, has tons of mind games, it is very easy to use, and it is FREE! It sure has ads but they aren‚Äôt as persistent as in other apps, plus they don‚Äôt pop up every single second, and by not a lot of money you can buy the unlimited access and it is just‚Ä¶ awesome ‚òïÔ∏è"
5,Yeehawsome!!,"The app is so well curated that I find myself drifting throughout the day for the positive reinforcement that comes with mental exercise.  The IQ test made me consider that I‚Äôm capable of more than I had initially believed.  The games are fun, the content is great and I love this app. I‚Äôm certainly a raving fan here and have told a few people about it already"
5,Me$$ala,"I saw this app in an ad one day and didn‚Äôt think anything of it but i actually downloaded it, and that‚Äôs when i started trying out the daily tasks. Doing the daily tasks are super fun and innovative and my brain thoroughly enjoys the time i‚Äôve spent since i‚Äôve gotten accustomed to using and understanding this cool app. üòÅ"
2,Junior BRPO,"Chame on you stealing from everyone knowing that after delete this app you will still charge people,apple should and will be hold accountable for allowing you developers to steal money from apple clients,$2.99 to stop all ads and everyone get the ads in each new level hahaha good one I‚Äôm a lawyer and will confront apple and developers regarding this in legal action, yes I read all your disclaimers and fine print, I know what I find out and will use it again you and apple App Store."
5,Gabby Rohr,I have been struggling with my school life. It has always been hard to focus or to remember something small‚Ä¶ But impulse is helping me to keep track and to get my mind stronger!!! One of the most helpful apps on my phone. So if you are having the same problems as me then I recommend you get this.
1,wishfulphoenix123,Updated- I received an email from the developer saying family share isn‚Äôt available. So be careful not to drop $40 on an app you can‚Äôt share w your family bc you can‚Äôt get a refund and it states NO where in the information that it can‚Äôt be shared!!   Hi! I love this app and my daughter has started playing it too. I purchased the pro version but it won‚Äôt show in family share for her to download the full version. I only spent so much bc I thought we would be able to share it. Please help.
5,doesn'tmatterwhatisay,It‚Äôs still the beginning phase of me using the app but immediately I‚Äôm engaged and excited to do more activities. There is only so much time in the day and something that takes the time you want it to is perfect and you can always increase or decrease to fit your time and lifestyle
5,Nachoforlife,I thoroughly enjoy the game it makes me think a lot more than what I normally have to in helps me process a lot of what I do now because I gave makes you think so much which is what you want and that‚Äôs why I really like this game because that‚Äôs what I was looking for something a challenge me in this game really challenges you.
5,GiselQuevdo,"I actually love training my brain I have many games so far and this one actually motivates me to keep going because I don‚Äôt want to lose my streak. It‚Äôs really simple and very fun to do! It shows how to do the games first and then let‚Äôs you improve. I realllyyy like to keep my brain going, so if you‚Äôre like me this is the game for you!!"
5,Capinij,I love to learn and the only thing that helped was watching repeat Jeopardy shows. This app is insane and I‚Äôm addicted. I can‚Äôt stop playing! My memory has improved and my thinking has improved. Thank you for developing this app its a lot better than the Mensa app I purchased 8 years ago.
5,Focus 2.5,"It‚Äôs always a good idea to keep the main frame in focus, and since, I‚Äôm at the tinder age of 65, I, definitely want to keep my main frame, oiled, and running on all cylinders. The, world that, I, was raised in is vastly changing on a daily, basis  and, if you don‚Äôt stay focused and on, your A, game, if not you either get left behind, or stepped, or stomped on"
1,Fantasylover,"If you want the commercial free version of this game it will cost you well more than twice as much as Netflix every month. Ridiculous and stupid. If you go for the free version, be prepared to be bombarded by ads between every game. The commercials last longer than the actual game play. The ads are for gambling games. This game is merely a come-on to sell you into the losing world of internet bingo. I could understand $10 for a year subscription. This is stupid and so are you if you pay for this product."
1,Llama2.00009,"This game makes me more angry then calm. This game is supposed to make me feel calm and make my ADHD more controlled. After I tried to play a game I was sent to pay for a month or a year. I should not have to pay any money to calm my ADHD down this is the most stupidest scam I ever seen. If you don‚Äôt want to go broke because this game is stupid find a game that you can organize things to calm yourself down, adds are better than having to pay to calm your ADHD down. Moral of the story, don‚Äôt download if you don‚Äôt want to go broke and/or get angrier and not calm your ADHD."
5,its all about my king,"I‚Äôve been using Impulse for a while now, and I must say that I‚Äôm impressed with the app‚Äôs personalized training. The app focuses on certain parts of my brain, such as problem-solving, creativity, concentration, attention, and memory, and offers a variety of ways to perform mental training daily by playing amusing mind games  ."
5,MrsMoye,I‚Äôve been using the app when I feel anxiety building up or when I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôve also been using it at bedtime. The activities and diagnostics are the perfect way to ease anxiety and wind down. It has also helped my confidence level and my sense of accomplishment each day.
4,Oli1060,I am currently on the free trial. I love the games I am able to play. They are very fun and I can see how they can help distract you from anxiety. However I was hoping to see the tests and maybe I would actually subscribe. If I could see how this app would actually help me improve I would subscribe. The free trial only lets you play without the knowledge on how to improve.
2,wadesterk,"The app indicates you have full/free access during the 3 day trial period. You do not. Immediately upon completing tests they begin wanting money to unlock results. The testing is good with apt questions which is why 2 stars.  The lies, however, make those two stars as far as they go.  Logically this means their sole reason for granting the 3 day access is the hope some poor sap forgets and they then get to zap the person for right at $60.  Do not forget to unsubscribe would be my advice."
5,Lisa P. from IN,I am new to impulse so still learning how to use it but it is easier each time. I like all the games and puzzles I have tried so far even ones I didn‚Äôt think I would like. It‚Äôs great to get the messages to prompt you to play. I am glad to have this as part of my new routine though out the day. Lisa P
5,HussNasty,"Played the first three games and I love it. Unless it‚Äôs a complete hoax and the makers of this game are in cahoots to mess with me. I need to find out more about myself! Unfortunately, I may have to pay for this subscription. Which I do not do generally on purpose. Definitely guilty of accidental subscriptions and follow up pleading phone calls. Lol"
5,Pudgie McGee,"I love this app! I‚Äôve always enjoyed logic puzzles and pattern puzzles, so I was really excited to play it. What‚Äôs even better is that it works at whatever level I‚Äôm working with! I don‚Äôt have to worry about it being too easy. It gets challenging quickly. It‚Äôs only been a few days, but I‚Äôm addicted!"
5,James Geiser,"Whether it‚Äôs short, moderate, or long form brain exercises, this game has it all. Plus, it explains what each game is meant to help you with, and analyzes the data from your previous scores in order to further tailor future games. I‚Äôm only a couple days in but I like it a lot so far."
5,ùíúùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìÉùìéùìÇ‚Ñ¥ùìäùìà,My memory has improved greatly since I started using the app. I have even began to become more attentive to my surroundings. I appreciate how the creators always ask in what ways they can help make the user‚Äôs experience better for us. I am grateful and will continue use!
5,Bright09,"i‚Äôve completed tower of hoari like five times on different accounts, i‚Äôve completed max sliding puzzles twice and i‚Äôve done all 480 levels of robotic flows. so don‚Äôt get me wrong i love the game, however it‚Äôs sorta easy. i wish after i had beaten sliding puzzles a different harder puzzles appeared, and so on with every other game."
4,Julia Mas,This app is very fun and good for your brain but the only thing is that you have to pay for almost everything. Other than that for the seven day trial it is good for learning and quizzing your brain. There are also IQ tests to see what you get and then it gives a pretty accurate anwser. I would get this game but wouldn‚Äôt pay like the $70 a year but should try to 7 day trial.
5,NB Kate,I look forward to these every day. I like to start my day with the planned games and us random games to refocus throughout the day. I also recommend this to my clients especially any of my more mature who have noticed a dip in their memory and the improvements have been notable.
4,Kale‚Äôa,"I like is this because I can‚Äôt really help with Claire ministry and making it more or even stay more stronger and smarter especially when you‚Äôre out of school during summer break, you could lose a lot of knowledge so doing this without my brain, connect more faster with thinking in making decisions and is staying on the basic facts on things!"
5,Ace of Diamondz,"This has a lot of little puzzles and games I like to play all in one, and I feel like I could really improve doing these quizzes. Whether it‚Äôs helping my memory or helping with math problems. Definitely recommend. I also got a slight discount which is crazy so totally worth my money in my opinion."
5,stuckinthepast,This is great for my dear sweet neurodivergent brain! By playing these helping games that make my attention away from the learning (since I have to work on not counting with my hands) and gaining! I highly recommend to anyone who has neuro-divergent brains who wants all the fun and learning - with out the school class room feel!
5,Agowatiha,I‚Äôve really enjoyed using this app. It‚Äôs really helped me focus and concentrate again. After having as many concussions as I‚Äôve had it‚Äôs been difficult to use cognitive functions as I once have. This app seems to be helping with that. Can‚Äôt wait to solve the next problem! Thank you.
4,Daego85,"This app is phenomenal, especially on the days when I wake up, and I‚Äôm just groggy and not all there. I can turn on this app and within five minutes after a few games feel mentally alert. Highly suggest this application to any business professional or anyone looking to improve your mental capacity."
5,Btomkiw,"I am someone who loves a good puzzle game. And as a woman approaching my 60th birthday, I want to do everything possible to remain vital for the long haul. The puzzles in Impulse are both fun and increasing challenging. And the brain boost that comes from the various games is more than worth five minutes a day. This is now part of my every day workout routine."
5,salazar7515,Keeps working out my mind instead of just aimlessly playing video games that do nothing for me but waste time. Would recommend to everyone to try. Love the feature where it compres you to other people in the same age group making a little competition which I love.
5,BrainF0gM0m,I was looking for an app where I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with crappy ads and random notifications and this is it! The games are fun and I found myself remembering numbers at my job that I was struggling with previously. Highly recommend if you want something besides candy crush to play
3,Jasonmouse,"3 stars so ppl see it more, it‚Äôs honestly fun interactive games. Yes the price tag is scary but if you leave it and forget about it for like a week it‚Äôll give you crazy discounts like 96% off the yearly plan. Now if that was the base deal then I would be more inclined to be a repeat customer but understand that in times of massive wealth adversary we are facing at this time as a world, the deals really make or break customer loyalty and retention."
5,BoredomLifeYaKnow,"I just got the game a few days ago, but i really like it. I like that there is different games and challenges you can do. At first the games will seem easy but once you get on higher levels they actually begin to get challenging. Unlike some games where each level is practically the same."
2,CWCLT7,"When you first start the app, it seems you have to buy a subscription option. If you X that screen you get the free version‚Ä¶I‚Äôm thinking glad I tried clicking X because now I can try the app. Played a few rounds then SURPRISE!‚Ä¶I get an option to buy a subscription at a much lower price!  Shade. Not that I mind paying, but seems odd everyone gets a different deal. Shame because it seemed to have potential, though I‚Äôm not reading much in the reviews people‚Äôs real world benefits."
5,bdikehqojdbhsojdb,"I downloaded impulse when I looked for low storage games, found it and showed it to my friend. They played it for a minute or two and then downloaded it straight away. This is the best game for brain training, sleep, and reducing anxiety and stress. I would highly recommend it to anyone struggling with these items."
5,AlyssaAnderson89,I absolutely enjoy the different exercises that impulse offers and I like that they offer notifications to remind me everyday or how ever often I like. I also like when I open the app it says your training is ready for you it makes me feel like it‚Äôs made specifically for me.
5,Outshinebarber,"Great for training every part of the brain, everyone should be doing these exercises but since they aren‚Äôt I feel this will give you such an edge..it‚Äôs only day one and I can‚Äôt get enough of it, can‚Äôt wait to see how it molds my life going forward!"
5,J. Mike Rosner,"Love ‚Äòbrain Games‚Äô. This Seems good so far, challenging; I like it.  I‚Äôd been ‚Äòplaying‚Äô these-type ‚Äògames‚Äô for ~(seemingly) Years now. Impulse truly is a fantastic exercise which Feels much like a game.   My Severe TBI has improved exponentially since I‚Äôd begun my training regiment. Impulse has also become a regular aspect of my ‚Äòregular‚Äô recovery efforts now, as well!!"
1,Teakayjee,"Yeah, I‚Äôve had this app for a few weeks now, found it just searching through the App Store.  Since installing it I‚Äôve been bombarded with ads on Facebook that are completely irrelevant to what is actually in the app, the final straw was an ad where it implied there was some sort of personality quiz that would determine your ‚ÄúMale Archetype‚Äù whatever that means.  Not only was said ad irrelevant to the actual content in the app, it was completely nonsensical. It was a graph with the different ‚Äúmale archetypes‚Äù with several personality traits that said ‚Äúmale archetypes‚Äù have in varying degrees.  I‚Äôm not going to go through all of them, but ‚ÄúThe creator‚Äù ‚Äúmale archetype‚Äù had one of, if not the lowest score in creativity.  I have no idea what their intention with these ads are, but if it‚Äôs to get people who already use your app to delete it, then good job it worked."
1,Extremertab22,"I was trying out the 3 day trial right? The game already put a hold on the $7 or $6.99 if you wanna be specific, so I thought it was a little weird but whatever. After playing the game a little bit, the next day I cancelled the trial, because the game wasn‚Äôt my type of thing. Usually the money on hold should come back to my bank account a couple days after cancelling the trial, but it didn‚Äôt. The app stole my $7. It‚Äôs not a big deal but I‚Äôm a minor without a job so it felt like a lot of money to me even if it wasn‚Äôt."
5,Cor_rine52,Please update the test! Most of the questions I was right down the middle wanting to hit both options and a few of them were a neither for me. It would have been nice to have those other opportunities. I had figure out on my own where I actually placed.
5,drying Chloe fusion symbol,First you don‚Äôt have to be smart to play this. This game is made for to help you mentally.   Second it is actually Reilly fun in myOpinion if you don‚Äôt like it you can say things you don‚Äôt like about it just don‚Äôt say to not get this game. So IF YOU are interested in it it‚Äôs actually a really good game in my opinion again.
4,bgubjb,"Impulse is a great brain game! It is much better than many other games because it has a daily workout/goals set for you when you arrive. The games are fun, new,amd different! The reason this is not a 5 star review is because there are in app purchases but that is really the only downside I can see. I love this game and I will keep using it for a long time!!"
5,ryan soulcract,"I‚Äôve just been playing for a short while but I‚Äôm enjoying myself and already feel inspired to purchase, though it is nice they allow you to play for free with ads (if you can call that free). But yes I will play some more for sure and potentially buy, I imagine you may feel the same."
5,Naag Nool,This app hasn‚Äôt only given me some much needed confidence in my intellect and brain capacity but I love the games! And it feels great to accomplish the challenges. I recently heard of these two nuns that lived to be 100+ but with the memory and recollection of a 20 year old because they would complete puzzles/brain games. This is my goal & Impluse is helping me get there. ü•∞
5,KyraC103,"I really enjoy playing this game. It makes you think, and it gets your brain going. I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 5. It helps with different Types of weaknesses, that you would like to work on. It helps you focus, and helps u get better at anything you need to work on."
5,trevorsnarr,"This app is absolutely amazing! Bravo, to all the hard workers that put this together to make sure that our brains don‚Äôt go amok with the onset of AI.   We can all come together and make sure our brains continue to work despite the easiness of what technology provides us.   Let‚Äôs do this for our human brains!!üß†"
5,Orion's fly guy,"I have been retired 15 years now. And over the last few years I‚Äôve noticed a decline the speed with which I problem solve. I will now focus on one project at a time while ignoring other impactful issues. Good or bad? I don‚Äôt know. Also, remembering names of new people‚Ä¶faces‚Ä¶no problem."
5,sushdjdjxnsojdb,"Yes, I indeed gave this a five star review. Thanks to this app, I feel more confident and comfortable with different aspects of the world. This really made me think about what my life actually is. Please if you really are struggling call someone, but if you‚Äôre not that far, this app makes you feel calm, cool, and collected. Try this app!"
5,LegendSportsGRP,"Love this game so far, theres tons of different activities to and tools to use for sharpening memory and critical thinking skills, response times, hand/eye coordination etc. i can see my self enjoying this for a long time to come. Challenging and difficult at the same time as rewarding and entertaining."
4,dniseyp,I like the brain training games. Short and effective- because they are basic but challenging (even though they don‚Äôt feel like they should be- which makes me aware of my need to do these types of exercises! I would like having little scientific explanations of how they how they work. Like the science behind the activity.
5,BabyHerc15,This app is awesome!! Honestly it‚Äôs fun kills time gives you a great deal of self awareness of your skills and makes you want to improve all while helping your brain learn on so many levels. Highly recommend this to all ages young teenagers mid life and the old it‚Äôs a must get for anyone really! Nice work!
5,Daisysunkiss78,"Little mini games keep things fun while really honing in on your mental acuity, working memory, problem solving and so much more. No matter what kind of games you like, there‚Äôs sure to be something here for you and you will see a different in your mental abilities pretty quickly."
5,Eizzeee,This app is honestly the most useful tool for anyone wanting to improve their intellect & comprehension skills. I highly would recommend this app to everyone. The games are both entertaining and great for memorization skills. Tests give you results and statistics. The impulse app is refreshing againüíóüíóüíó I genuinely enjoy it!! DOWNLOAD
5,trishyann 74,With so much information and tasks sometimes you need a little extra help to ensure that you‚Äôre doing everything to exercise your cognitive strength. This helps with that while improving areas that you need to work on while being fun at the same time.
5,Q-Dog/Baby,"Parents should be aware that Impulse is a highly kid-friendly puzzle game with a low entrance barrier that offers a natural introduction to the physics of mass, velocity, and trajectory without being overtly didactic. It was intended to cover Newton's laws of motion and was created by researchers. But the gaming is challenging, and without support or a player base, young players can lose interest."
5,rezaroze,This app is really helping me to get it together to be able to stop focus and concentrate on what the next step is instead of rushing in without paying attention. I‚Äôm really enjoying this out very much and I think it‚Äôs doing me a lot of good thank you thank you thank you so much for this app.
5,camodogamingfan,I am enjoying the app so far- have only played once but I think over time it will help me keep my brain working better. Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in our family so I want to keep my brain healthy. Starting at my age (60) is probably a good idea as the onset for us appears to be in our 80s.
5,reddigjr,"I had recently been struggling with remembering things so I looked up puzzle games on the App Store and saw this. From the first game I played to the last I fell in love. This is the most fun I‚Äôve had with puzzles in a long time, 10/10 highly recommend for anyone looking to have fun or strengthen that brain!!"
4,Jbug10,"I like this app, a lot of stuff is great. Just wish a lot of stuff you don‚Äôt have to pay for. The app doesn‚Äôt realize that you could just buy individual apps that offer different things instead of having to pay it for it to just be in one app. I think a lot more people would keep the opposite offered more."
3,Nadjaaa123456789,"Im a high school student, and have been playing this for a while, it really gives my brain a workout! I even found myself playing this instead of just some arcade games. However, a lot of the games that it has for you to play in your free time are only available with the subscription, and the subscription is a bit pricey‚Ä¶  But overall a really good tool to enhance your brain function!"
5,Rekha601,Apart of being healthy is not just a healthy body but also a healthy brain and this app can help with that. This app is full of fun and great challenges that keep you on your toes.  After  a few weeks I feel like a can handle the mental grind and have more clarity throughout the day. I recommend it even if it‚Äôs just for fun.
1,sdan,"One of those instagram ads with a simple looking game - turns out game is not part of this app - terrible money grabbing practices due to subscription models present to restrict access to games.  Response to developer: fake advertising is not a brain development strategy - I decided to try your game and it was a switch and bait - most blatant one from the games I've tried on the app store - just change your business practices by making quality products that people would love to spend their money on - this is pathetic, sorry."
1,B. Rennard‚ô™(¬¥ŒµÔΩÄ ),Though the games are fun this app is a scam. IÔ∏è should have read the reviews before downloading. While playing the app IÔ∏è got the option to chose a ‚Äúprize‚Äù that was a discount on the yearly fee. IÔ∏è choose 92% off however after purchasing IÔ∏è quickly realized IÔ∏è got scammed. When looking in the App Store you only get 2 subscription options a 70% off and 63% off each close to $30. So IÔ∏è canceled my subscription and will definitely follow up with my bank to note them if they try to charge me again. Watch out for the tricky app!!!
5,A6572‚öΩÔ∏è,This app is the best app for fun calming games. And for building memory it‚Äôs awesome . And I‚Äôve had this app for 2 days only and I already love it . And also I‚Äôve had it for two days and haven‚Äôt came across a single problem or ad . You should download It if you want good memory and fast reaction. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,mswamom,I have really enjoyed using Impulse. I feel like it has improved both my attention and memory significantly in a relatively short amount of time. I spend less than 10 minutes a day using it and I have been using it daily for 3 months.
5,JuSi1126,I have had issues finding a way to refocus my brain before and after long study sessions. These brain training games have been an excellent source of distraction that I can count on to give me brain a break from study material while also keeping me in the zone to focus! Love it!
1,LenkaGao,I downloaded the app out of the curiosity if I‚Äôm going to like the app. I should have been able to cancel subscription within a week but in my Apple settings I‚Äôm not able to cancel it. I emailed the support per the policy - you should be able to cancel subscription by sending the email about cancellation and no answer yet. Hopefully I won‚Äôt be charged $6.99/week for app I don‚Äôt even want and I‚Äôm not even able to cancel it! Hopefully the support will reach out to me soon!
5,DesignDevineDiva,"Of all of the many exercises I‚Äôve put my brain through in my life, this is one of the most satisfying. The effects are similar to the feeling you have doing one of your favorite activities - stretching yourself to be better. Yes, I recommend this experience as improving your state of mind."
5,sometime banker,The games and tests on the app are actually quite a bit of fun. It‚Äôs like many of the free games that you can get in the App Store but with this app there‚Äôs more of a purpose behind it then selling you something or wasting your time you‚Äôre actually doing something you‚Äôre improving yourself
1,ZeeeeüéÄ,"The instagram ads are cool because they make want to take the tests BUT even with the free trial, you cannot get the results of any test unless you pay for a subscription! I knew once I was the ‚Äúin-app purchases‚Äù sign in the App Store that it would do that. Then there‚Äôs an ad where you ‚Äúwin‚Äù (I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs shown to everyone) 92% off the subscription to try to make you hurry up and buy because wow you just got 92% off‚Ä¶. nice try. Thanks for nothing! *don‚Äôt forget to end your free trial before you delete the app!*"
5,davijoma,This is exactly what I need to boost my mental prowess. I encouraged my husband to get the app as well. We set aside a few minutes each day to da our daily challenges. It takes a few short minutes but reaps great reward because I feel myself becoming more adept and more focused.
5,paijearenee,I have suffered a Tramatic brain injury from a car accident almost one year ago to today‚Äôs date. I have amnesia in which I‚Äôm taking dementia medication for. It is helping. But playing this game has made me feel like I‚Äôm in control of something in my thought process. I‚Äôm really enjoying this app.
3,Eggmuffims,I use the app to do the daily training each day which consists of 5 different games. In that timespan I am usually shown 12 ads. You get an ad before you play the game. You get an ad after you finish the game. You get an ad before you go to the next game. Ads are fine but when 70% of the time I‚Äôm on the app for the daily challenge is ads it gets kind of annoying.
5,Buckeye Grandma,I am a 66 year old female and I have some memory issues at times.  My family is concerned so I have been enjoying the impulse games that are letting me use my brain and helps me prove I am doing fine and it is not as serious as some people think.  I have scored well and will continue to use daily!
5,Eli üôÇ,I really like this app and all its tests/quizzes  And that the app works offline too! But I would really appreciate if there could be less adds when I am online because unless I get premium I have to deal with like 20 adds in one training session. Otherwise this app is awesome.
5,KIMAR96,Im relatively new to the app but so far it‚Äôs helping me feel more productive. I like the fact that your going against yourself and it tracks your progress. I can‚Äôt wait to see an improvement on my mental math. Y‚Äôall should make a version where you play with your family that‚Äôd be lots of fun.
5,clarastyle.72,"The challenges are designed to exercise different parts of the brain and consistent practice helps me think and deduct ideas faster. Interestingly enough, I noticed a byproduct of this practice. Working on these exercises ‚Äúlight a fire‚Äù in my overall state of mind so it shifting me out of a sadness, depression or any lower state to a higher, brighter mood."
5,Smartie Spice,"I got this app to help stretch my brain and improve my brain function in day to day life. Although it may seem like a bunch of kid games it actually is semi-challenging, but not in a way that makes you want to quit. I also heard keeping your brain active can prevent dementia so this app would be a good way to do that."
5,Kimbroolay,"Enjoying the app so far. Definitely gets your brain going and stimulated. I would like to see more depth on how I compare to my peers in the progress section. Not quite grasping that part, but otherwise I‚Äôm making this app a daily part of my day and enjoy it a lot."
5,Joshb2424,There are a plethora of different games to constantly keep your brain entertained. The tests section can help you better understand yourself. Look forward to completing all the levels of each game. I would definitely recommend giving this app a try.
5,Naa Tso Tso,I love this because it is a game with a purpose. I know I am struggling with memory and have two parents with Alzheimer‚Äôs issues. I wish I knew about this for them.  It‚Äôs fun educating and targeted on just what I need. Fun Functionally Targeted Memory sit ups for the brain. When and Where will the Memory Olympics begin
5,Bunniexoxox,It gives you memory with ghosts and you have to tap the numbers in the right order. When I first downloaded it I thought it would be super easy but it was a little hard and it was a lot better then I thought it was going to be!üôå
1,Kymmi68,"The three day premium trial isn‚Äôt really a full trial of premium. Every time you try to do something it offers you a huge discount on the subscription. But the catch is that instead of a three day trial and then the discounted subscription, trying to redeem the discount will start your subscription immediately and you lose the three days free to check the app out. I gave up trying to evaluate the app because of the inability to get a true free trial so I‚Äôll never know if it was worth the money."
4,quejav,"Games are stimulating but needs to be assorted  or varied, not prolonged on one game , per day.  Also if the game , player should be warned if a game is being timed or a timer should pop up, because it seems to affect my scores and it doesn‚Äôt  make sense that my score is lower than others when I just took my time playing the game."
5,Darkdogtbad,"I found this app to really help me in practical ways. It makes you focus on the game and helps with not only your memory but, problem solving, and spatial recognition. You he games force me to concentrate and as a result I feel very relaxed. It is perfect for a person like me who overthinks too much. Well done!!!!"
3,Kitasluv,"I‚Äôm so tired of seeing adds for that stupid King who needs to be saved. It‚Äôs on every game I play and honestly, after downloading it and playing it I was bored right away.  If there were different adds and maybe only at the beginning of the challenge day I wouldn‚Äôt mind. But to have to go through it 2 or three times every day I play just makes it not worth it."
4,"Good deal, okay tests","This is my second day on the app, the games are fun, but I feel as if the tests and scores are just saying the nice things about me. I‚Äôd like to think I am smart, but it feels at little patronizing. I did get a really good deal for a year subscription, and there is a lot to do on the app. Look forward to seeing more!"
5,Miko Yae,"I thought I'd try it out cause I wanted to improve my mental capacity/health and it's really fun plus the games focus on different things and actually help. For me, I get daily games for memory, problem solving, and attention. It'd help more if I was consistent but it still did sum in the week that I've used it"
5,rianleigh07,"I would be obsessed with this app if it had half the amount of ads. This app has sooooo much potential to be my favorite app. Currently, the free version is really annoying. For every game you play or quiz you try to take, you watch 1-2 minutes of ads."
5,haner naner,I downloaded this game because I saw it on tiktok I kinda knew it was going to ask for money for a trial and all that and It did. But it‚Äôs been amazing there‚Äôs still so many games open for playing and tips and information. I love it so much and it‚Äôs definitely entertaining for my adhd
4,Prometheus508,"I don‚Äôt even write these things but I was incensed just enough to do so, this is a great app I just wish it included the family share option for the amount of money you‚Äôre paying for the annual subscription. Otherwise 90% better than DOOM Scrolling (although you‚Äôd do even better outside touching grass and writing poetry in longhand)"
5,QueenJ4765,It helps me a lot and my anxiety used to be very bad and after only 2 days of doing this game. I have been able to calm down and not have those panics. Highly recommend this for people that have anxiety and for people who want to have more brain muscle like me. Definitely recommended
5,SpockJenknsTOS,"After having a ‚Äúmini stroke‚Äù due to complications from a vaccine, I have been suffering from a number of health issues, including brain fog, and uncoordinated typing. This program has been helpful in both monitoring, assessing, and training to improve my condition."
4,menssewnanne,"I wish this app was able to not have ads in the free version like Elevate does , but I understand why they do and it‚Äôs not that big of a deal just slightly annoying because I like to go go go - but definitely recommend giving this a try because there  are really fun/helpful games :)"
5,VinCenT0605,"I use this app for focus, memory, and for fun! I like setting my daily goals and I like being surprised that I‚Äôm better than I thought I was at any given game at times. This encourages me to keep playing, which in the end, is helping you achieve your goals for using the app. Have fun playing!"
5,Morgangirl6,"I love as feeling brain fog constantly, likely due to my nightly gummy intake to sleep and stress. Impulse has helped remind me that I am not stupid, just getting old and overwhelmed. I feel alive and ready to prove my intellect after I play a while. It‚Äôs very much a daily routine I need to continue and will not soon stop for anything. I needed this!"
5,Mocah1,"My former position as a manager in the aviation field required attention to detail, critical thinking, and problem solving. Now that I‚Äôm retired, I have not had to practice these skills to that degree I did before.  With this app, my brain is definitely getting a work out the more I play it‚Ä¶it is helping to keep me sharp!"
4,Meri Equestrian,"Not sure exactly how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù this stuff is for your brain but it is fun. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the amount of paywalls. I get it, the devs have to sell the premium to pay themselves, but I can‚Äôt even see the results of a test that took me 20 minutes without a micro transaction. The games are fun but the rest of the app isn‚Äôt much without the premium."
1,Yetanotherbusymommy,I downloaded the app through an ad on Instagram. I am still in the trial period but can‚Äôt seem to find it in my subscriptions order to cancel it and there is no way for me to know if I am actually subscribed or not. I tried messaging the developer but the messaging system on their website doesn‚Äôt work. I am not happy about not being able to know if I will start being charged and I can‚Äôt find a way of cancelling it. Things should be easy and clear and they are not.
5,jbfrmalafreakinbama!!!,"Basically put I‚Äôm the most impulsive person I know. This app has helped me sharpen my focus, identify distraction, remember that I too can still do basics like mathematics since I hardly ever use those skill everyday, now I can do those basic maths without pulling out my phone to use the calculator ü§£ü§£ü§£ Enjoy impulse!!! I sure do!!!ü•∞"
5,israelizzmaticizzy,"Honestly pretty fun. Lot of games that were played as a kid but with a competitive twist that challenges the mind‚Ä¶ or maybe I‚Äôve just been out of school for a while lol but no still really fun, lots to do and I‚Äôve barely started. I paid the one time subscription because I move like that. I recommend."
3,Dimitri1177,When you initially download the game it presents 3 subscription options making you think you have to pick one.   That‚Äôs a bit shady if you ask me.   Now if you didn‚Äôt fall for the subscription choices you can have an ad supported free version.   I completely understand the need for ads on a free version and am not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be.  That ad to game ratio is a bit much though.
5,Kaitsa,I was recently diagnosed with adhd and being able to understand why I did things the way it did helps me manage my impulses and reactions. This app has helped me take a break and also see how good I am with puzzles. This app helps me focus and somehow it gives me peace too
1,God O. M.,"I bought the lifetime membership a couple of months ago and had to switch Apple ID‚Äôs due to my account being compromised. When I logged in with my previous email I noticed that I didn‚Äôt have the membership anymore. When I contacted customer service to explain the situation both Apple and Impulse said that I need to purchase the lifetime membership again. So, at the end of the day, they got their money, but I didn‚Äôt get their service!!!!  No thanks for the apology! Talk is cheap!"
5,RareFury,"This app is a sophisticated tool to help our minds improve our ability to remember, to do basic daily tasks without anxiety. ""Impulse‚Äù is something everyone can benefit from, especially if you‚Äôre growing older and feeling the mental decline as most of us do."
5,Kimsuepow,it challenges my brain but yet it is doable. I don‚Äôt get discouraged because it is too hard. I definitely think it will help overtime. My memorization definitely needs improvement and ability to process things quickly with details and accuracy..
5,GoldenPants123,"There‚Äôs plenty of apps available on the net, and I have tried quite a few. However, Impulse appears to be much more sophisticated. I have only scratched the surface (as it were). I look forward to continue using this tool and improving my mental acuity."
5,autumnnapoli,"I‚Äôm still very new at using this app, so I‚Äôm not sure how great the results are, but the games are fun, well-designed, user-friendly, and engaging. I can‚Äôt wait to get to more difficult levels. And I love that they have side games and puzzles to play in between your personalized exercises everyday."
5,feivel mousekewitz,"I'm really liking Impulse so far as a nice challenge in various ways for how my neurodivergent brain works. I'm playing games that test my relatively slow processing speed, working memory, spatial processing, stress responses, etc. Super interesting and not upsetting me so far when I don't finish timed games."
5,Scott_Rich,"Definitely a productive, yet fun way to brush up on skills you typically start slacking on as the world becomes busier. Each type of game has its challenges, but it‚Äôs interesting to see where you rank among your peers. As someone who can think, but quite average, I was surprised how well I‚Äôve compared."
5,AcE-K-2/03,"What an incredible test of your mental skills. It is very accurate when it comes figuring out the type of person you are by how you make day to day decisions through the different tests and questions. I love it, and it actually drives me to want to improve my overall IQ."
5,Dustin Em,"This is really a great way to work through brain training exercises and have fun while doing so. This app provides me with many different activities that allow me to sharpen, as well as increase efficiency in my thinking and skills! Highly recommend!!"
5,Not Useful0303050507,"Great way to wake up those parts of your brain that have long forgotten how to process certain tasks, information, or problem solving. Love this App. Not to keen on having to pay for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or full access but In the world today literally nothing is free in anymore smh."
5,jacquib32,"I‚Äôm just a couple weeks into using the app a couple times a day and it‚Äôs surprisingly entertaining, challenging and rewarding. Great way to start my day and also better than social media scrolling throughout my work day lol Telling my friends and fam to get Impulse too"
5,Business Major College Student,My days are very busy and so I really enjoy the few minutes of exercises throughout the day. The exercises are fun and helpful. I feel like my brain wakes up and operates a little more efficiently. I look forward to these breaks during the day. After playing I feel mentally refreshed.
5,Cetuck,"The puzzles and brain training games are so fun and they are the same games I see commercials for.  The difference is, on Impulse the games are organized and presented in a meaningful and deliberate manner to address my individual needs!  I‚Äôve learned so much about myself already!"
1,kindaverygrumpy,"the ads in this app are OUT OF CONTROL. it‚Äôs 1 every 2 mini games or so and upon paying for them to go away (5.99 to permanently remove ads for this game) it only removes them in one mini game. not the whole app which i think is ridiculous. id gladly pay more to remove them from the whole app but to have it specifically for one game is a scam and makes me not want to play, let alone recommend the game to anyone which i was planning to do but the ads are so out of control that it‚Äôs not even worth playing"
5,—Ä–∞–∑–±–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á–∫–∏ –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∞,"Loved the lightbulb sequence game. My brain was happy to play that one. Other games are also pretty neat. Good variety. I‚Äôd purchase the lifetime for 30-40, but there‚Äôs no such a thing. Too bad. I‚Äôm not a subscription person. But it‚Äôs good. If you have money to spare and into these kinds of games, then go for it."
3,Paepaeclark,"They give you a free trial with limited access. That‚Äôs all fine and dandy. The games are fun. But they offer you quizzes that take a little time. When you complete the quizzes you can‚Äôt access your results unless you go premium or pay a flat rate for the results. I found it annoying to even offer them, if you can‚Äôt have your results, on your free trial. Other than that, I enjoyed the app."
5,Sparrow514,I love brain games and puzzle games because they are fun but especially because I am in my sixties and want to stay mentally sharp. So many great games to play and I really love that the app does not track my personal info like all other apps I have tried. Highly recommended.
5,5gamesaday,"So, the games are calming to me- my brain enjoys the fodder not attached to gem like candies. I like that most of the games are going to reinforce skills needed every day! Memory / recall puzzles of all kinds, math skills- money,  simple math. I enjoy the independence of going at my own pace, and there is no penalty here- no lost points, level, etc."
5,mon_vi,I love this app. It‚Äôs like a little sliver of fun mid day :) I especially like the impulse games and the one where you have to put all the same candies in one slot. And also the IQ test has these matching games that I really enjoyed. I wonder how accurate those results were though.. I‚Äôd like to put it on my resume. üòÜ
5,roseby_v,"Keeping in real.  This game is impressively great for the brain.  Cognitively it kept me in my toes and challenged me to realize the simple tasks can be forgotten or over looked.  Bring sharp mentally is very important and the game will keep you there  I get bored with many games after a few months of playing just because I don‚Äôt feel challenged; however, I don‚Äôt think this will be a problem playing this one.   Young or Wise all should play.  I may allow my students with Autism play. It may be the simulation they need.   This is a wonderful game. Maybe the challenge I‚Äôve been searching for."
5,Love Fish Tacos not one many,"This is by far the best I‚Äôve found. .The games are super fun ,and are those typical games that remind me of my youth ,  As you progress a simple matching game can be brutal which can leave you thinking about what needs to change In your own life ,in order to feel safe about any task you face in real life ..üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
5,samiam396,Super good for my brain and benefits me in so many ways. Love playing this game when I‚Äôm bored instead of just scrolling through hours of nonsense on social media that doesn‚Äôt benefit my brain what so ever. This app is awesome and I wish I had the money to play it more. Thanks so much for creating such an awesome app!! -samantha pate from Yosemite
5,littlest day,"This game is awesome because it allows for both mental improvement and relaxation at the same time. I‚Äôm not a math person whatsoever, but using this the past few days helps me feel like I‚Äôm learning more simply by reviewing stuff we don‚Äôt have time to review in upper levels of school. 10/10!!"
3,ikeknight,"First, the exercises and games are excellent and I enjoy doing them. What I do not like is there is always a notification. So I open the app and there‚Äôs a number on the bell, so I click it and then there‚Äôs nothing new there. I find it annoying that there are multiple notifications a day & with the exception of the reminder I set, none of the notifications are for anything."
5,Ot.hdc,I just started with this app and so far I really like the variety of brain games available. I really like the descriptions of what the different skills are and trying to beat previous scores. I want to work on focus and visual memory skills and I think this app works for those areas well!
5,Lyssafromthegoldengates,"I love the app!! I love the games, it helps me relax and enjoy the small things in life. My job is full of stress and extreme anxiety! This app helps keep my speed and agility alive! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how much you have to pay to unlock the full game!! Other than that I adore it, and appreciate the time and effort of the creators! God Bless!"
4,Adirobloxlove!!!,"So,I love this it helped me calm down when I was having trouble with life!It helped me calm down and it helped me ALOT!! Thank you for making this and also if you are bored download this!!! For the game:you should add like games not like these memorize games like fun games! But anyways I‚Äôm going to give this a 4 as a review because it‚Äôs ok but I would have games in this!"
5,üïäÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏èü§ç,I like this app because it does make you think. It makes you think outside the box with trying to figure out some of the problems. It doesn‚Äôt just give you one type of problem either. It also tests your personality. I like the riddles the best.
1,Stefanieeee,got app cuz of a dumb instagram ad for the joke of it. didn‚Äôt like the app so i deleted it and cancelled the subscription THE SAME DAY. and i know i cancelled so dont try and tell me i didn‚Äôt. now i was charged 3 days later?? FOR WHAT i don‚Äôt gave a subscription nor the app even on my phone jesus talk about money hungry. i better not be charged again next week or ever again. Requested a refund from apple :). No clue how they do it since i literally don‚Äôt have an active subscription how does it feel to take peoples hard earned money?
4,Mamabee214,It‚Äôs not just the kids who forgets certain things of mathematics and puzzles. The adults as well. Especially for those who has memory problems.   I don‚Äôt just do the brain training 7 days a week for random things.  I even try to learn the new ways of teaching for my children as well.
1,Barbieatyanna,"We‚Äôre all guilty of skipping through some minor details when we‚Äôre moving quickly on apps. Its currently April and I just noticed I‚Äôve been getting charged a $6.99 fee literally every single WEEK by this app since January (possibly earlier). I opened the app once and forgot about it.   A monthly charge seems reasonable nowadays for certain apps, but this is a weekly one. I‚Äôm genuinely confused about why...  Reminder to be vigilant with checking on Apple purchases/subscriptions."
5,impostor48,These fun games make you relax and feel happy and I really enjoy that and how i got this app was from my dad and it looked really cool and then i asked him ‚Äúhow did you get that game?‚Äù And then he showed me the game and installed it on my phone then i played it for like 2 days and now i like this so.. 5 STARS
5,goyaweezermiller,This app makes me stop during the day and use my BRAIN ‚Ä¶ since retiring from Nursing I felt like I wasn‚Äôt having to think about any task or solving any problems‚Ä¶ I think this app is a great way to start training my brain and using my memory And to keep as sharp as possible!!  Highly recommended
5,Waldoshshrjrkxo,I‚Äôve only been using it for two days but my mind feels more clear almost like their is less pressure on my mind. It‚Äôs challenging and fun. The games are more fun then most of the games I‚Äôve downloaded for fun. Let‚Äôs see if it makes any lasting changes.
5,Old-man-river,"This app really keeps you sharp. You know what they say if you don‚Äôt use it you‚Äôll lost it and that not what anyone would want. The game reminds you to play and it‚Äôs fun you never know what‚Äôs next. Like the math what comes first ( ) ,left to right,divide  or times‚Ä¶. And doing homework with the grandkids. Love it."
5,Dad & Pastor,"Unlike other apps, which claim to help your mind by playing a few minutes each day, this app has specific exercises and let you know the way in which they help different parts of the brain. So it is fun and yet truly helpful get this app."
5,uziquick,So far I‚Äôve really liked this because I feel like I‚Äôm doing something much more useful with my time then scrolling on media apps. This app has help me be better at thinking and making decisions rather than sitting and learning nothing
5,Navy grape,"I bout the app a few days ago and have been working through all the profile tests, games and daily tests and I am enjoying it more than I expected, as a veteran who has a TBI and memory issues this has helped me see where I stand and how to improve."
5,AplhaFemale,"I enjoy impulse so much, as someone who left school early and has experienced a lot of trauma, this app is helping me majorly improve my skills mentally and also leaves me feeling really positive the only two negative things I can say is it is pricey and I think it should be a seven day free trial instead of three days."
5,jayce1414,I like seeing where I rate in relationship to other players in my age range. There is a good variety of different games so I can focus on the ones I enjoy the most. I skip a few completely but of course those are the ones I really should get proficient in.
1,xxpoohhoneyxx,"I do love this app and play it every night, however, it just recently started randomly opening my web browser with a pop up virus page. Something about a ‚Äúfree gift‚Äù. I tried reporting it but unfortunately the app doesn‚Äôt allow you to report things. So I hope to get a response from this review. My app was updated 2 days ago and it currently up to date. But surely something needs to be fixed because I‚Äôve had this app for a while and it never used to do this."
4,qumquatitude,"Lots of games, not overly pushy with notifications, and useful test on ADHD, IQ, ACES and more. Unfortunately my favorite game a wordle-like word game has started glitching and giving me the same words two sometimes three times in a row. Started about a month ago. While I do often play a few rounds a night, I certainly haven‚Äôt gone through every five letter word."
3,XoXnothappyXoX,"I know that the purpose of this app is to train your brain.  However, sometimes I don‚Äôt want to do that and simply wish to play to pass time.  I don‚Äôt want to be compared and timed every time I play.  If I want to play to relax, for me, getting timed is not it.  Had it had an option to turn off ‚Äútimed‚Äù mode, I would have bought the legacy. It is unfortunate, I did enjoy the games I played."
2,Gold_mom85,"I paid for a lifetime subscription which is supposed to have no ads but when I use it, most of the time it keeps showing me all sorts of ads for games, and asking me to get a subscription. I wrote them to ask them to fix it but they haven‚Äôt done anything.  Update: they sent me a response asking me to email their support. I did and still no response to my email after several days."
5,NancyofRockhaven,"I have only been using this app for a few days, but I have to tell you, I am excited! I can see how this experience will certainly improve my thinking and brain power if I use it faithfully for the next year. It‚Äôs like I am starting a new adventure!"
4,bkayles,Don‚Äôt download the app unless willing to pay for just about everything. Ads will swamp you as well. If you‚Äôre looking for some small brain activities for 10 minutes a day then this is a good app. But don‚Äôt think you can take any of the tests and get any results. You must pay for them
4,Poslandt,"As someone who likes doing puzzles and quick brain training exercises, this app is pretty good. The puzzles aren‚Äôt an intellectual challenge, but forcing yourself to work through them quickly adds an adequate challenge. The ads are annoying, but definitely a good way to pass time and engage your mind a little bit."
5,titpix,"I love the game for myself. Anytime I forget my book at home I always pick it up for some brain games. Also, my six-year-old loves games on the phone, and I don't feel as bad turning this app over to her. It fees positive and not like brain rot. Thanks guys! Also no ads is amazing!"
5,A great game's friend,"This app is amazing, you get to choose what you wanna workout in and it also allows you to do other things! I am in love with this app and it‚Äôs only been the 2nd day! Another thing I love about it is how it‚Äôs completely free by choice, and even if I want to get premium, I was given 92% off for free!"
5,kuromi_luv,"I actually really like this game,at first I was pretty skeptical because I know pay usually comes with games like this and I don‚Äôt like paying subscriptions,but so far it‚Äôs actually really good,I still get to play games and sharpen my brain!! 10/10 would recommend"
5,NinaMS718,It‚Äôs worth to take a few moments and just play. It‚Äôs a good way to wake up the mind in the morning and relaxes and distracts the mind from a stressful day. You will walk away with a smile on your face and that‚Äôs because you found a game that provides a balance.
5,deyfwizzie630,My review is 5 stars because I find impulse a great way to use ur brain and train it with anything u struggle with (mine would be memory) sometimes my brain short circuits and forgets things so this app is helping and training my brain to not forget as much. So thank u to the creators of this app I love it sm it‚Äôs awesome!!! üòä
4,cowaroo,"This game is awesome. It helps train my brain everyday with fun and easy,medium,and harder games. So you can graduate to the higher games. A lot of things need premium but you can still play the game. Also you need premium to remove adds and have unlimited hearts. Once you run out of hears, it‚Äôs a few hours till you can play again. Over all k like this game"
5,Pella della the madella,"Truly one of the best apps I have downloaded. These skill sharpening mini games not only improve your abilities but makes it fun at the same time, got an extra 10 min to spare or need help getting your thoughts in a flow just open the app and work those  neurons. 10/10"
4,Real.Life.Barbi,"This app holds my attention because I control how quickly I can do each game. It‚Äôs really well-balanced with simple concepts and stimulating visuals, keeping you engaged. The challenges follow suit. The combination of these factors really allows you to enjoy these mini brain workouts."
5,TheBlackPearl22,"It‚Äôs great. There‚Äôs no other stuff you need to do, all the game is, is puzzles. It‚Äôs a different game every time too, so it doesn‚Äôt get boring. It‚Äôs not like one of those games that claims to strengthen your brain because most the stuff is at least a little challenging and you can see improvement."
5,Urotten,"Best new brain teaser app I‚Äôve found out. Even if u just play free versions it‚Äôs till helping improve so much like hand/eye coordination, to memory and the like‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre looking for a game to test yourself or just to improve your brain I would recommend it to anyone to just try it out."
1,alypend,"I downloaded this app because the puzzles were fun, but started getting charges at random times even though we were purchasing anything. Now even after canceling and deleting the app we are continuing to be charged. Not sure how to stop this!! Pretty sure this is not a real company.  Update: the developer response is bogus! I did not sign up for the pro plan and they have continued to charge us even after Apple canceled the subscription. This app is a scam."
5,manifestazn,"Love this app! Really makes you brainstorm an helps me to focus and solve each level. Recommend this game/app to anyone who love problem solving. Best parts is, you can apply this training in your daily life. This should be something that should be given to kids in school. My kid will be on this app daily."
5,FaithyReid,My focus and memory has honestly improved. If you can stick to it for even a week you‚Äôll notice the difference. I actually needed up getting the animal membership because I loved it so much. And all of the games are user friendly whether you‚Äôre tech savvy or not.
5,KimItzel,"It‚Äôs a great app for those who like to challenge their brain. You can choose what you would like to use this app for, for example, anxiety problems, improve in mental math or etc. The only thing that I wish was different for us free users is the amount of ads."
5,NicJE223,When there are 3 bins they are too close to the bottom of my screen so I the pause/restart/continue keeps on accidentally being hit. Please resolve.  Edit: They fixed the issue! My rating has been updated. Games are great and addictive. It‚Äôs nice to play a game that‚Äôs actually good for your brain
3,ushhxhdhgejdbidb,I saw an ad for impulse on Tik Tok and I thought why not try it out. Impulse asked me questions on what kind of performance and skill levels I was trying to raise using the app and that was amazing. After I finished the questions it brought me to a payment area but I just pressed the X. I looked at my plan and I can only have a week of training and the rest is premium so if it was free I would like it more but overall it‚Äôs a cool and fun app.
5,Krazy_kolors,It‚Äôs everything it‚Äôs advertised to be. The games serve as brain teasers to exercise your brain. The best part is that the games are mixed up and there are a lot to choose from to stop it being monotonous and it only takes a few minutes out of your day
5,Iamthestevenrojas,I enjoy this app a lot. I‚Äôm no neurologist but it‚Äôs said that the games played in this app help with brain improvement. I truly believe that it helps sharpen my brain and its functions. I kind of feel like I‚Äôve warmed my brain after utilizing it. Like when you warm up before a sports game.
5,Rawbbit,I use impulse every day before bed or early in the opening. Helps me keep my mind in check and I get motivated to move to higher levels. The selection of games is wide and I love that I am able to keep challenging myself daily. My 6 year old also plays with me and he loves it.
5,Khector78,I have only done two days of training but so far I am really enjoying it. Give it a try   Update: I love this app it‚Äôs not only challenging but interesting as well. Plus the test are enlightening and pretty accurate. This app hasn‚Äôt disappointed me and I use it everyday.
5,Tati529,"I‚Äôve been looking for a brain training app for some time now and looks like I finally found it! The short quiz allowed me to pick the areas of development I want, and the games are entertaining. I‚Äôm looking forward to completing some of their assessments to learn more about myself."
5,That Random Refrigerator,"I‚Äôve used Impulse for about a year now and it has helped me tremendously. I sleep better and longer, I feel more energized, and I feel more relaxed. The games are fun too! Personally, my favorite game is the Word Find. Overall, I feel like a better and more relaxed person. Thanks Impulse."
2,Ismarixo,"Everything you do on this app costs more and more money and it‚Äôs not advertised it would be this way. I don‚Äôt think the mini games are bad but when you ask me to buy something every time I get finished with a quiz or mini game it gets really annoying. Will continue to to do the daily mini games for free, (if I can even do that) but I will not be shelling money out for something that I could just look up."
5,bacarrie,"Impulse is great for improving speed, accuracy, knowledge, and memory. I enjoy all activities including the timed exercises as well as games with unlimited time allotted. I enjoyed the personality, IQ, ADHD, and other tests and reports to teach me about myself. It doesn‚Äôt get old and continues to challenge me every time."
5,E T.h.R.e.E,It really helps me wind down and honestly stay focused. Probably one of the best games for someone that has ADD/ADHD. By stimulating the brain enough that is has enough time to not only get enable but also establish into an environment that the brain finds its most soothing place to grow on a very well platform for fundamental growth.
5,claraB12345.,"My family has Alzheimer‚Äôs and I want to do everything I can to keep my brain healthy. These are quick and quite relaxing actually. They provide enough challenge to make you think, but you feel like you‚Äôre playing a game!"
4,TJayPoling,"I actually do really enjoy this app, but I already pay for enough things in my life, that I don‚Äôt care to add another one to that list. I‚Äôd probably play around on this app daily if it was free‚Ä¶ however it isn‚Äôt. So when my trial ends tomorrow, I‚Äôll be deleting it. Unless the developers want to work out an advertising deal with me! ;)"
5,Nickname 4 you,"With the games you can see why they give them to you, there is certain free games but not all are free, which is fine for me.  They give you new games every day, but you only get three (which is also fine for me).  It‚Äôs I really cool app, you should try it out."
2,Reignbare,Just another app trying to make a buck with poor content. I downloaded the app for the free trial within a week and they charge my card seven dollars still on the free trial. Trying to cancel subscription is impossible unless you uninstall the app. I‚Äôve reached out to Apple. Hopefully they can stop this grifter sooner rather than later. As this is a app geared towards older people this is basically praying on the elderly shame on you.
5,MrsMorton18,Helps me wake up in the morning better than my coffee does it challenges my brain just enough to activate my thoughts on the morning and also calms me down when I‚Äôm upset I‚Äôve also learned a lot about myself through the tests they provide love love love this app
5,Exerciseman,"Really good app. It can really help people‚Äôs brain no matter what disorder you have. It‚Äôs like how you‚Äôre tested in school.. I wish I downloaded way sooner, long ago and I‚Äôm 34.. This is what kids need to be doing instead of other stuff on their phones. I needed this when I was in high school at least.."
5,Michael96533,You might as well stay sharp while on your phone. There are activities that are a waste of time and tend to slow your mind down. The brain training games as least bring a small challenge and increase your attention span.
5,NONei11,"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually helping my brain to get better, but it‚Äôs not doing any harm and it‚Äôs fun. I did end up buying the one time subscription purchase because it‚Äôs just so much cheaper, and usually I don‚Äôt subscribe to anything so I guess you could say they got me hooked lol."
5,Lynster1982,"The games are clever and easy to learn. I def feel more alert and focused after playing a couple of games. I also like that it gives you a comparison score at the end just to act as a benchmark for improvements over time (e.g., performed better than X% of people your age)."
1,blackpink_lisa,"I completed a day worth of tasks and it have a me a prize that was a 92% or 98% discount off premium plan. It said it would be $0.58/week so I went ahead and bought it. I realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to be using the app much so I decided to cancel my subscription and saw that it charged me for the whole year. I feel scammed after it told me that it would be less than a dollar per week and instead of getting charged weekly, they charged me for the whole year which was almost $30"
5,1122boyer,I‚Äôm hoping this helps with my reconnecting my brain function.    I‚Äôve heard great things about this type of Neuro feedback and am hopeful this helps with the issues I still struggle with.  So far I‚Äôm enjoying this app.  It‚Äôs only been 2 days.  But I think I‚Äôll like it going forward
5,Wspanicgirl,"Love the challenges and the pace off these games! It is a much better use of my time that would otherwise be wasted getting sidetracked going down a scrolling rabbit hole of internet brain numbing nonsense. Thanks for encouraging good screen-time with fun games do t bombard me with pop ups, and spam!"
5,*Linsay*,I really like this app because it only takes a couple minutes a day and the games are fun. They make you think which is the point but I feel the benefits are quicker with this app compared to others I have played.
5,yuliya.k21,"Mental health is becoming a fundamental thing nowadays. Struggling with anxiety and daily multitasking routine increases the level of depression and deprives our productivity. So mental self care and its training are our life saviors. I believe, ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù is a beautiful solution to meet my goal to stay sharp and wise! Highly recommend it!"
5,Hxylxx99,"Since I started playing these brain games, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve had a little longer attention span, little better memory, and it‚Äôs something I can do to distract my mind if I wanted to escape in any way. If you want to have fun and learn something from it, I highly suggest this app."
5,Vilhaknss,"To be honest I downloaded it out of curiosity. As I started to play it was actually fun. This game is probably a good addition to your phone for times of waiting, boredom or even just to work your brain. Something different from just a ‚Äúmindless‚Äù game."
5,MarikeSwart,"A better way to entertain your brain versus mindless scrolling through social media feeds. Sometimes you just need to shut off a bit, or focus on something outside of the ordinary day to day responsibilities. It relaxes me, and is beneficial for brain training at the same time."
5,merrick98,Doing these small little exercises has already improved my memory and thought process within the course of a week. The games are fun and don‚Äôt take up a ton of time - definitely going to continue exercising my brain with Impluse!
5,changemynumber,"I loved ALLL the games I played. Some were very challenging and some were very light on the mind. It was so relaxing and time consuming. It actually makes me feel like I‚Äôm working my cognitive skills, reading skills, and basic math! I really wish I could of continued using the app. Really a shame that it‚Äôs a weekly subscription."
5,C.T.L.199604,I‚Äôve only had the app less than a day and I‚Äôve done so much. It‚Äôs nice to know kinda where you‚Äôre at and to see results that you believe match up- it‚Äôs validating. If you wanna test yourself and sharpen your skills then get this app! I got my sister and brother in law hooked too üòÇ
3,SibelleGh,"Most apps mentions to the consumer that there will be a free trial for certain days before they download the app. But this is not the case. It was surprising to be locked out after day 3! Also, other similar apps allows limited daily workouts for those who don‚Äôt wish to go premium. They would still have access to several games daily but not the privilege to access all games.. The quality and diversity of games is great!"
5,Renay4567,"Look forward to training everyday and enjoying the games! Especially the relax games before going to bed, helps shut my mind off and enables me to actually fall asleep faster. Started 2 months ago, haven‚Äôt missed a day as I don‚Äôt want to break my streak!!!"
2,bojibabygirl,"I LOVE this app! And used it faithfully every day‚Ä¶multiple times a day. However when I had to do a n iPhone restart, I found that although it shows a profile, it does not actually save your progress. In other words, it isn‚Äôt let you actually set up a profile with your name, email, etc. You don‚Äôt have the option of signing in or out. So if the app is deleted, you start back at the beginning.  Bummer."
5,Juanky179513,"This game is so much fun. It helps me get that jumpstart in the brain to start it all off with good concentration and focus. It tells me things i want to know about myself like for example my IQ level, my type of thinking if im more right than left and more. I highly recommend it."
1,Alma San,"Just another money hungry app. I did the free trial, after 3 days I‚Äôll be charged if not canceled and they want me to sign up for another weekly payment to get my results.. So first use of the app there‚Äôs TWO different paywalls. The business and your app will probably fail. I don‚Äôt know who would be okay paying for this app. You can‚Äôt advertise something and then force people to pay two times to do what you advertised would be possible.  I knew it‚Äôd be a scam like this when I saw the advertisement."
5,"jjiio,makoakwjejdidjfhf","I never imagined that this type of program could work for me. However, after a couple of weeks I really noticed a change In my cognition and memory for the better! I‚Äôm having to rely less and less on Siri!!"
5,Koala woman üë©üèª,"I am smarter already, and I have only use it for three days. it is fun in entertaining for kids, but it is still challenging for adults. no matter if you were a kid trying to get smarter or an adult just wanting to train your brain. I recommend this game for anyone."
5,djfvfjfo,üíØThis game is so fun and can help improve mental math and attention. I am a n 7th grade and downloaded this fun game that really helps for learning mental math and helps you get improve over time. If you are looking for improvements you n Math u should definitely download this! üëçüíó Thank you!!!
5,backsideof40,I love this app! It a great way to exercise your grey matter improve functions. It never feels like work and I love the stats u get so you can see how much you improve and compare to others. At first I thought it was a little pricey but it‚Äôs definitely worth it.
2,pamu72,"Cool games, but some are not able to be completed without the ‚Äòextra tools‚Äô so you must watch an advertisement to get the extra tool to complete the level. There are already huge ads between games (30-60s), this was just an extra one (60-75s). I‚Äôm actually going to delete this app because of that. You spend more time watching ads then playing the games‚Ä¶ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,BlackPeaceMaker,I appreciate that the games are quick and easy and the app regularly reminds you throughout the day to take a break and work out your brain for just a bit. If you are someone like me who gets overstimulated or bogged down with work in life this is a fun reliever for your mind.
5,Albyz88,"This app is really cool. It was an impulse purchase haha. But I love that it has various brain tests, along with a multitude of brain games! I've purchased something like this before but it felt more like a chore than fun. This is comprised of really short and fun games, all very different, that keep it really interesting!"
5,Al's diner,Excellent app. Just wanted to give it a few days of use before I gave a more extensive review. I chose this app because my sister said I have memory issues (I know this is because of day to day stress). This app is helping me train my attention to things a little more carefully.
5,this isn't yours to change,"If you‚Äôre looking at your phone screen each day, you might as well improve your brain function. Just a few minutes a day with fun, engaging games is all it takes. I‚Äôm enjoying myself immensely."
5,Shockakahn,I always feel like my brain is sharper after practicing with impulse. My responses are quicker and I find my brain retrieving info quicker. It's a valuable tool for those who have to make a lot of quick decisions at work or who need to gather their thoughts for insightful discussions and presentations.
5,CortovaNova,"Right now it seems like childsplay, but I can wait to progress into the more advanced levels. As soon as I get paid next week, I plan on purchasing the ‚Äúone time, lifetime plan purchase option which is a ridiculously good deal!"
5,LyLy Ward,I suffer from a lot of different mental Illness‚Äô and this has helped me think quicker and prioritize what‚Äôs important and not in what I think. It keeps my brain thinking and testing myself to improve. It‚Äôs extremely relaxing and helps a lot mentally in a healthy way. It boosts my self esteem too lol.
5,James970,The impulse brain training app is a great way to improve my working memory and exercise my mind. It‚Äôs fun and easy and the benefits are very good. I have some experience with brain fogs and mental adversity and this is a good app to help when I get distracted by a large task at work or just need a break from overthinking.
5,cassidy bolster,Honestly at this point in the game I‚Äôve been playing for about a week yes there are quite a few adds but overall I love all the games it has and the tests it is so fun for me and with my bad memory I like to play those ones and I love math so I‚Äôm lucky they have math things also.
5,lotus de loca,"Been using it a month and I feel like I have less memory episodes where I forget people , words and sentences as I speak them some days are worse than others. I am getting quicker and farther on each game each day"
5,KayanaBloodrayne,I believe that it‚Äôs important to distance yourself from traditional games that do nothing to stimulate your mind  and this creates interesting and engaging mind games that really makes you think in a good way rather than the normal societal pressure and stressful thoughts.
5,Jackiefroberg65,"Loving the a lot test and quiz‚Äôs to keep my mind a little better on the focus I‚Äôm not usually on this kind of apps but I think I‚Äôm definitely paying the $27 for the whole yr to get the progress reports and other stuff u let‚Äôs u know the process of quiz‚Äôs the games , math a bunch of different stuff"
5,Kellie_Baumgartner,This app is so much fun. I downloaded it for one game and I had no idea all the cool challenges it actually had. My favorite part is the random games it gives you but also the fact it ranks you against others to let you know where you stand. Want a challenge get this app!
5,Skirken,"It has a wide variety of test/puzzles. It‚Äôs not too expensive. And has daily exercise plan. I really feel like it will be helpful in improving/exercising my cognitive functioning. If you want to improve your cognitive functioning in a fun, helpful way, this is the tool for you."
5,Pescador3347,"I‚Äôve tried several ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù and as a 57 year old that would like to keep my brain sharp, this has been the best app I‚Äôve found, to date.  Instead of the same old repetitive game, playing over and over, this game takes you through different stages, focusing on several different factions of the brain that decrease with age.  It‚Äôs far more entertaining and effective than just doing the daily newspaper crossword or ‚Äúlogic puzzles‚Äù.  If you are starting to ‚Äúage‚Äù or just want to keep your brain sharp, I‚Äôd highly recommend downloading this app and putting it to use!"
3,LandonCoding Robotics!,"I got this app not only to be sharpen my brain, but also to relax and help me wind down a bit. But these ads cause so much stress. After every single level I always have this feeling that an ad will pop up and it‚Äôs the suspension that stresses me out a bit. Great app, but you‚Äôve got enough money. At this point you‚Äôre just milking it. Slow down with the ads please."
5,Qcooltiger,It‚Äôs entertaining and it is also educational. I feel more confinement at school and smarter. It‚Äôs great brain work out. I would suggest anyone get it since you can use it for free. But it‚Äôs even better if you pay the subscription. So don‚Äôt hesitate get it now.
5,Tray09198,I usually have a difficult time starting a routine when it comes to stuff like this but I have found that this is a simple and effective app when it comes to reminders and focusing me on my goals for the day.
5,BeccaBradley1984,"I have an attention span of a goldfish and have always struggled with logical thinking (maths was a huge issue for me both at school and as an adult). This app is amazing! It‚Äôs helped me learn to concentrate and focus without getting distracted and my logic, problem solving and maths is really coming along well with the help of this app."
5,stephbmann,With my mom suffering from dementia and seeing that disease first hand I am always playing games and trying to do things that they have found to help the brain exercise. I appreciate this technology and have enjoyed playing and hopefully strengthens my cognitive parts of my brain.
5,ZeeCov,"This is a great app that has really helped me with my cognitive functions. I have one question though, I have completed all 188 puzzles and wanted to know if there was a way to either unlock more or reset them so that I could go through them again?"
5,harrisonsma,"Feels so good to be working these challenging games, stimulating my brain instead of just mindlessly scrolling! As a nursing mom who has to sit for long periods of time this just FEELS so good!! I feel sharper, refreshed, and relaxed after playing!! Love love love! Do yourself a favor & get on it! Sending to all my family & friends"
5,Gj√ºdith,"I like the games in the app. It‚Äôs simple and quick to use , especially when you only have a few minutes to distract yourself from something . Helps me refocus . Games are simple, yet engaging . It sometimes wants me to continue playing more."
5,CathiGg,I really like the variety of training Impulse has to offer. It doesn‚Äôt get boring like other apps I have tried. I also like the detailed feedback it gives. It really helps me to better track my deficits and areas of improvement.
5,aacclx,"I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing these games in my free time, better than scrolling social media aimlessly. But doesn‚Äôt take too much time to complete the tasks. Feels like little achievements that just boost your mood and exercise your brain :)"
3,devilish raisin,I really like the games and I think they do really improve like the brain but the only thing are the ads and the massive pay walls because it‚Äôs like really expensive and like I understand but also they have like it it‚Äôs way too expensive and it‚Äôs not very accessible so inspect expensive for a subscription but I I‚Äôm really glad that there are still free things
5,Mellojk,I really like the games a lot. It‚Äôs really a good challenge for I‚Äôm 50 years old and I wanna stay sharp and I like the times tables the patterns and all of them really. My only complaint would be some of the directions are hard to understand  but two thumbs up
5,GABBI BLM,Im about 5 minutes in and i love it i like that it tells you how personal your experience is and where you fall amongst other peers to know where you need to improve even if you are super above average meaning you can improve in other aspects to learn to be more relatable
5,Startanaa,"I have frequent panic attacks and severe anxiety, I got this app and was a little ashamed that when it comes to health and benefit we always have to pay for something, like a subscription. But overall all the free things are helpful. Also very calming and distracting when feeling symptoms of panic."
3,DragonCityLover1,"I played the games and they seem fun but it seems like such a money grab. You cant do the tests and see a result without having to pay 5$ or the whole subscription, I might just be a cheapskate but I'm not paying at all, even if it is 28$ a year. Like I said the games are fun and challenging but the fact that you cant see the test results without paying is a little infuriating."
5,me892630-,"I struggle with focusing on text over a light background, and it would be really nice and convenient to have an option for a black background and white text, and maybe a customizable option featured in the subscription."
5,mrmcdoned,"Impulse is really helpful for things like paying attention. Paying attention is something i don't necessarily struggle with often but impulse helped me improve. Main reasons i love impulse is: the games are fun, it helps improve needed skills, the ads aren‚Äôt terrible  I would recommend!!"
5,TwistedTrashPunk,"I was pretty skeptical if this training would be worth the cost or time, but I‚Äôm seeing results rather quickly. I cannot always make the same time for it each day, though the reminders seem helpful."
5,HylianNineTails,"Im glad I found this app! It has fun brain games and there seems to be always something new instead of the same game. Unlike other apps, due to repetition, I get bored and tired of them and usually Uninstall. This app also calms me down when I‚Äôm on my little ADHD spiral."
5,Jsjajan182847,"I enjoy the various games, puzzles, and tests that engage the brain and eyes. Focus, Memory, and quick & creative thinking are challenged. I enjoy this more than other mindless games when I have a few minutes. A couple of these in the morning with coffee to get the brain out of bed."
5,dako1015,"Way better than I thought it was going to be. I‚Äôm really impressed with the variety of test,puzzles,games, and etc. I just got the 6.99 week to try it out and starting to think its definitely worth the annual subscription!!!"
5,sundarmd2000,"You won‚Äôt be disappointed! That‚Äôs for sure.  Excellent triaging of a customized goal set for you whether it pertain to fine calculations, simple to complex problem solving, and even hand eye coordination in relation to puzzle solving while looking at time management. ‚Äònuff said!!!"
5,kimberlyselden,I have several other of the brain learning apps and they‚Äôre all very similar. Impulses platform is a completely different experience. I am having a lot of fun doing the different tests and practicing every day! Thank you for coming up with something differentüòä
5,LaneTheSalesGuy,After leaving school I don‚Äôt feel my mind is challenged a lot in various ways with most days being repetitive and tedious work. This allows me to keep my brain sharp and try to improve my reaction time as well as my reasonable thinking skills.
5,hazelorosco,This game is so awesome because If you are colorblind (I am not colorblind) it gives you the option to make the screen like you need it. It also is Really intertaining because you don‚Äôt need wifi and you don‚Äôt have to wasn‚Äôt the next day to play games.
5,leahwthemooniconpic,"This app‚Äôs games are faster than other ‚Äúbrain workout‚Äù apps I have tried, but no less helpful in getting my mind going for the day!  I especially like the one line drawings, I could do those for hours lol!  Definitely worth checking out!"
5,M.Aliondabeat,This gaming Brian exercising app Exceedingly  Helps with memory focus and testing iq and level ofProblem solving systematic equations Just like hooked on phonics factuality president and solidification factually factuality factual factual information ‚Ñπ and factual facts solidifications president shakur facts solidifications facts and factual factual information center information facts facts solidifications president shakur facts solidifications facts and factual factual information ‚ÑπÔ∏è
5,JustDupes,"I was concerned that my memory was declining so I did some research on ways to help. One of those is brain games for focus, clarity, quick decision making and critical thinking. I no longer feel foggy brain or embarrassed that I can‚Äôt find the words to say when I need them. Very useful app!"
5,CravenTaken,"Honestly playing these game brought a self awareness of when I‚Äôm able to do my best and when I freeze up or pause during an exercise, overall it‚Äôs fun and I hope I‚Äôm able to build my self and not burst through everything thinking I don‚Äôt need it. üò£üòñü§≠ü§´"
5,DylanBuys,I love the app it‚Äôs been very entertaining and beneficial for me over the past few weeks. My problem with it is there is no way for me to transfer my progress to my iPad. Nor is there a version made for the iPad. I would love if these two issues were fixed!
5,Brittney831,Unfortunately I have to cancel. I play so much hated having to pay $30 for a subscription. Soooo worth it. After the year it‚Äôs charging $7 a week. Can‚Äôt figure out how to change my subscription. So I‚Äôm having to cancel it. The games and tests are amazing. This app is amazing.
5,original-bettyknows,Impulse has been a pleasant experience. It‚Äôs not intrusive on your phone with notification overload. The games are interesting and results descriptive. There‚Äôs also a Mental Journal portion of the app that I‚Äôve been exploring. It‚Äôs a series of tests to test your IQ. This is a fun daily app and esthetically pleasing and user friendly.
5,tttvtefcf vrhg,"Impulse is a great app. I never thought it was so good but then I figured out how fun it was after just my first three games, after that I got 92% of of my subscription and it made me really want to keep playing, if you keep playing you will improve your memory, yput mental math, etc‚Ä¶."
3,TheLotusMind,"One of the games I play very often is the ‚ÄúWords crossword‚Äù. Occasionally I‚Äôm stuck and I want to see the solution. To my surprise, I have to watch a video ad of some games which I cannot even close. I actually have to close the Impulse app and reopen it‚Ä¶ Besides this annoying bug, it‚Äôs unacceptable to having to watch ads for a game that I already pay for!"
5,carls junior 1543,"This game is so fun, and at first I was like,‚ÄùOk, well, I‚Äôve tried these games in the past, and haven‚Äôt had the best experience with them‚Äù but this game is actually pretty fun. The one line game could have some better quality, but this was actually really fun for me. I recommend it."
3,Djsizjo,The idea of this app is great but there can be some tweaks first off I wanted to take an IQ test and it took me a while and when I finished it didn‚Äôt let me see my results unless I got premium so they basically wasted 15 minutes of my time and if you don‚Äôt have premium you can‚Äôt rly play like any of the games accept for like a few out of like a hundred üòï
4,EraserheadBaby,"I think it‚Äôs very cool that you get a daily exercise based off of your goals, and an explanation on how each game/puzzle trains your brain. I don‚Äôt have a paid membership but I‚Äôm still satisfied with the free services this app provides. It‚Äôs got a decent amount of free games, puzzles, and tests including IQ tests and an ADHD test."
5,hello ur bad guy,"The app is great, but I feel as if there are too many ads, it is making my enjoyment with the app subpar, but if there was a way to reduce the amount of ads that pop up it would be great."
5,KGardin,"The games are simple and fun, but also harder than expected.  It‚Äôs nice to see the score improvements from session to session.  I have a decline in my score when I don‚Äôt use the app for a while (months); that is a good reminder for me to do it daily."
1,Pdubble12,I used to love this app. But you took away the days played and that was a point of pride for me. Also changed the number of games required to play each day. I‚Äôm very sad. I do not like new version at all. I won‚Äôt be using as often any longer. Anyway to go back? Apparently this was changed to become a money maker now with ads and premium. I am uninstalling this as the changes ruined this app for me that I played consistent for the past year plus.
5,Lady shiv,"I have only been using for a few days, but am enjoying the app and exercises. It is nice that they start at a low level and work up to the higher levels.  Will continue to use and see how much it helps."
4,NYAH_luvsimpulse,This app is Great I saw it in a TikTok add.  The app helps you understand more about yourself. When I downloaded this game I took the ADHD test and they gave me my results back and they were very much true. This app is great for people with anxiety or have mental disabilities because it helps them understand who they are and that they are for sure smart. 5 stars‚≠êÔ∏èüåü
5,Blessed Child of God#2,"I first found out about the app from my sister. Dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in our family line on all sides, so she decided to start to reverse as much as she could. I played her app and loved it, so I downloaded it and loved it ever since. The app makes me think and helps my cognitive growth."
5,nevermindmy name,I love being able to play a game for relaxing or stress relief and knowing that at the same time my brain is being strengthened against deterioration . I‚Äôve often felt like games were a waste of time but with this app that is just Not the case!! Thank you for creating this!!
2,DaniWlkr,"I downloaded the app because I thought it looked interesting. The first couple of games were alright. I thought it would be a good brain exercise. It was. But I felt it was a little ‚Äútoo‚Äù redundant. I canceled my subscription on the third day. Two days later, I was charged $6.99. After going round and round with Apple support, I decided to just pay it and cancel again. The game was so-so, but definitely not worth what they charge for it."
2,H4X1NY0UR$Y$73M,"It's an interesting idea for an app. But at the end of the day it's just a cash grab, capitalizing on the people who need more reassurance in their life. Psychology is a very broad spectrum, and 72 questions and answers ran through an algorithm simply isn't enough to give you a detailed understanding of how your brain and emotions work. Maybe a very slight understanding. But all in all, this app is about as useful as those Facebook quizzes that tell you what superhero you'd be."
5,cocobeens1234,"It‚Äôs a super fun game I have found myself choosing this game immediately when I pickup my phone. I also love how you can choose what parts of the brain you want to work on, your daily goal of play time,your approximate age,etc‚Ä¶ to get the perfect brain training fit for you."
5,Mbjacobo,"I had a baby recently and realized that after pregnancy my memory and ability to focus were diminished. This is perfect, the exercises work and they‚Äôve short enough that I can do them even when the baby is awake"
5,suxhahsuxj,I really like the app for one it can help with remembering stuff like in math and that‚Äôs one of ny hardest subjects but in general I really like this app because to me it is peaceful and really calming for me it also helps my mind to feel good throughout the day I‚Äôve had this app for three days and it really is enjoyable
5,G_lucid,This app is amazing so far and im really enjoying the daily workouts for my brain. It really feels like im increasing the efficiency of my mind in various ways. Its like putting your brain through a yoga class. Slowly building strength and balance over time as well as increasing your understanding of its functions.
1,mmu193,"Came up as an ad on another app, and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. CANNOT EVEN TRY OUT THE TESTS WITHOUT AGREEING TO PAY FOR MEMBERSHIP. To make it worse, when I found out there was no way to access the results without paying, and I tried to exit, they proceeded to bombard me with ‚Äúare you sure‚Äù messages, attempting to get me to access the results of the one test for a ‚ÄúOne time fee of 4.99‚Äù  How cheap can you be? I was hoping this app would help me with my mental health, but it has only made me more frustrated. This is terrible."
5,Volleyball lover14,"I really like being able to go through the processes in my head without a clock ticking. For me personally, this is much more satisfying and I find myself really thinking things through instead of just tapping a random answer to beat the clock."
5,cftxtxotccy,It‚Äôs really great little Overpriced I‚Äôd say but worth it with as much as it gives as long as you buy the onetime charge which it‚Äôs ridiculous the price but you can do the 3 day trial try everything out and you decide if it‚Äôs worth it for you or your kid or not
2,Vandaling,This game is riddled with ads. You can‚Äôt play two levels without an ad. When you take the tests it makes you decline purchasing it like 3 times and if you click the notification portion to get rid of the notification you‚Äôre right back at the results to have to decline buying the report again 3 times. It has potential but doesn‚Äôt take into account adhd brains and doesn‚Äôt seem to have a timeframe for a game to end.
1,Glorya12,"I downloaded this cause I had previously saw an advertisement in a game I played. I‚Äôve seen other reviews on this specific app, however I downloaded it for probably 10 minutes played the games and all that the ads kept popping up and it was really annoying anyways. I‚Äôve never seen an app slow my phone down and glitch so bad it lagged and wouldn‚Äôt let me open other apps. I ended up deleting it and a few minutes after it reinstalled and messed my phone up"
5,ughhello728927849208488392,i personally have a brain condition were my brain processes things differently than the average person  it has affected my life inside school math is a daily struggle and being able to focus on one thing at one time is equal to a heart attack for me i have seen real results with Impulsive and its low-key really fun
5,Homegirlmarz,"I absolutely love the challenge of the games and better yet, the look of the app is very nice and sophisticated. Every day there are different games and makes it much more exciting. After completing your daily dose of games you still have the option to play more if you wished to. Definitely recommend."
5,Casey4000,Compared to other apps I like this one the most so far. It‚Äôs got other things that ones like lumosity do not and I find them more enjoyable. Maybe it‚Äôs the graphics looking more like kids games but they‚Äôre more fun for me to play
4,spellflinger,I never give reviews but I‚Äôve been playing this daily and it actually helps so I decided to get the subscription and so far haven‚Äôt been disappointed but be warned they will try to over charge at first but if you ignore the first offer the game gives another for 92% off
5,Ashkracker,"I love playing games and since having children, I feel like my brain and I are disconnected. I love this app. I enjoy the quizzes, because they‚Äôre subjects I‚Äôve been curious about, and I enjoy playing the games (as stated above). I‚Äôm so happy I caught the sale which has allowed me to purchase for life!"
5,Emmeline_axolotl,"Ok so I heart Impulse so so so so much. If you're forgetful or want to get better at other stuff, like me... Impulse is the game for you! I personally love it so much! There aren't to many adds, there are daily practice games already chosen for you... Anyway, I love Impulse! It is so fun totally recommend it! Thank you for reading this! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°  TTYL!!"
5,ShlickVic6,"I‚Äôve only been using the app for two days so I am not going to say that it is working on me already, but it is fun. I‚Äôve enjoyed the exercises and I do see how it will help down the road. I‚Äôm excited to see all the different improvements in me."
5,Suzkigs,Whenever I play impulse I feel my brain gets a good workout and I am sharper for giving myself the mental exercise. I need metal  exercises because I have  several brainsurgeries and at times felt that I needed to sharpen up my skills. This is one app that has helped a great deal.
5,mefh04,"I really like this game ü§≠ Idk if it‚Äôs actually helping my memory or not because the levels seem to be too easy for me, but it‚Äôs still fun and it doesn‚Äôt feel like one of those games with no concept or any type of purpose beside to just rot your brain."
5,Trying-To-Adult,"I usually don‚Äôt download apps like this, because it costs money, but this is an absolutely amazing app! It helps you get to know yourself a little better, and also helps with mental exercises to keep your brain, sharp and plastic!"
4,Henneball,Have not explored everything. Some times my phone didn‚Äôt register click so I ended up performing not well on some tasks/questions. The ones that worked seamlessly are great. Still a little curious on how some scores are low though it was done at pretty quick speed with 100% accuracy.
5,Crazygamer 123,Fun and exciting game. It keeps you interested every step. There‚Äôs a challenge if you accept. I like the accuracy. I like how much it is catered towards you and what your needs are. Some levels I don‚Äôt like because they‚Äôre too challenging for me. But that‚Äôs the point lol.
5,Precious564,"I was skeptical but paid. I‚Äôm 59 and can feel my concentration, short term memory and anxiety taking over. I decided I‚Äôm not going to let it happen. I feel young, I‚Äôm getting my body in shape and now my brain. It‚Äôs fun and challenging and I‚Äôm seriously competitive against my peers. Try it! It‚Äôs awesome!"
5,Pjstewart,"I am an artist so I spend so much time trying to creat problems for me to visually solve. I am also part of an Alzheimer‚Äôs Study. I find that interesting also. As I get older my memory is not as sharp as it use to be, so I feel that brain exercises should be helpful."
5,Shwacky1,"After suffering brain damage in the hospital, I really didn‚Äôt realize how much was gone until a good year and a half went by. I like these little games- they are fun and yet not overpowering. I am looking forward to my improvement!"
5,brittany0_0ann,I downloaded this cause I wanted some puzzle games and this app is also built to keep your brain active so it was a win win. The puzzles and tests aren‚Äôt hard at all but they are still enjoyable and I feel like I‚Äôm doing something good for my brain. :)
5,Katie063,"I like the way that it is sort of personalized to me and what I want to improve I don‚Äôt have the pro, but wish I could. But if you can‚Äôt afford than the regular is wonderful too. If you want something even better, which is optional, you should!!!"
4,msles23,"Since playing impulse, I‚Äôve noticed my improvement for attention to detail. from day-to-day tasks to product management. So far I‚Äôve only been playing just for five minutes a day to relieve some stress, but thinking about changing it to help sharpen certain skills. It‚Äôs been pretty good so far!"
5,ben4saken,"I have tried other brain training programs but this is the best by far!  I love anything that makes me think and keeps my brain active. Many, many games to choose from and the lifetime option is wonderful. Others only do annually. This is a great app!"
5,Tiffynshermie,"It has been an amazing stress reliever. I also can tell that for the past two days after a few minutes my brain starts to ‚Äúkick in.‚Äù Coming from a cancer patient and someone who has ptsd, I highly recommend this app so far."
4,ronniez26,"I would have given this 5 stars, but I‚Äôm not yet capable of that since it‚Äôs only my second day with the app. The games are fun and the higher levels can be somewhat challenging. The IQ test really put me to the test, but I did pretty well on it. All around solid app."
5,PheonixPlayer,"Impulse has helped me too relax and unwind while still keeping me on my toes, the only thing I don‚Äôt appreciate is how much you have to pay if you want to get the full experience. I really wish you could just see your test scores. Other than that Impulse is AMAZING."
4,Indecisive_individual,"This app has very fun logic puzzles and mind twister games, and it's a good mix of everything, and To add to that these are actually fun & intriguing games. Although to get full access you do have to buy a subscription. I would love to see the full capabilities of this app, but I do not have the money. Have fun Gaming!"
5,roarrrrrrrrrrrrü¶ñ,This game is literally so amazing I am learning so much from this game even though I‚Äôm not too far and I‚Äôm learning so so so so so so much and I‚Äôm really happy that they got this game out like you know made this game and it can really be helpful for certain people if you try out the game BYE!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Excited Participant,"I like that the games are simple, quick, and actually fun. If I make a mistake it forces me to think twice which has been amazing for my attention span. I‚Äôm always in the go so whenever I have a moment I can pull this up  and the game is ready to go. Enjoy!"
5,Paisley tie,The games are really great! Fun! Entertaining! You think‚Ä¶.how easy is this going to be‚Ä¶..guess what‚Ä¶.?? Lol it‚Äôs not so easy but not impossible and I cannot wait to replay against my last score! I cannot say enough good about this app‚Ä¶.Try it out and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
5,ddavis2319,Very impressed with the huge variety in different quizzes to test your brain. The app is addicting though. I have began to look forward to new challenges everyday & love the fact it shows you where you rank among others. A++
4,lucy-fire,"Hello, I am one of the players who range from ages 13-17. I like most puzzles so this app is really cool for me. It forces me to critically think as well as use my common sense, something I feel like is no longer common. It‚Äôs a really cool app, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I‚Äôm hoping for something free from the app. My only issue is payment, but I understand why they do it."
5,happy420life,I like to use this app daily to keep my brain fully functioning in the crazy work environment in life that I deal with on a daily basis it helps my memory and helps me quickly find a solution to small problems that I have ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶great app worth the download
5,nikimomae22,I use this app when I feel sluggish. I notice in the morning I‚Äôm slower with the exercises than in the afternoon and evening. It helps my mind get the morning fog and boost I need. It helps clear my head if I am having headaches it truly is an amazing exercise app for your mind. I 100% recommend.
5,Mamajuju823,I never play games and never have apps I have a lot of OCD so I just can‚Äôt have anything I don‚Äôt need or use but I decided to take a chance on this game and I love it I can‚Äôt live without it now I think I‚Äôm gonna be playing games all day I‚Äôve only had it for four minutes. But I‚Äôm in love!!!!
2,judypr092,I am enjoying these games but have contacted customer service three times by email and there has been absolutely no response. Not to mention that it was difficult to track down the email address‚Äî I had to find it here in reviews. As such I would not recommend this app. There are plenty that are similar but that also have responsive customer service.
5,KJ_6002,"I have been struggling with my memory for the last couple years so I decided to try this app out, just by using it for a couple of days I feel myself getting better with remembering. Great app 10/10 recommend it to anyone struggling to remember. ü§ôüèΩ"
5,moretaffa,I know I don‚Äôt remember enjoying school but this is fun. Feel like I could just do this all day. Being that my family has a history of mental illness I think I just might thanks for making it fun!!! Personally I think everyone should use this app big and small‚Ä¶
5,Galaxii76,"I love the challenges that this puts my brain through, didn‚Äôt think my mind could think such a way. I feels great knowing that I still have the ability to strengthen some of my weaknesses. I‚Äôm happy that I am gaining more knowledge and strength."
1,TGill3,"At first glance this app appears to be something of interest. Unfortunately following the download the user is faced with several prompts requesting that you sign up for upgrades for rather expensive fees.  This happen before you are able to even test out the product.    At one point it states that you can have a free trial, but will automatically be billed shortly there after.    I was not even able to explore what this app had to offer before I felt compelled to erase it from my phone, for fear that my account will be charged for something I DO NOT.   There is no way to cancel and I‚Äôm still unsure if my account is going to be billed.    There are several layers of deception.  I strongly advise all users to pay close attention during the download process.  As for my close friends, I will strongly advise them to avoid this app completely."
5,Best for traveling!,"I have Lumosity as well, and tbh I enjoy these games so much more. They are challenging and the graphics are bright and fun to engage with. The personality tests are great and provide detailed recommendations on improving those areas of inadequacies, like a grown up report card. üòÄ I am highly satisfied with this purchase."
5,CDamianos,As a young person experiencing memory issues I have been using impulse to help me gain back some of what I have lost and I can say it has been nothing short of amazing plus it never really feels like I‚Äôm brain training I‚Äôm just playing games and having fun
5,Clb Joyce,I just found this app and is in love already! It reminds me of when I first went through retraining the brain. This app kept my busy and really soothes my brain. It helps me concentrate and leave the outside noise alone even if it happens.
5,Jeremiah22oo,"Compared to other brain activity games I have played ; as a type one brittle diabetic who survived a month long coma, I find this to be accurate, quick , to the point and scientific . I have visual memory loss ; this is wonderful in helping that issue . So far."
5,delaubadere,"Loving the app so far. The ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù deal was quite a catch since only $10 more than the yearly subscription, the downside being you don‚Äôt get to test it first (since you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a one-time deal). Lots of games, levels, and tests. Loving it so far!"
4,ravila1023,"Downloaded a few brain training apps to try them out and this one seems to fit the mold for me. The app runs a special eventually for a year so I signed up. Tasks seem simple enough and increase in difficulty, has multiple tests to determine things like IQ and if you suffer from ADHD."
5,hnybny325,I have been enjoying getting myself to pay attention and to think about what I can do!  Age has taken some of my attention away and Impulse has given me the ability to bring it back
5,Bella.alleB,You can test on a bunch of things and their are games to you can use it for free just hit the x on it once you get offers to buy smt. Ok I am updating this RIGHT NOW the just sent me a message thanking me for my ‚Äúkind review‚Äù like thank you so much and the app is so GREAT. Definitely download now!
5,coco freestyle,"Nice variety of games. The very slight anxiety from the speed-based is only because I‚Äôm competitive and want to score well. Especially enjoy the quizzes to get to know yourself better, but honestly one should prolly take with a grain of salt. Better than doom scrolling!"
5,üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüñêüèæ,Just got it last night because I have nothing else to do when my wife falls asleep so I play this app 10/10 so far. Probably way better without the ads every game but I guess that‚Äôs why you pay for the subscription!
5,Why do we read names,"I honestly think it‚Äôs really good. However they need to add more games. Overall it was worth it, though there were a little more ads then I would have liked so I got the subscription but overall it is a good app and I recommend it."
3,Kylie_77,"I‚Äôve been using the Impulse app for years, and have absolutely loved it until the update that happened within the last week. I liked having 5 different games to play each day, but since the update, the same 3 games play over each day. I loved having the variety of different games before the app update."
5,411 food,Stress has been a lot lately so in order for me to focus and help with memory I wanted to Try out this app called Impulse it really helps me stay focused and sharp. Learn how to slow down and take everything in and they‚Äôre short and quick fun games.
5,LumbeeRN,Impulse Brain star is an awesome game. I have a very difficult time winding down at night when I get home from work.   After my shower an I‚Äôm in bed I start Impulse Brain Star and before I know it all my stress and worries from the day have melted away. I recommend this game to everyone.
5,Pokun113,"I have bought the lifetime version as a way to support the developers. I like the app and what it has to offer, slowly build up the confidence in training. I would also appreciate if there are more creative grammatical games to boost the language skills."
4,gurrenLogan,"Hi there, reaching out here as I‚Äôve tried other avenues to no avail-  First of all, great app. Love it. However, i paid to remove adds from the candy sort game and have since changed phones but still using the same appleID, yet it refuses to restore my purchase. I even have receipt from apple for the purchase. Please help"
5,Zidane Lionheart Strife,"This app is incredible, all the games are fun and the tests are informative and interesting. $99 for a year but they give you a 92% discount (that‚Äôs what I got) so I just subbed for a year. Totally worth it so far. I don‚Äôt mess with games on apps, I play PC games, but this gets me through the day on a good mood."
3,Macra440,"Enjoyed it at first and felt the subscription was worth it. Ultimately got bored of the repetition and got a little lazy so I let it sit for a while.   Finally got back to it and the daily puzzles were among my least favorite. Either way, I didn‚Äôt finish all 5 games, thinking it would reset the next day. 7 days in a row and it‚Äôs still the same 5 games. Over and over.   I get that there‚Äôs a training aspect and I‚Äôm probably getting these games because I score lower on them but sometimes it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt care enough to focus. No amount of motivation will get me to apply myself when swiping arrow directions.  Canceled my subscription."
5,Lkarbelnig,"Growing up with Dyslexia I had to become good at learning it did not come to me as easily as some others. That being said, I love learning, staying sharp, and keeping up with the things I‚Äôve learned along way. This app makes it easy to do just that!"
5,Jjman575733889,"It does not take long to complete daily challenge but the effect is immediate and long lasting. It helps to prime your brain for a greater focus, problem solving and attention to details. It helps me to wake my brain up in the morning and begin productive day."
5,AshleyAw3some,These games are enjoyable. They seem easy however I know they are a good brain challenge for sure! It uses knowledge we learned and memorized in grade school or those earlier years of repetition so it seems knowledge we already have just don't use often
5,Devynpmua,"I‚Äôve had horrible brain fog for almost a year now from medications. I truly feel more alert and can think quicker and clearer since using the app daily! And unlike most adhd apps, I didn‚Äôt get bored after a day and stuck with it."
5,TexasHasHurricanes,This game is great to keep your brain active or reactivated.  Highly recommend it to everyone as a way of making sure your brain stays sharp.  If you are already struggling with memory issues please consider trying this game to improve your memory.
5,THIEVING APP,I used to always use my phone constantly and wasting my brain away with a bunch of dopamine inducing apps. This app really has helped me since last year with my mental cognition whenever I felt myself slipping with my mental health. Love this and the ideas thank you!!üôèüèΩ
4,Mstori880,"I hate playing games, but this app is fun. My husband and son are playing it too! I would subscribe if they had family sharing. All these subscriptions are getting expensive, especially when you have to purchase per person and have a family of 5."
1,Scam47745854,"There is no way to delete this app after ‚Äúdownloading free trial.‚Äù It does not show up under subscriptions, and it automatically charges you after free trial ends. This app is a money making scam and the developers should be ashamed. Many many many reviews on the internet reporting the same thing. So sad that the developers of this app went to college, studied the magical language of computer science, in order to scam people for money instead of actually implementing some measurable good in the world."
4,ANDIEE93,"I enjoy the game a bit. I play without paying any money in. My only thing I don‚Äôt like when I didn‚Äôt the tests, to see the results I have to pay. I‚Äôve never paid for a game and I won‚Äôt start now.  Outside of that, I love to play the different games. It keeps me focused and had helped me realize in areas I struggle in."
1,Mcbard,"I got the free 3 day trial.  Which hello means you get to use everything for free for 3 days.   I take the archetype test.  Spent 30 minutes answering all the questions and at the end, oh you only have access if you pay for the upgrade.  This should have been stated before I took it.  A good business model wouldn‚Äôt rely on tricking people into paying money.  If the product is good you wouldn‚Äôt need to do that and people would just continue to use it, glad  to pay."
5,crom827,"I like the games-there are many to choose from and they‚Äôre challenging. I like that the score tally will tell me where my skills fit in with my peers-when that number is lower than I‚Äôd like, it make me want to do it again to score higher."
2,Paygel,The ads on the free version are ridiculously long. I read another review where the developer said to just x out of the app after 7-10 seconds and that would be great except the x doesn‚Äôt show up until way longer than 7-10 seconds. I do click the x as soon as it appears but it takes sometimes longer than a minute! Annoying. Will delete the app.
5,Mount_Vito,"This is a great app that is filled with games that make you think and think quickly, but also is so much fun to play. The price is a little steep if you choose to pay weekly, but their deal on an annual plan for around $20 for the whole year is worth it"
4,SatyaSeeker,"For someone with an aging neurodivergent brain it‚Äôs important to continue to try to improve my executive functioning as well as working memory. I feel like the games in this app do just that, but only take up a few minutes of my time and attention per day. A win in my books!"
3,trubex,If it‚Äôs for real then it‚Äôs a great way to get a workout. It‚Äôs fun and bright colors. There‚Äôs a lot of communication. You ask questions that have right or wrong answers. Not in between. It‚Äôs a nice swift game. Well I want to go back to playing it. I will think of other ways it can ‚Äúimprove‚Äù but none come at the moment possibly because my brain got a workout and it‚Äôs tired.
5,iConvertible,I love the daily exercises that keep me sharp. The games are practical for the brain because it helps your brain recall things that it already knows how to do. The faster you become with it the brain grabs up much more knowledge of concepts that you will need later. Awesome App!
5,EmilyGrace24,"I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days, so I‚Äôm still anxious to see how the games change over time, but I‚Äôm really enjoying so far. I haven‚Äôt paid for the premium yet but I may, because the ads really are annoying. ü´§"
5,njferrell,I absolutely love this game.. I have memory trouble a lot and this game helps me to train my memory and challenges me to really think about how to solve some of the problems.. it give detailed instructions if it‚Äôs a new game and it tests me in different ways and helps me be more confident in myself!!!
5,MMARN4,As a mom to a preschooler I am keen to idea of rewarding good behavior and it fueling positive behavior. I get it in a psychological level even more when I play these. It feels good to get things right! The games are fun. It becomes a race against yourself and their totally addictive suddenly 20 min passes in a flash. I highly recommend!
5,Kdog22!,This app is helping me overcome my ADHD and procrastination habits. I have begun to use it everyday for at least 15 minutes. It feel like my brain is finally breaking out of the toxic instant gratification pattern that it has been in for the past few years.
4,Miss Williams88,"It‚Äôs a little easier than I thought. It could be a a little more challenging. Either way, it is still a good app to have when your bored or need to pass time. Wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the better features but nothing in life is free right?!"
5,Pretty Rikki97,I feel like being able to do things that actually test your brain helps improve in many ways! I just started but I plan on doing this as often as I can for my health and to get myself mentally better!
3,Jetii,The daily three puzzles are broken ‚Ä¶. I can play the first two but the last looks already played and the day is not registered as played. I really enjoy this app but this has happened for three days now‚Ä¶. I tried to report to support but the button to send the request is not working too. Please fix as I love using this daily.
5,Ericygo93,Have been loving this app. The only thing I wish you could do is have shared access among iPhone family members so they may be able to enjoy the app as well
4,Rainbows and awesome,"I totally get making money off people buying ads free but I‚Äôm taking a star away because you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to train your brain. Other than that, the games are SO FUN! It take like 10 seconds to just skip the ads and play the games. It is what it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,"Smart, Mark","I find these games to be very very helpful for me. I never did very good and well in math when I was in school but the math seemed fairly simple so I got quite a few correct. An avid recycler so and I know colors well, so putting the red in the trash, and the blue in the recycling was just natural for me."
5,olivialazooo,"Fun and stimulating! The price for a year, in my opinion, is fantastic compared to other brain training apps trying to charge anywhere from $50-$100! I recommend for anybody, even though the levels aren't hard enough for me yet it's stimulating."
5,OhioTamasha,"After hard days, I want something mindless to help settle me to go to bed. This is better than ridiculous television and I don‚Äôt strain my eyes trying to read a book. Anytime I have a few minutes to kill, I pull this up! Love it!"
5,FilBilly RayRay,"This is a great app to get your mind out of the usual norm of why you are on your phone and helps with focus and brain stimulation. Worth to pay the money.  You‚Äôll get an option to pay yearly, maybe for even $30 a year. Check it out! Try it out!"
4,Lima60,"I am happy with the app ,it is very helpful, but since 2 weeks ago, I am receiving only three daily recommended assignment, not five or six like before. I tried to look for your phone number, and there is no way to get it and call to let you know, hopefully I will get an answer from you."
5,Dog6021YT,"As you may see in the title, I don‚Äôt do many reviews so it is a rare thing, but I really love this app (I hope it doesn‚Äôt make me pay later) and I think it‚Äôs great for self improvement and mind improvement, üíØrecommend!"
5,VadymK,Highly recommend you try it out. Not only it‚Äôs a good brain training app but there is a one time payment and no monthly payments like other apps seem to love to do. Give it a chance and try it out and buy it for life if you love it too.
5,ShainaDay,"The free version of this app is just enough for me. Three mental challenges each day; it‚Äôs quick, it‚Äôs fun, and it‚Äôs challenging. I wish there wasn‚Äôt such a long ad before each challenge but other than that, I‚Äôve enjoyed the app!"
1,lsalazaar,"All of your ads talk about finding your brain type or adhd type or whatever, but not even one of these reports is available in the free trial. This makes your ads seem quite misleading.  Your response says ""Please be aware that on a free or trial plan, you will still have access to basic results only, such as your IQ score, trauma response type, archetype, ADHD type, etc."" This is not true. You cannot see what ADHD type you are without paying money."
4,YaoiOtaku,"I don‚Äôt go for app games usually- but the aesthetic they used looked nice in the ad I got and the puzzles are really fun! It‚Äôs also on the ‚Äúshort and sweet‚Äù end of app games. And they‚Äôre all different puzzles so it isn‚Äôt boring to play, ya know?? Plus- it gives a score based on people in your ranges results and I always think that‚Äôs fun. ^^‚Äù"
5,marschun,"I wanted to try out this app because I‚Äôve been looking for something fun for my 70 year old mom to use. We all age and this is a fun app that helps people stay sharp. After playing with it for my free trial, I‚Äôve decided to buy the lifetime version for my mom to use."
4,Nep Deep,"I love the app so far, but have some slight issues. 1. Can‚Äôt easily find the personality test results for the tests I have already done. Haven‚Äôt found them at all actually, maybe not used the interface‚Ä¶  2. Sometimes I swear I hit the right tiles and it says I‚Äôm wrong but I swear I give the same answer again and it‚Äôs right. I think it‚Äôs probably me and also the app but definitely feels off sometimes. 3. Sometimes it‚Äôs very easy to hit wrong button if you tap slightly off. If your finger is slightly slipped. That changes the score. Maybe larger buttons? Overall I like the app so far!!!"
1,Brittsimmer,This app isn‚Äôt at all what I thought it would be but it‚Äôs my fault for not reading about it. I thought  that it was more like therapy videos and self reflecting sort of stuff. So I clicked to subscribe and I thought that I could just cancel at anytime without having to pay but boy was I wrong. I‚Äôve now learned my lesson ugh! It‚Äôs unfair; I think to undermine people and just take our money! Now I‚Äôll know next time there‚Äôs a no free trial; to not even bother trying it out!! What a scam.
5,MatanYlevy,"Have been in therapy forever and this app literally is a game changer.  It lets you works on you your way, not the therapist or books only way. When you actually invest the time to work on yourself you see greater results"
5,RSsudzyfox,"Most apps fail to keep and hold my interest this not only fixed that but improved my cognitive functions so I love it everything is a positive, especially since they made it accessible to everyone and not charge for the most simplest aspects."
5,Best first audio book,I like that it gives you options of what to develop and the games are pretty fun! Quick dopamine release when you see how you‚Äôre doing well - also like the feedback in how I‚Äôm comparing to others in a similar demographic.
5,smccar06,"I like the games a lot and I‚Äôm very picky. They are challenging but still fun. Not a fan of the ads but I already have so many bills, not trying to pay for another one. The free version is very enjoyable but the ads are enough to make a person insane."
5,Snavsava,"This site is wonderful. It helped me focus more on my memory and it helped me realize my IQ level, and how far I could go in life, it also help me realize that I could do better in school that I am already doing, I really appreciate this app, and what it does for people."
5,Miri the scari,"As someone who has a learning disability, math has always been hard for me. I was so worried about being intimidated ((yes even on an app)) but this was actually really easy.   I love the games - they make my brain like‚Ä¶ wake up? It‚Äôs like it stimulates my brain. I really love it."
5,SueLyn-Boston,"The games in this app are really interesting‚Äîmore than in other similar apps I‚Äôve tried‚Äîand the UI (the directions, feedback, etc) have a sensible and friendly tone. highly recommended!"
5,Grace 2 u,"The training is a mind awakening. I am enjoying it everyday. I really like the challenges, easy to comprehend instructions and follow. It‚Äôs a great mental keep up especially in my age, retired and less responsibilities since my kids are all grown ups. Thank you for creating this wonderful mental exercises."
5,Jasercise,"For someone who is diagnosed with cancer, and has had multiple surgeries in a short amount of time along with treatment my cognitive skills memory have been not what they used to be. However, I find that this Apple loan has helped me improve substantially."
5,Great God of Fire,"Just started, no idea if it will actually help improve my brain function, but it HAS to be better than scrolling social media!!   The games are fine, tons of variety and difficulty and the app is soiled, intuitive with no glitches."
2,mc_CLOUD,"While the library of games is pretty good, I‚Äôve been a subscriber since the app launched and new games/content are released maybe 1 time every 3 months.   Also, on some games like Words Crossword, you have to watch ads to get additional hints. I would be ok if I wasn‚Äôt already paying a subscription. Also, the ads are the sketchy type that force you to download the app in the ad before receiving a hint."
5,Catchureye ,I‚Äôve been needing a break from social media and this app is serving as the perfect replacement during my 30 day detox ‚Äî it‚Äôs  actually strengthening my mental faculties instead of dulling them. Grateful to have found this app during my social media detox!
5,weeertty,It seems the number I get older and years the slower my brain seems to process things. My cognitive functions are slipping in before they get out of hand I‚Äôm trying to use my brain in a different way every day and it‚Äôs helping. So far.
1,edifyme2,"In order to cancel the ‚Äòfree‚Äô trial you have to go through Subscriptions on your account and it has to be 24 hours before the end of the trial. It‚Äôs been 2 days since I signed up for it and it‚Äôs still not showing up in my subscriptions to be able to cancel in time. I‚Äôm emailed them at 2 different support emails and no one has responded. I‚Äôve reported them to Apple as fraud. Very scammy! DO NOT TRUST! This is the second one star review I‚Äôve tried to post, the other one never showed up."
5,Galact0,Just simple brain things just keeps me busy when I‚Äôm bored and you can never stop play! Very addictive and you can get a free trail as a start so you can see if you like and you can cancel the subscription anytime you like! Hope this review helps you.
5,DNorth1418,"I work out my body every day‚Ä¶.my brain is part of my body‚Ä¶logically I need to work out my brain. Love the quick fun games, haven‚Äôt been playing long but hope with dedication I start to see improvements in my recall, focus and general cognitive strength."
5,BusyBodyHank,I work in a fast paced environment where your eyes and brain activity are constantly moving and bouncing around and with Impulse I am allowed to decompress from my days activities in a fun educational way. Definitely will try with my kids. Thank you!!!
5,bunnynoodle,"I enjoy using this app. I feel like I‚Äôm utilizing my time wisely as far as choosing what types of games to play. Even though I may use it once in a while, I can definitely see in improvement in my focus, decision making, and memory skills."
5,Iihgfryjbcf,If you‚Äôre wasting time on your phone you might as well be working out your brain. Games simple enough for the short attention span of wannabe influencers but complex enough for those taking a break from reading.
2,Obadoba,"Cool app, puzzles and games reminded me of another app that I used a few years ago. That being said, uninstalled the app within 30 minutes of use. (Enough time to complete one of the IQ tests) My reason for deleting the app was due to every other screen asking me to subscribe. I understand most of these apps monetize their functions as a way to maintain the app and stay relevant, but there is a difference between a quality application and a gatcha game."
5,KrazeeKansasGma,"WOW this exercise is really brain exercise.  It‚Äôs completely different than the brain games I‚Äôve been playing!  It‚Äôs a challenge and unlike multiple choice, matches, or word games, this one will make you feel glad when you complete the daily tests!"
4,DeJa Renee LLC,I just downloaded the app and it‚Äôs been pushing me in a healthy way to continue to play these brain games and get my brain going in the morning as well as helping me slow it down at night! I would definitely recommend it for someone who is looking for more stimulating apps to help with productivity.
5,Jonsnosemom,"This is not a game, this is way better, this is not some old lying game, its a real and awesome way to train ur brain for memory, focus, and even people with ADHD which would be me, focus and memory is my main problems, so this helps a lot, i guarantee this will help, i suggest trying it"
5,alasadagd,"I love puzzles and I love challenging my mental state to help me stay sharp, focused and alert. This game does it all for me. It measures my performance metrics and even allows me to play mini games after doing my daily quizzes. Plus they have enough free content to occupy time without paying for a subscription. Great app!"
5,Myfirstandlastnames,"This app has so many games that scratch my itch for mathematical thinking üíö I work in a creative field so math is not something that I practice day to day, and it‚Äôs had an impact on my focus and memory. Three days into these games and I feel the benefit of playing, sharpening my attention, and I LOVE them all."
5,Kyle Silvestre,"I never saw mental workouts as helpful or  as necessary as physical workouts. Impulse has helped me realize how important mental workouts are. I have only tried it for a few days but I can see that with consistency, my mental efficiency will improve. Great app with accessible pricing!"
5,DrumaStyle39,I just just want to rate this game 5 stars hands down its releases high anxiety it‚Äôs strengthens your mind and your concentration it‚Äôs something to do while your on a short break long ride or if you have bad anxiety. Test yourself to try and go the limit unless for you there‚Äôs no limits at all
5,megroe30,"I have only been using the app for two weeks and already see a difference in my cognition. I am able to recall things better, make better decisions quickly, and honestly it‚Äôs help to improve my mood! Thanks so much for this awesome app!"
5,Curtinly,I used to play brain training games on Nintendo DS and loved them. I decided to try this app out because my friend mentioned it. I like the games and I like that there are different tests you can take. I recommend this game if you don‚Äôt want your brain to turn to mush.
5,JAG912,"Maybe I‚Äôm just ADHD‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been doing these puzzles and practices in my mind since I was a child. Focusing through the app gives rhythm and reason to the practice. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to sharpen their most effective tool, their mind."
5,Marvey8,I just started working with this app and really enjoy it. It gives me a few minutes each day to sit down and exercise my brain. I look forward to progressing to a little harder games each day.
5,kittyhz4u,So far this app has helped me with getting my memory being back more on track where it was when I was younger. The games are fun little games and I enjoy them. The quizzes are an enjoyable side bonus as well. Keep up the good work y‚Äôall.
5,Fila chick,I‚Äôve tried a couple of apps and got bored with them. This Impulse seems a bit more measured and interesting so far so I‚Äôm looking forward to my training each evening. Early days but I‚Äôd recommend trying it to see if it is a good fit.
4,yeahgene,I get bored with the lights and tasks and minutia of games on apps. This helps my brain to completely disengage and focus on worthy games. Brain fog is real with adhd and this allows a focus outside of all the things we need want or don‚Äôt want to do. Dopamine hits from doing well. Enjoying it. Two day streak so far.
5,Mikehblaze96,this app has let me learn so much about myself from there many different tests they have and I enjoy playing there games to help with training my brain I think the app develop did a great job with the design of the app as well as the instructions for the game
5,Did you know kenz,I like it so much is is one of the best things I have ever downloaded. I like it because it has fun games plus you learn at the same time üòç it tracks so many things and it is cool I recommend this game so much so please download it.
5,jcat's iTunes,I‚Äôm using the free version & I disabled notifications so it doesn‚Äôt add stress to my life so I can just play when I want to. It does make you think. It builds difficulty levels as you go and shows how your performance compares to other users.
5,Rima123456789,I just started because I can‚Äôt focus and just drift through the days after I started using this app I‚Äôm hopeful it has a lot of games and things to do and it‚Äôs fun plus the full access was only like $24 for a year
5,ElDedo1,Lots of fun with great brain teasers to test you through out your day. Nice to keep your self engaged while keeping your mind sharp instead of doom scrolling on social media like the normal modern zombie these days Go out for a walk get some sun instead and do this from time to timeüòâüëç
1,Jenna Frank,"Wasted time answering 40 questions just for a screen at the end saying I need to pay to see my results. Tell us before we answer all those questions! They know exactly what they are doing. Hope the temporary money is worth all the lost respect from your users and possible positive recommendations to others. If this app ever gets brought up in conversation I will make sure to tell people exactly what it is, a money hungry creator with a app that‚Äôs waste of time and a deception."
5,claireespo,I really enjoy this app. It challenges you and keeps your mind sharp. You can tell that the creators put a lot of thought into how the mind truly works and what exercises and games would help improve the brains overall performance.
2,EnnaRenee,So I thought this would be a fun game and a way to get to know myself a little bit more and possibly improve some skills. I went ahead and paid for a subscription the basic level one $6.99 a week and it won‚Äôt even tell me a detailed result for any of the tests; it gives me a one-word answer and ask for more money to see the ‚Äúreport‚Äù I find that annoying to say the least.
5,SnickerDoodleJules76,So far I absolutely love this app. I have been able to learn so much about my processing styles and how to improve them. I‚Äôve been able to work on my short term memory which has been an issue for years.
5,Akash B,I like this app because I usually use it to play the mini games in between tasks I do throughout the day. The app is very responsive and I enjoy the new games that are added from time to time
5,darlbh,"I genuinely do not enjoy phone games. Too much story, too many things to collect‚Ä¶Blah blah blah. I like that this is simple and actually makes me feel like I am practicing skills. I like to zone out at my phone just like everyone and this may actually be benefiting my brain‚Ä¶win win."
5,Dvmares,"Coming from a family that is prone to Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. I feel that it is necessary for me to keep my brain active, so I don‚Äôt fall into that category when I get older. I love the games and I love how user-friendly it is."
1,BoomBoomBase,"I found this app on an advert and downloaded out of curiosity and boredom.  This app offered a free trial to pro but when I clicked it ended up charging me.  I tried to cancel straight away and report it for refund but was denied.  Furthermore; since my refund was denied, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have full access to this app but as it happens, I don‚Äôt.   So now you‚Äôve taken my money without the service you claim to provide for it.  Where is the ZERO start option???"
5,Ruby Q Mace,It‚Äôs good because all ages can play it like my daughter that is 16 or my other son that is 10 they both wanted to play it and I love it because there‚Äôs so many different options of games and it helps my brain. And my daughter that is 7 she loves it.
5,Midnight Tee,"If you want to maintain your mind strength then this is a great game to play. Even if you need to build it back up then your definitely playing the right game!! You will have loads of fun doing it, just check it out you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!"
5,Manxis107,Mentally kickstart your day the right way! End the mindless scrolling through social media or browsing the new inbox delivery as soon as your eyes open and stimulate that reality bending world changing orb of meat that sits between your ears instead. Really. Start today.
5,AH-STL,Always believed I was stupid.  Didn‚Äôt go to college but started my own businesses and previously was the highest grossing sales rep and later BP of marketing and advertising.  Can read and speak Hebrew and lead orthodox Jewish services. Was always scared to take IQ tests for fear they would prove that I‚Äôm a dummy   Thank you
5,yp apliance solutions,"So far I have been working with the app since yesterday and I love it, it's interesting all games and stuff that they have to keep your mind in shape. I always try to get the app to help me maintain my brain in shape but this one so far has everything I only one app."
5,claire without the i,"I‚Äôm enjoying these games. I‚Äôm doing better than I thought I would. I‚Äôm have no idea if this will train me to be more attentive or creative, but right now it‚Äôs enough that it‚Äôs more fun and relaxing than lots of the apps /puzzles where there endless ads."
2,MissChristyM,"I recently tried this app.  There are some interesting brain games. However, I tried this game as a free trial. I did cancel more than 48hrs before my trial ran out and they still charged me for the 2nd week.   I tried contacting and no response as of yet to refunding me.   I don‚Äôt suggest trying this unless you actually are prepared to pay weekly for the app."
2,Autumnmariah,"I wouldn‚Äôt know of what is in the app is worth anything. I doubt it is, after encountering my first paywall and going the annoying steps I took a test that was ammture, stupid, and filled with nonsense questions. It was long and irritating. When I finally finished I hit yet ANOTHER paywall. Even though I have agreed to pay after a 3 day subscription it demanded I payed more to get results.  I wasted my time, DONT waste yours"
5,A‚Äôs pov,"This is easy to do and incorporate into your day. They are simple, fun games that pass the time. Why not do some good brain stuff in the process instead of just watching videos or just zoning out? I like it. I‚Äôd recommend the app to just about anyone."
5,TexasEins,"I've always known that brain training is good for my mental health, Memory, and Cognition but I never had the time to sit down and actually do it. Impulse let's me set a realistic amount of time each day to do a quick brain workout and the games are fun too!"
5,Bunny girl üê∞‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíãüíãüêá,I love this app I only got it two days ago and I love it so far the games are simple and fun. I love the variety of games and how they‚Äôre all heated towards a different way of brain training. If your thinking about getting this app I would definitely recommend it. üß†ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑
5,SerenaAnneKat,"I have found, since I‚Äôve been getting older, my memory has been getting a bit difficult, but playing this game I have seen an improvement over these past few week. I totally recommend for any age."
5,Briole,I just started using this app and so far it‚Äôs pretty cool. Definitely makes me focus. When I have a flare up with my fibromyalgia my brain fog makes it hard to concentrate on things. And I am stuck at home in pain. This app keeps my mind busy with good stuff vs mindless crap.
5,sterrrling,"quite literally just installed and began using this app. I‚Äôve played one memory game and so far so good, but it‚Äôs early. üëçüèª constructive feedback: if at all possible, don‚Äôt prompt users to rate and submit feedback on the application during their first session."
5,an super hot white shirt,I thought I could only enjoy this to have a subscription but that‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôll pressures you in the beginning but the ads aren‚Äôt that bad that you can‚Äôt enjoy what it has to offer. It‚Äôs only been a few days but I think the app is pretty cool. -DAJ
5,Vyesal,"If you want to push your mental training to the next level, look no further. The daily challenges will get the ball rolling and pushes you to achieve higher scores with each task. Absolutely love this appt and I highly recommend you download it."
5,chey.hoover,"I don‚Äôt typically leave app reviews, but I truly enjoy this app. They say your memory fades over time and this helps me feel like I‚Äôm doing my best to strengthen it. Some of the games are really challenging and make me actually think. A drastic difference from the mundane!"
4,JPC2020,I can only play this on my iPhone as the progress doesn‚Äôt sync across devices. Wish I could play in both my iPhone and iPad but they would be at different levels. Is there any way to create an account so that my progress is saved across devices? Thanks
5,Juliet Mac,"I have a brain injury from a car wreck. I have great long term memory, but my short term memory is impaired. This helps so much with exercising my short term memory, and I am a believer that the more you exercise your memory/brain deficits from an injury, the better it may become."
5,Piglettpie,I‚Äôm having a great time with this app. I‚Äôm naturally competing and I love to improve my scores. Some of the games and tests can get pretty tricky but you walk away feeling accomplished. Even if you‚Äôre spending 5 - 10 minutes a day on it. Happy with the purchase.
5,vigpoi,"A lot of games and apps like this have apps but they aren‚Äôt skippable and quick. Impulse is free and will meet you to your level and after a few questions, will know what in your brain you want to train. Overall, impulse is really fun and great for your brain."
5,Madmaxlp,"Impulse truly works and challenging toward your individual skill levels! I am on the 3rd daily challenge; I tell you, so far so good! I highly recommend this app to anyone willing to challenge their current impulse skills and also elevate their cognitive thinking üí≠ ‚úîÔ∏è"
5,gddgxhdh,"I love impulse so much! It‚Äôs great it helped me get better grade at school! I do wish all options were free, but there is a good selection to play! And you can chose your problem areas to get better! I‚Äôve only had it for about a week, but I love it so much! Thanks Impluse!!ü•≥"
1,23456seveneight,I got a deal yesterday that said I would be paying $0.57 each week and then it took out $28. Which is ridiculous to me. If you‚Äôre going to charge that much then don‚Äôt even put the weekly payment because it‚Äôs not real. They charge the full price right then and there. Anyways that all I have to say I really hope they fix that. I want my money back in all honesty. Don‚Äôt download the app. I personally believe after reading the good reviews that most of them are fake.
5,FupaSurgeon,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs doing anything for my  brain, but I do enjoy doing the exercises. I have had a few concussions, so even if it‚Äôs just a somatic effort, at least it helps me feel better. I do recommend it. If you have any doubt about your sharpness, give it a try."
5,Seek Harmony,"I am on bright when I have some free time at work or when I am bored. For instance, I completed some IQ tests today while I was lying down. I found out so much about my personality and emotional intelligence. Recommend if you are interested in improving your cognitive abilities."
5,unsweetenedreams,I‚Äôve played a lot of mind games and tried many apps but this one is unbeatable. Not only does it have limitless games for free it also works your brain instead of having kid mind games they‚Äôre actually very sufficient and they keep you entertained ü•∞
3,Pdizzle194,I bought this game for the one-time payment so that my investment would be sound if I ‚Äútrain my brain‚Äù daily. I enjoy the games a lot and the results help me better understand my strengths and weaknesses. But it is unclear what measurements they evaluate and how the algorithm works. Perhaps if there was a little bit more transparency ‚Äî considering this is MY brain ‚Äî I would rate this app higher.
5,DocteurN,"Great app for making your brain work in ways that you may not use as often as you should. Just like a workout, some areas may need more attention, but everything gets challenged just the same."
5,JazziStar99,I have severe memory problems due to a lifelong seizure disorder and I really think this game is really gonna help me to ‚Äúwork my brain out‚Äù bc like any other muscle the less you use the more you lose! So I‚Äôm very greatful to yal for making these vital brain exercises so fun and easily accessible!!
5,big tuna 84,It‚Äôs a really well structured game that has many levels of play and will absolutely have you thinking a whole lot more at the end of your play. It test different cognitive attributes and I think they did a great job putting this together.
5,snap@ william1330,Pretty fun deal tell you a lot about yourself you get yourself a free three day trial go ahead and take them up on that offer within your first day they give you a year subscription offer for half off go ahead and did it like $20
1,Mieczkowski,"I bought the full member ship which is about fourth dollars and I did this before I Astarte using the application and it was a mistake for sure. The game I saw advertised is not even one they offer and I‚Äôve been doing this for fifteen days and every single day it prompts me to set a reminder to so my daily exercise. There is no way to turn off that and just overall I would say save your money I am sure there are much better products available, that are more affordable and honest in their advertising."
5,Reviewsrobert,"This app trains both sides of the brain and you will start to notice improved memory, enhanced decision making skills and precise concentration. The daily games allow you to track a daily streak to monitor your progress and hold you accountable. Download today !"
4,Bluesheep9,I love this app but there are a few ads and I don't want to pay for a subscription.  This is a great app if you have anything mentally that you would like to improve. There isn't many ads but you have to pay for a subscription to view your test results.
5,AR.1983,This is a great game. They recommend fun activities that keep your mind sharp. Just started doing it but I already paid for the year subscription. Look forward to taking the IQ test recommend anybody at least a one week trial.
5,Slm1126,"I like that it exercises the brain, something you might not think about doing too often. My favorite and the most satisfying part to me is how it compares your scores to others in your age group. It‚Äôs cool to see the results especially if you‚Äôre above average."
5,Blu3_Kn0t,This game keeps my finger and brain firing quickly.  Easy games with the ability to keep me wanting to play more.  Just wish it didn‚Äôt cost anything. After all the ads pop up more then I would like.
2,alexmac30,"Extremely frustrating experience trying to figure out what the app even was or if I wanted to pay for it when every other screen is a pop-up trying to get you to pay immediately. Was trying to enjoy the free trial, but honestly just deleted after 10 mins. Seems like it could be a decent app but I‚Äôve lost interest at this point."
5,Alock86,"I only downloaded this app for the tests I.e. IQ, Trauma brain, etc. but the games are easy to give 5 minutes of your day and are helpful while actually fun. As someone who suffers from depression, this app is something I need to help me with my working memory."
5,Piam4,I enjoy the app more than I thought I would. I have ADHD and it forces me to focus vs careless mistakes because I want to perform well and improve. I do feel that it helps me with response time as I‚Äôm trying to process quicker than usual.  Like thinking on my toes quicker.
4,Conrad_71,"Thought it was a good deal for mental awareness. Though I‚Äôm still curious as to why when I switched phones, I still cannot log into my old account where I had done tests and and challenges. How does one know progress if it changes back to new after switching phones."
5,lov3sparks,"At first I was skeptical of this simple game but I wanted to see what it was about. Now I can see! It really does work, this thing‚Äôs legit. I am currently in my free trial but considering yesterday and today I‚Äôm 95% sure I‚Äôm paying for my year. I have until tomorrow to decide"
4,bubbindl,"I really enjoy the variety and style of games it offers, but if you want to sit and play it for 15-20 minutes it‚Äôs not ideal. every other level or puzzle you'll get a popup ad, and some of them have those fake 'x's that take you to the app store."
5,Adunnam,I‚Äôve been using this App to help with recovering from a concussion and it is actually helping. Plus it gives amazing detailed information about how you Brain functions it‚Äôs strength and weaknesses. I recommend for everyone!
5,Blakeconwar,It gives you things that you didn‚Äôt know and it tells you the percentage of people are the same as you or it can tell you by if you‚Äôre better than others.
3,stefanschaefer,Cool app lots of interesting stuff but the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù isn‚Äôt a free trial at all. It‚Äôs just a marketing gimmick so they can try and convert you to a subscriber using manipulation. They don‚Äôt actually let you see the results for anything until you subscribe. Which they give you a ‚Äú90%‚Äù discount for to make you think you‚Äôre getting a steal.   Interesting app. Sleazy business practice.
3,greywolf53000,"See, ads themselves are okay, but when i am on a streak in connect the dots and an ad pops up i get soooo mad! Tips that should be added, less ads and 10-12 age group. My Iq is 128 and I‚Äôm 11 but when i took an advanced and quick Iq test it put me below 90. I would rate this a five if they could fix these things, but overall its a fair thing"
4,IndicaSativacorn,Way over rated and a pompously over flaunted app since a fat lot of good it does when it wants $4.99 per ‚Äúreport‚Äù or $6.99 weekly just to let you read your test results. No thanks. I can get more accurate and actual psychological test parameters for free from the books these ‚Äútests‚Äù are based off of.
5,jhhihiji,This is by far one of the best brand games I have ever used. It has different daily activities for you to do it tells you your percentages on how you did and it barely has any ads.
2,CutieCucumberüíó,"Ridiculous that I have to pay to use it. You can improve by finding some way (other than a 3 day free trial) to keep at least a portion of the app free. Do this especially for students or those who are budgeting, but also want to reap the benefits of using an app for brain training. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the app seems great and has potential."
5,MJH55,"This is great how it targets selective areas to work on (ie memory, attention, etc). Haven‚Äôt seen this targeted approach in other brain-building apps! And you can select the amount of time spent brain-training per day. Only down side is that you have to pay."
5,calebslostjournal,"It is a great game. Unlike other things in life, it is 100% accurate. If you get it wrong you get it wrong. If you get it right, well then you get it right. It keeps my brain moving while I am off this semester from college."
5,Geneticsleuth,I did not have a comparison of my brain acuity against that if my peers until I began using this app.  I see some areas where I have slipped a bit in speed and realize these are the areas I need to work on.  This app gives me the tools to do so.
5,Mrs.Rabbit24,"My husband loves theses types of apps and was using elevate but it was too ‚Äúbig brained‚Äù for me , felt like I was taking too long on some games but this one is so fun, it has small tests to learn more about yourself like your IQ, personality type and more. Great was to pass the time and exercise your brain"
5,chewie.09,I don‚Äôt really like learning but I felt like I had to improve my memory since I get brain fog a lot so I downloaded it and the games are actually pretty fun and addicting I just started it so I‚Äôm not sure on how well it works too much progress wise.
4,DHolland6,Definitely a quick helpful way to keep the brain sharp! Wish it was slightly less expensive. The big 92% off deal helps but I‚Äôd rather be able to use that deal and pay monthly rather than whole year. I‚Äôll stick with free version until that is changed.
5,song msg Rico,"This game is the best game to play when you‚Äôre out of school because this game keeps your mind super sharp. When you go back to school everyone will think that you had summer school, but no, it was all from the game that kept your mind on and going."
3,MrsB203,"It‚Äôs only my second day using the app, but I‚Äôve been prompted to leave a review. So far, I like it. The brain training games are engaging, and they don‚Äôt require a significant amount of time to complete. There are many options for additional training games, and I have begun checking those out. After I‚Äôve spent more time with the app, I will return for another review."
5,mee466897876,This app is very user friendly and has 0 ways to scam you or codes you into buying its premium features. It made me want to pay for it. It should go without mention that the app does cavalry what it says it will do.
5,Woo-Hoo21,"Love this new app! I feel my brain getting stronger! So much better than mindless swiping. Took the personality test, after 30 years, I have the same exact personality as the professional test I took way back when. This app is right on!"
5,jayleen!,"This app has been helpful to me so far it helps my brain stay focused and rethink about life. I really love this app,one of my favorite things about this app is that there is this 7 day week game and you play a couple of little mini games to help your mind on focusing."
5,Krakendude,The games here utilize the same style of mental training as an old brain training game I use to play on Nintendo DS called Brain Age. This style has proven effective in improving problem solving and information retention so it already has a pretty solid reputation in my eyes in terms of effective methods of training.
4,TheMiddleChild101,To be honest I was pretty dumb and now that i got this app it made me feel smarter of the couple weeks and I‚Äôm going into middle school so this is helping me a lot and I‚Äôm really smart now so I hope  anyone who is reading this please download this app because it‚Äôs really good now anyway I‚Äôm gonna give this 4 stars because it deserves it üëçüèΩ
5,19TwD86,"This is what ‚Äúgames‚Äù our children and youth should focus on. Being on a phone could be somewhat healthier with these sort of games. Personally since playing this game for 5-15mins a day I feel sharper mentally, it‚Äôs like a gym session for one‚Äôs mind and people of all ages should try!"
5,Shortred82,"I consider myself a person of pretty high intelligence. Boy, was I wrong when I started playing the games. But - I got better and better. And now I enjoy beating my old scores on some games and tests. The games are explained well, and are really fun to play!!"
5,Thunder Cat,I am recovering from a a head injury and I‚Äôm trying to exercise my brain in multiple ways to help me with my recovery and though I‚Äôm just getting started I find that this is healthy mixture of exercises though I am growing tired of the Bingo ads every couple seconds.
5,vmartorano,"I already agreed to pay for this app, but after day 5 most of my games were locked unless I started a free trial to upgrade to pro. AS WELL AS making me watch a video before every game if I didn‚Äôt upgrade to pro. This is gross and scummy on the developers behalf. Take your money to Elevate."
5,Shut shutup,Starts off easy then slowly takes you up and before you know it you‚Äôre remembering things and that‚Äôs a great feeling when you thought things weren‚Äôt going right with your memory ! Games are fun too!!
5,stenkely,Keeps me thinking and working in several areas of mental practice.  I make sure to complete each day and not skip over hard ones!  Takes very little time and results are obvious in my daily life.
4,Ngram113,"The last update is now causing an issue where you cannot complete the last move. It freezes before completion. Have to exit the app and go back in, but re-entry is already in to the next level."
5,Jennyblike,At first I was skeptical so I got the three day trial while playing the game. I guess I got a percentage off for the year. I went ahead and bought it and it‚Äôs actually really helping my daughter focus more and helping her concentrate. It helps me as well. I‚Äôm loving it so far.
5,Goochie poochie,"For those of us who need to work out our brain muscles this Game definitely accomplishes that! It also helps me when I need a brain break so I can have an extended period of focus. I stop what I‚Äôm doing, play a few rounds and then get back to work!"
5,Fanciio,"I love this brain training game. Makes you think, without really exhausting yourself! Fun fun fun. My husband has this also downloaded on his phone and we compete in scoring."
2,PhillyDude01,"When I want actual mental stimulation, I stick to written puzzles and old fashioned methods. When I want something to train fast hand/eye coordination and suitable for a short attention span, this is it. Puzzles like sudoku give me much more mental stimulation than these quickly timed arcade-like puzzles. I have trouble mustering up enough interest to open this app daily, let alone maintain any type of meaningful streak."
5,estrewcrt,"This game really helped my improve my mental math skills, and it was fun learning! I love all of the games on this app and There‚Äôs also tons of fun quizzes to determine your brain type, IQ etc. only thing, maybe make a bit more available for non premium users."
5,Philipp Ti,"Rather than you scrolling your life away, get this app. It costs like one coffee a week, or $40 a year which is $.77 a week! Trains your brain and keep you focused! Thank you Impulse. P.S. Saw ad for this app on Facebook, 15min later I deleted Facebook üòÇ"
5,No 82,I like how this app exercises so many different parts of the brain. As you get older it hard to stay as sharp and sometimes your in medications that don‚Äôt help that. I‚Äôm hoping this helps me and so far I‚Äôm really liking it
5,KatRemi,"As I‚Äôve gotten older and the career that I‚Äôm in, the attention to detail is the difference between good and greatness.  So far, and I‚Äôm only on my first week, anything that  helps me sharpen & grow my attention to detail is  going to pay it forward."
5,RaphaelCash23,"This app was very nicely done. The games are simple yet effective, the tests are the same, and they ask the users for feedback on how to improve. I would recommend this to anybody that wants to improve themselves mentally or learn about how their mind operates"
5,ParkURpolarbear,"I am rehabbing my brain from a TBI, so I have since downloaded and subscribed to and or purchased a hand full of different apps. I must say this is perhaps the most clever and stimulating so far not a bad thing to say about these challenges and games and tests and on and on"
5,C.Lee.S,"It‚Äôs fun, smart, and good for you! I do it in the morning, that way I meet my goal of 10 min a day, which makes me feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something and I start the day with a positive, go get‚Äùem attitude!! It‚Äôs a win-win!"
5,Audreyh.,"i love playing these mind strengthening games, i enjoy the challenge and also i enjoy seeing how well my brain is working after all these years. you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre working because of how fun the games are!"
5,Corey2482,"I really enjoy this app! I had a head injury a little bit ago and this app is really helping me with my short term memory. I play everyday for about 10-15 mins and I‚Äôm really noticing a lot of improvements. Also, I‚Äôm loving the personality tests you can take for fun!! Great app!"
4,Loafyy,"Overall, the app is amazing. The games are very technical and analytical. I‚Äôm really enjoying myself.   However, the one drawback is the developer has not  created and/or shared any new games. I‚Äôve completed all the levels. If no more games are added, I would have no choice but to delete."
5,Chiver476,"I do enjoy the mental games that are given on this app. They do make you think critically and subjectively. Even though I don‚Äôt get them all correctly, it‚Äôs great engaging my mind on these games to hopefully help keep my mind as sharp as possible. Thx"
1,player1587,"I was charged for an entire year of subscription after two days of my three day trial period. On top of that the information given said 6.99 per week unless cancelled, not a year at once. AND the app gifted me 90% off and never reflected that in the payment it took out early. I am now in the process of requesting a refund. I feel like this is a scam hoping people will say ‚Äúoh well it‚Äôs only 30 bucks, I‚Äôll just cancel now and not fight it.‚Äù Highly unethical."
4,Dancerfromsamoa,"This app exercises remind me of those mental puzzles and I was happy to finally find an app that can at least match that quality. I just don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs subscription based. I know that it sounds slightly hypocritical considering that I own brain age, but that‚Äôs a one time non reoccurring investment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm just picky that way."
5,Fvfvgvfvg,"Love this app so much. I think it‚Äôs worth the yearly subscription, because it promotes self improvement each day. There‚Äôs many games and challenges. It‚Äôs also cool to see how you did compared to your peers. Definitely recommend!!"
5,CelestialHope15,"Impulse is much better than what I thought it would be! I really like it because of the exercises it has, I use the app in the morning when I‚Äôm still feeling tired and lazy and it wakes up my brain right away. Recommend 100% !!!"
1,jen8967,"Signed up for a 3 day ‚Äúunlimited access‚Äù trial just to find out that it won‚Äôt even give test results without a paid subscription. For that reason alone, I‚Äôm out.    Update to dev response: when you have an ‚Äúunlimited access trial‚Äù the assumption is that you have full access to the results. The trial is a preview of what you would have if you pay. Why would I pay when the ‚Äúunlimited access trial‚Äù is limited? Maybe update how you advertise that."
5,2142 to 28,I was finding that in down time all I did was doom scroll. I lost time and became more distracted. This has been outstanding. It gives me down time in a way that is keeping my cognitive skills intact and growing.
2,L3701!!,"The app content is great and interesting but be careful about the hidden costs! When it asked if I wanted ads to be removed, I paid the additional amount for no ads. However, that only removed ads for that single game within the app, not for the entire app. That was not explained and I was very disappointed after I paid for no ads to see ads continually come up while using the app."
5,maleficent10152003,I love using this in the morning. It‚Äôs a great way to start the day and wake your brain up. Sure there‚Äôs an ad every few game rounds but after a few seconds you can leave the ad. Definitely worth the ads
5,tbcbtbcbt,"The instructions are easy to understand, but just when you start to think it might me too simplistic, a change in cadence may catch you by surprise!  This is good exercise for the mind."
5,TeoTheLostBoy.,"So far I‚Äôm on the free trial and it seems like it‚Äôs fun for all ages, easy to understand when it comes to the trial and discounts and it‚Äôs just overall a well put together app. I‚Äôm definitely going to recommend this to folks. Can‚Äôt afford the app rn but I‚Äôll get back to it lol"
5,Katherina_Scorpio,"Impulse is absolutely amazing! You can test you brain to see how smart you are. And not just that, you can also use impulse to help you develop your brain even more! My grades in school went from B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs, to straight A‚Äôs! So download impulse right now!"
5,Gray'sMom,"Many interesting games, puzzles, and challenges to build brain cells. It‚Äôs not as easy as I thought it would be. I hope I improve. This thing keeps track of your progress so we will see how it goes."
5,mias opinon!,"This game helps so much! it helps you a lot it, kinda tells you stuff you don‚Äôt know about yourself! For example it tells your personality type, your gpa, etc. You will not regrets downloading this game. Like I said before it helps you a ton!!"
5,arsenal.was.taken,"I don‚Äôt know how accurate the iq tests and other tests are but its very fun to do. Even the default version is good, you can upgrade but you don‚Äôt have to. You still get everything without upgrading, you just have to wait. Its a very good app, and I don‚Äôt regret upgrading."
1,CaptainFootnotes,"It is reasonable to expect that the sample portion of an app includes at least SOME of the many tests you promote in your many, many ads. Sadly, this is not the case. In order to get any meaningful results from any quiz, you have to pony up with the cash. You might get a subscription out of me if you really let me try it first - but with all of these fake outs? No way.  IMHO, this is scammy and deceptive. (This review is based upon the MANY tries I‚Äôve given the app based on different ads FEATURING different tests)."
5,Snaucy,"I like it more than other apps of this kind. Not sure if it's actual brain traininG, but it does keep me alert while I'm using it, and I feel that it's better / more interesting than other types of games."
5,Bonitabella617,Instead of staring at Facebook or Instagram this is a great way to keep your mind sharp. Memory is something I struggle with now so this game definitely will help & also with my math skills since I‚Äôve always been lousy doing math in my head. I highly recommend this app!!!
5,Federico Fast,"Very well designed games and exercises. They push you, intrigue you, challenge you and ‚Äústress you out‚Äù in a good way. I am enjoying every session thus far and Look forward to ‚Äúthat‚Äù time of the day when I put my brain to the daily test!"
5,Buddy killer 2000,I don‚Äôt have the pro features and this is one of the only games where the normal version is just as good as pro!   Very useful to improve your training and this is absolutely the best option. Must have and highly recommended
5,asyd2020,"You have to pay to play this game, I suggest the life time membership. One and done. Besides that, I have been playing this for the past two days and I feel like I‚Äôm quicker and I feel more than refreshed. This game is just a bunch of brain food and I love it!"
5,be goid,"I like this app, but the problem is that people can bother you or try to talk to you. How can you answer them back? That wastes some time on my IQ test. People might think we‚Äôre ignoring them! I think there should be a pause bottom. The app works like it says."
5,X-tmi-X,"I Am enjoying using having a way to sharpen and entertain myself, by myself ü§≠. Consistency, that‚Äôsss what I need when I sign up only life has been faithful in arriving with ‚Äútrouble enough of it‚Äôs own‚Äù  I will return as often as allowed by this Foster Mom‚Äù of four in training ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,Ingrid Stephania,It is fun to prove your own brain skills into a few seconds and train them everyday through different exercises! It shows you statistics of your position related to all players üíê. Sadly some of the adds are uncomfortable not appropriate üòì.
5,Kellypufff,I like the break from social scrolling apps and replace it with some fun and quick brain training games you can really do anywhere at any time! Whether on break at work or at home looking for something to do!
4,Samoss61432,"The games are great, I do 10 minutes a day they have like three different games, so it‚Äôs cool, and it helps u practice focus only thing that‚Äôs annoying is that they will give you some things and then ask you to pay for them at that which is annoying"
5,moovweight,Refreshing take on brain training and if you‚Äôre doing it just for the daily help and not needing access to the entire platform you can do so with no membership. But the app will have skippable ads for the free version.
2,Tayvianfox,"The app itself seems great, I see it helps many people with dealing with their mental health and finding out about themselves. However, you do have to pay for literally everything on the app. I downloaded it because I wanted to take the tests and se my results but in order to do so, I must pay a monthly subscription. Would be great if that weren‚Äôt the case."
5,MalickMan,This training has made me more conscious of finer details of life. I pay more attention to the little things and that makes a big difference. I rarely miss a day and it has become part of my daily routine.
2,Anniejo33,"Has a 3 day trial that claims you can unlock all features without ads,  but any ‚Äútest‚Äù results are locked unless you fully commit to purchasing some form of subscription. So no, free trial to a waste of time essentially. Otherwise I‚Äôm sure the app does what it says but those red flags say ‚Äúgive me money‚Äù only and I get this thing wants to make a profit but hard pass on that."
5,Suzeeque31,"So far, this is only day 2, I am enjoying this app.  I find it helpful to train my brain especially as I feel a lot more foggy lately.  I am hoping this app can provide me some insights as it helps me improve my focus and relieves some pent up anxiety."
3,Nathan Melton,The games and the test are really cool. There‚Äôs a really good idea behind the app the only problem is that you have to pay to see your test scores. It would be nice to at least get one free so I know if the report I'm going to get is worth paying for. Highly reccomend if you‚Äôre willing to pay but if your not maybe stick to the free test on google.
5,D-Darby,You compete to outdo or better yourself. It is fun but also entertaining. I am always happy to pick it up and play while able to challenge myself.I can compare myself to others in my age group as well.
5,jamyeee,"I‚Äôm naturally a competitive person. These games will bring that out of you! But, in the best way. It makes you want to do better and improve. It‚Äôs easy to understand your scoring and areas of focus. Loving it so far. Worth it."
5,RiaynnsMommy,This app is good so far! I like how the games allow you to use different parts of your brain that you don‚Äôt really use daily! Allows you to think outside the box and be a kid again! I love doing this for 5-10 mins a day to refocus!
5,$talk,"I've only been doing the exercises a few days so I can't comment on their efficacy, but I do know I enjoy doing them. I like the variety of tasks focusing on different areas of the brain so it's really doesn't get boring."
5,Navi‚Äôs Mom,This app is great for me to engage with each day. The app provides simple and short instructions and the games get more challenging as I continue to play. I also like how the game gives me a score which encourages me to do better next time!!  Susan
5,alexis_92,I have adhd and this has helped me realize that I am smarter than my intrusive thoughts have let me believe. I‚Äôm training my brain with fun games that get progressively harder as you go. Making it both a lot of fun and a good tool to easily get better faster
5,stellRoseüåπ,"It‚Äôs your choice to pay and receive more brain games but I didn‚Äôt and Still like the ones they send me to do, some are easy some are challenging but that‚Äôs the point and I love it, so helpful."
5,Homicidesquad,"This is an amazing app that helps grow your brain in many different ways. I recommend this app for anyone that wants to improve the way your brain solves (math) problems, stores memory, and see‚Äôs order of operations.  -Definitely 5 Stars for this app."
5,Fun brain games- but costs,I really like the games. They are fun and makes my brain work quick. I don‚Äôt like that I have to pay for it. I‚Äôve been able to play a few games without paying but that won‚Äôt last long I‚Äôm sure.
5,406emmies,It‚Äôs pretty cool.  I like to see how fast my brain can work . See how smart I am .  I like the challenge. I‚Äôve been doing it in the morning to see what my skills are like compared to night time .  I get better and better the more I play .  Thank you !
1,ScamAppDetector,"Want to open the app? Pay for a plan. Want to try out the app after signing up for subscription? No problem, go ahead, but after you take one of the personality tests you need to sign up for another, different, more costly subscription or do another one time payment to get your results ON TOP OF your current subscription and trial. The predatory model and dark patterns this app uses is everything wrong with the state of apps at the moment. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
1,Mjc1031,"I am deleting this game now. The games available are ok but you can only play three of the better games a day without paying, the rest of the games are not very good. And to top it off you have to watch an ad before each game, that‚Äôs right one twenty second game then a video from 30 seconds to two minutes. It‚Äôs actually ridiculous I have never had a game with so many long ads for very little gameplay. Like I said I am deleting the game now."
5,KatieHope88,I am a bit addicted to this. I am enjoying it and I feel accomplished. It‚Äôs much better than social media and it‚Äôs a feeling of satisfaction each time I get to a new level! Highly recommend it.
5,SplitPotNot,The ability to focus your thoughts or keep them at bay to achieve each mini goal becomes a true test of your mental agility! Great tracking tool for your thinking improvements! A purposeful use of time in stark contrast to the mindless social media apps!
4,‚úãüèºüóøü§öüèº,"I‚Äôve only used the app for two days so I don‚Äôt have much to say on the app but so far it‚Äôs not bad, I saw as I think the most used or highest rated app for its category, something in the respect but the app is pleasant to look and and fun to use, I hope I get to write more as I used the app more but so far it‚Äôs really good."
5,Horbanga,Download this game and played a few rounds. I enjoy the few rounds that I played and then was prompted with an opportunity for a discount. That discount allowed me to get a yearly subscription for a very good deal. after playing it for a few days I‚Äôm really enjoying it.
5,JoannaM.,I love how challenging this game is and the fact that it‚Äôs something different everyday. It also tells you how well you scored va others that have played. I feel great about scoring better than 90% of my peers that played the same game!
5,Linzmac93,"I really like this app. It‚Äôs fun and really creative, it flows well and the content is helpful to see how you‚Äôre doing. Worth the money, I think, so definitely better than those cash games that are also fun and don‚Äôt have advertisements."
5,kaelyn88,Feel much better spending time on this than social media. I‚Äôm often over using  my phone after playing a couple rounds and have seen my screen time go down.
5,Shyteisha,"Me and my little sister is tackling at the impulse brain games to be better to think instead of instantly doing or thinking we know the correct answer, think before you do, not do before you think"
5,K√†l,The app is really good so far not sure if it‚Äôs because I paid but it‚Äôs really worth the money I know they was a free version but that didn‚Äôt offer much same as other apps but I don‚Äôt regret paying and I love the IQ and other personality tests and everything.
5,Fresh Pockets,Honestly I love these games quizzes puzzles I felt like I needed more mental stimulation in my life been using impulse for about a month and I‚Äôve seen a dramatic improvement in day to day interactions and simply remembering things focusing at work or just in a conversation
5,TryTrue,"Post the virus, I‚Äôve been struggling with brain fog and mental acuity. I saw this app and thought I would give it a shot. I‚Äôve only been using it for about a week, and I already see a different. I cannot say enough great things about this app."
5,Vols06,There are so many games to play that helps me focus and get ready for the day. Something I actually enjoy doing as well as seeing a benefit in my concentration and remove that morning fogginess. Highly recommend!
4,Greenrqt1229;),I really like the app but the stuff that I am interested in and things that will actually get your brain going more than the others cost money and I feel that when you are trying to increase you knowledge it should not have a price but I like the app and I do recommend it
5,P1nk422,"I enjoy this app so much, because these are simple games, yet keep you intrigued & motivated. There are so many to choose from and I don‚Äôt feel so lazy when I choose to play these games, as I would others. My daughter loves this app too"
1,Crackalacka2690,"Reviews are obviously bought and paid for. This app is all about ads, ads, ads!! Need I say more‚Ä¶  Update: the developer responded and basically confirmed my review.  Their app is so riddled with ads it is unusable.  It‚Äôs obviously an app that is built around ads and not an app that adds ads to help support their development.  This is the kind of garbage that apple shouldn‚Äôt allow here.  All it does is dilute the App Store for the developers who actually make good products.  I stand by my review. The app is garbage."
5,Maggielove29,On the daily it‚Äôs easy to go in Instagram or other dating apps when I go on this app it makes me feel like I‚Äôm accomplishing more then just swiping down watching every ones life. I love a challenge and this app makes me think I absolutely love this app!
3,Qtmariya,I like the games‚Ä¶.when I finally get to them.  I can‚Äôt even play a couple games to see how much I like them without 10 mins of ads that you can‚Äôt skip.  You should be able to play for a little while and THEN start getting the ads in order to upgrade and keep playing.  Makes me not even want to play.
5,Tycoon Tyme,"Lots of different games, puzzles and fun/engaging activities. IQ test are interesting also. Only thing I don‚Äôt care for is the amount of ads but they aren‚Äôt too bad most are skippable and they never interfere during the middle of actual programs."
5,DanitheHappyOne,Since I‚Äôve been playing these games my concentration has improved and my memory seems better! I‚Äôm actually winning once in a while at memory games with my grandkids!
5,LogicMF,I‚Äôve only played a few games but I really enjoy it so far. The graphics are eye-catching and intriguing the games so far have been a little bit simple but I‚Äôm hoping they start to get more complex as I go through the app.
5,mattandgina,These are the exact games they used in the testing process for measurement of my brain tumor resection progress. I know these games help keep me scoring high after my surgery. I had a grade 2 frontal lobe tumor removed and I‚Äôm so happy to see how well I‚Äôm doing post-op.
5,Sosynken6,"This is noticeably helpful with brain function. I think faster and more clearly during and after and its AWESOME! I would totally recommend it for people (like me) that struggle with being passive or procrastination, with a more ‚Äútired‚Äù or ‚Äúunsure‚Äù brain. Helps a lot!"
5,Madlove9,"I love this stuff, especially the math since it‚Äôs easy to forget math skills, and I find I have to practice them to hold onto them. It‚Äôs just like summer vacation when I was a kid, come Fall it would be back to the beginning no matter how good I was at math."
4,randomdude_79,"Honestly, this game is amazing, and I completed all the puzzles which there are 188 of. However, there is an achievement that is given to you when you complete 250 puzzles. While including the bonus puzzles, there is a total of 219 puzzles this means that it is impossible to get that achievement. Impulse, please fix this."
5,Jp775478&,"I feel smarter already but I‚Äôm not sure if I really need this since the first quiz I was 90%, the second 98% and the third was 99%. ‚ÄúMr Smartypants over there‚Äù but get this I‚Äôm ADD, OCD, Dyslexic, and barely scraped by to graduate high school with a D average. I don‚Äôt test well and I have CRS: I Can‚Äôt Remember Shi‚Ä¶.Stuff"
5,Graycen cadenhead,Impulse has so many fun games to play when I get stress I play impulse it releases stress from your body and has lots of fun enjoyable games for you to play so try playing impulse today you never know if you like it or not download today and get started.
1,Finerflower,"This app advertises lots of tests that this app allegedly has on Facebook ads. However, when you open the app to look for the test or assessment, it isn‚Äôt available. These tests revolve around ‚Äúwhat is your childhood trauma style ‚Äú etc, so I think the company is directly preying on folks going through a tough time. If the developer are advertising a specific test, the least they should do is have that advertised assessment available to the user on their app."
5,McKenzie piggy,I have had some medical. Issues that have affected my short term memory and the games on this app are part of my daily routine to treat that loss. It is really helping me work on focusing and my ability to quickly respond.
5,JesusBassGuitarChick,"My mother has Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. It runs in the family. I am really enjoying these fun games in hopes to keep my mind sharp while I‚Äôm young-ish. üòÅ     50 years old, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try! I got the lifetime app so I won‚Äôt have to worry about renewing again, and I am happy I did,"
5,El Toast-O,"Today my brain farted. Not in the usual way a brain farts, but a good one! One that farts rainbows like mine just did after playing this for 15min. You definitely want your brain to fart just like mine did so go download this app today!!!!"
5,CatDoveLoves,The games are easy to understand and there fast. I love how many different options there are per day that change to test your skills and grow your brain power.
5,gracekelone,"The games are very enjoyable and are as challenging as you want them to be. Most of the content is free, so even without paying you will get a lot out of this game. The training games actually make you use your brain, which is awesome :)"
5,div truck 1,"It would be fine if it was a one time purchase for a few bucks, but I‚Äôm not paying a monthly fee to play this game‚Ä¶ I can literally play the same game with real cards if I buy a game from target under $20"
5,Antonio Mateo Garcia,"‚Ä¶ I just wish the premium subscription was a bit more affordable but compared to other similar apps, this has been my fav and I‚Äôve only had it for less than a month."
5,DoxiemomTX,I got this app a few weeks ago and love playing. I believe this app with its customized targeted games has helped improve my quick thinking and memory skills. I get better and betterüòÅ. You have to try it!
5,H!gh$cor3,"I am not a fan of the next new app, or games. At all! I decided to try this one out and I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs so much better than I thought it would be to begin with. Let‚Äôs continue brain building Impulse. I will definitely suggest to my friends!"
1,KitKat5683,The app doesn‚Äôt even give you a chance to look around it just immediately wants your money. I would get it if it was like you have a day or two to look around but then we‚Äôll charge you but nope just answer 10 questions and pay. Or maybe if it was like these things are off limits but you can see a couple things as a trail but nope. Download this app if you want to pay for test you get free online.
5,IG Joegotthejuice__,"It‚Äôs an app that for lack of better words is mind numbing, it takes your mind off the stress of reality and puts your knowledge that you already have stored in your brain to the test! Love it already and only used it twice."
5,Thoku2000,I have been using this app for just about 2 weeks and It‚Äôs awesome! I actually feel different parts of my brain working as I complete the tasks! Excited to see what I can accomplish after a whole year!
5,Karol Lisa,"I‚Äôm really enjoying my daily challenges :).  At age 62, and retired, I worry that my brain is going to slow down.  With the challenges, and the IQ tests, I can feel good that my brain still works pretty darn good.  Hoping that with daily challenges, it‚Äôll stay that way."
5,PageMason,"I‚Äôm new to this app, but so far I love it! The different games each day seem to already have had an impact on my memory and mental sharpness. The quiz and test options are impressive. I look forward to continuing on! Definitely recommend!"
5,Shellymbest,I have always been into finding out more and challenging myself to stimulate my brain. I love learning new things. But sometime I just like to do things that help me to think without having to have emotion tied to it. This app is great!! You‚Äôll enjoy it too!!
5,BlueEyedBritt,"I have the free version and love it so much I might actually spend some money on this one! I love the way it makes me challenge myself and I can see my results! I‚Äôm not really competing with another person, just bettering myself without the pressure! üôÇ"
5,SnowflakeVT,"Find that these games, exercise different parts of my brain than the typical games that I have downloaded. So far these are short games easy to understand and I get quick feedback."
5,ninesacrifices,I started using impulse and absolutely love the challenging games I play. I have even allowed my son to try and he does extremely well and it keeps him focused in a good way. We do this together and it‚Äôs a fun part of our day to look forward to!!
5,Big JMC Daddy,This is an outstanding training app for brain like mine which are aging but still need to stay sharp. I‚Äôve noticed a difference quickly with how sharp my brain is since starting this training
5,Baddietykierra,I like it because you will have something to do when your mom tell you to do some work. You will have something to do when you bored if you trying to do a pop quiz on your brain
5,b_b_~_~,"You do have to pay like a fee like if you actually want to go continuously keep improving. I mean if your paying money on it might as well play it. This game actually makes me feel very smart, and knowing I can do it(:"
4,danebodmer,It‚Äôs awesome to be able to just hop on and keep my mind sharp. The games are interesting and at such a high variety. There is many different options depending on which brain function you need most. How interactive this app truly is puts it so much higher than many in my mind!
5,Jojo2012321,"I got this game yesterday and I‚Äôm already in love!!! It is a really fun brain training game, and it‚Äôs not like those other games that your parents would complain about you playing! Because you‚Äôre using your mind to play these games!"
5,Hitori_Samishiku,"occasionally freezes right after I complete a game. I have to restart the app to bypass it. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a nice app with nice games. Not sure if I would pay a subscription though.  Edit: Now seems to work good and more reliable to play!"
2,Rissdyan,"I have two different brain injury's. This last year has been a complete fog. I am using impulse to see where my cognitive deficits are and to help retrain my brain. I do very short sessions for now, I can feel the brain fatigue pretty quickly.  I enjoyed the free trial. Canceled and deleted app but was still charged $40 with no way to get a refund. I guess be very careful when the trial runs out. A lot of nothing for an app I don't have."
3,homewiththehoopers,I have really been enjoying this app and due to budget was using the free version. The adds started off fine and then one came up that HIGHLY inappropriate and sexual in nature. Thank goodness I was playing and not my children. I am extremely disappointed that an app rated for 4+ and to exercise your brain would show such deplorable ads.
5,CraftyBee2020,Feel like I‚Äôm doing something more useful than scrolling media. I love the puzzles and I‚Äôm learning my memory is better than I thought. No complaints about this app at all! Was only going to do the free trial but definitely decided to keep it.
1,gtangjr,"The app recommends you stay off social media, but it's designed in every way to be the most aggressive, misleading, disgusting dopamine drip possible. This app does nothing for your brain. All it does is give them more and more information about how to manipulate you into playing longer and paying more. You want to train your brain? Try reading a book without giving up in two minutes to check your phone for more easy wins."
5,jay ferriss,"I wish they unlocked more games with out having to pay but other than that it‚Äôs fun and involves learning, would be great for kids if you don‚Äôt fully like them on video games but still like this kind of stuff"
5,Tessellation68,"It is always a good practice to challenge your brain to improve its function. These games do just that. They start you out at a training level and slowly increase in difficulty as you play. Perfect for people, like me, who aren‚Äôt gamers."
5,tessakchick,And it can be a 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è in your life too! If your like me which we are all more alike than you and I may know üåéü´∂üèº starving for more clarity and memory space for our üß† then this app is a MUST HAVE! props to the makers of this wonderful and very time worthy app üëèüèºü•≥üí™üèº
5,Nickname_is_taken_831,You ever download a game but it‚Äôs not what you expected because the ad was completely click bate. Well no need to worry these puzzles will make you think or help you relax with many different types of moods to choose from to suit how your feeling
5,Camille_teofila,Definitely helps with the recent memory loss I‚Äôve started having. the Dr suggested it to exercise the brain muscles and I‚Äôve had fewer moments of memory loss. I will say I get a headache after playing certain skills but I think that‚Äôs a good thing lol.
5,blissfulmorning,I love impulse because it makes me feel relaxed and productive at the same time. I like being able to see my improvement in areas and it helps me have fun with my competitive side (just competing against myself). I also love that impulse has personality tests!
5,blimblimblizzard123,On a whim I decided to give impulse a try! I‚Äôm 38 and feel like my brain could definitely use ‚Äú an oil change‚Äù lol. I haven‚Äôt been doing it very long yet but I find the games to be challenging but also fun and I keep going back to play on my free time..so glad I gave it a try!
5,Woo$,"It help‚Äôs your brain keep moving. As we get older, and things slow down, how fast you run, heal, and move around all together. Your mind will be the only thing moving at the speed if not faster all because of impulse"
5,StaceyyyRanaaaaaa,This app has helped me improve my memory (so far) & I suffer from memory loss from being a kid & some man put muscle relaxers in my soda that cause me many many problems related to my memoryüòîso if you‚Äôre looking for a app to help you gain your memory back slowly this IS the app for YOUüôåüëçüëè
5,lunaglo,I find myself waiting in line for my children at school for long periods of time‚Äî I have started using that time to engage my brain and electrify synapses that haven‚Äôt been electrified  in years. I used to listen to my murder podcasts - it‚Äôs a nice switch.
5,LilMama 042205,It was recommended that I do some Nuroplasticity (rewiring the brain) so I decided to look up some brain games to help me. This is literally my only seconded day doing it definitely can see all my weaknesses but truly believe if you stay committed-good things can happen
5,marleyhoo,These games are a fun way to give your brain a little exercise. I like the way they increase in challenge as you go. They only downside is the advertisements that slow down the game. I do recommend this to anyone!
4,ShaNiya is the star,I love this game but there is one problem there are so many ads. I also think they should make the question go to 10 instead of 5 or 7 or whatever. I absolutely love this it‚Äôs so fun to play I would like them to add something where you could compete against someone but the game is very cool!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Darjae the Don,"Wanted to do a free trial to see if it would help me learn about myself and help me improve a little.. mental health is the reason I‚Äôm personally downloading this , to seek interludes of help between therapy ; it seemed interesting. With the games a bit. But then I took an almos t 100 question quiz and in the end instead of getting the results , it got an add saying to unlock my results I needed to pay for the full app before cthey gave me the results. Quite disappointing and frustrating."
5,Annieruthlillieann,"I love this app for the variety of practice exercises, tests, and more. It‚Äôs a fun app, but it also helps you focus, concentrate, and work on your memory. I highly recommend it. It is intelligent and well thought out."
5,fluer-de-li,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed the challenges thus far from Impulse. My memory is exercised in a way that makes it entertaining for me. I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to grow bored, which is a huge plus. I wish I had played sooner. Great game!"
5,HopelessRomntc69,"It sharpens you for sure. I had my doubts but after using it for a day I saw how quickly my brain was able to connect things a lot faster and, I already thought I was pretty fast, who knew lol."
5,Anagramita,"I enjoy the variety of activities and believe they are keeping my intellect sharp.  I‚Äôm 65 and I think it is beneficial to do these activities every day.  I chose the one-and-done fee, rather than monthly or yearly billing, and I think that was a good decision."
1,TimofeyKl,"The number of shady and manipulative techniques this uses to have you spend money is unbelievable. It gathers all of the information, makes you complete the test only to tell you that unless you buy it, we won't show you the results. This is frustrating, and I feel like you're just robbing me.  At least be upfront about the fact that you can only access the results when you pay."
5,Rpr6-2-3,Your brain needs exercise just like the rest of your body but it improves faster with small & varied sessions instead of massive powerlifting type. This app makes it easy to help keep those cognitive functions on point.
5,Zombie otis,What would you doing on your phone otherwise? I love this app. I use it a few times a day when I have a moment. It feel better than doomscrolling social media.
5,CNEECE,This app is by far the most well out together Brain app out there. I have been struggling to not only find a great app but one that will challenge me every step of the way! Thank you for the details put into this!
5,Crystal & Jordan üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®,"I love the games in this app because they are well rounded and intriguing. Math, reading, patterns, memory, and articulation done in a fun and engaging way. My absolute favorite is the color sort tube game. I definitely recommend to have a fun challenge and revisit forgotten knowledge."
5,Aloe and Mena,Best brain game due to the fact there is a variety of different skill sets involved. If you are weak in one area you can keep going back to that area and build your skills up. Great all around family game
2,knumbskull721,"It‚Äôs a fun app and the ads don‚Äôt bother me much. The ads can get annoying on occasion, but what‚Äôs worse is the fact that you can‚Äôt get your results to the tests unless you pay. The tests is why I initially downloaded this app, but I can‚Äôt even see my results without paying, which I‚Äôm not. The games are fun and I enjoy the tracking, but this is unnecessary and annoying."
5,Ryan Tamula,Impulse is a great app for anyone that‚Äôs on the girl. I have a busy schedule and spend a lot of screen time. This app allows me to do quick brain exercises to keep me sharp and continue to elevate my game. Strong mind. Strong Mind. Strong Spirit.
5,This Nana Rocks,At 62 you do notice that you‚Äôre starting to not remember as quick as you used to and games like this by playing them. I‚Äôve noticed that my memory is coming back and I am getting faster at responding.
4,BookNookMomma,"Some brain building apps are expensive and honestly loose interest for me to want to keep going and end up deleting it  This one is fun, interesting, and keeps me wanting to play more and cNt wait to see how much of a difference it will help me with the longer I play over time!"
1,OhItsMissa,"Got recommended by a Instagram. Didn‚Äôt want to fully commit without trying the app first. Signed up for the free trial, if I liked it would have bought it for the year. Tried one personality quiz, not able see results without paying the yearly rate, declined then offered to get report for $4.99. What‚Äôs the point of the feee trial if you can‚Äôt access the results. Save your money! Bait and switch tactics are off putting."
5,Emi-rella,"Been looking for something to distress from work, but also keep my mind sharp. Also have been looking for something to help my dad‚Äôs memory and think this one is worthwhile for anyone with onset memory struggles."
2,DistantCry_,"If you‚Äôve used duolingo, imagine that system of ad placements but worse. Closing ads is awkward and once you think you‚Äôve closed it, its serves you an interactive ad of the same game, and now you have to close that one. The memory games are fun, but the devs are crazy if they think this amount of ads is acceptable. I would rather them paywall most of the content. Instant uninstall."
5,fullname here,"So Wifey was struttin‚Äô around the house one day and changin clothes quicker than a chameleon changes color. So I asked her, ‚Äúbabe, where I buyin‚Äô all these clothes from?‚Äù  She was like, ‚ÄúI just buy them on impulse, okay!‚Äù  So I downloaded this app and I still don‚Äôt where the Add To Cart button is."
5,RandisDandi,I‚Äôve only been playing for a couple days so from what I‚Äôve played today it‚Äôs been all right. I think I‚Äôm going to like it so I can‚Äôt really give you a true review because I haven‚Äôt played it that long but so far so good I like.
5,ruchellib,"I am loving Impulse as I feel a lot smarter using my time training my brain vs on instagram üôÉ. I feel that sometimes we open instagram just to spend time, as we‚Äôre used to it, and now I do Impulse instead!"
5,Laiken#The1&Only,It really makes you pay attention and be aware of your surroundings and aware of other senses that could be and are helping you at the time but you never stop & realize it.  This game helps you recognize plus strengthen it.
5,Adam TX Boater,I like this app because it offers quick improvements to mental intelligence. I‚Äôve been looking for an app to help train my memory and become quicker to thought - I think I found it!
5,Jayboogie2k23,It does increase your anxiety levels because very thing is timed to complete certain task. If it wasn‚Äôt timed in the beginning from the onset then it would be something to get use to. But overall I do recommend it!
4,Saavy Chica!,"Great game, I noticed the more than I played it the faster I became. I can definitely see how it would be beneficial in helping to recognize patterns faster and with more accuracy which is critical throughout the business day for any professional. Speed and accuracy is the name of the game!"
5,Dominic080806,It is a neat app to keep your Bain working through the day. Also It offers many ways to do. I would recommend trying it just to see if it can help you focus or whatever your trying to improve
5,new2LetGo,This app has definitely given me a way exercise my Brain on a daily basis!!! I love seeing myself improve and challenge myself!! It definitely makes me feel accomplished and is much better than watching hours of television !!!!!
5,Alwan777,"I like this app because it makes me sharp by showing me my weak points and allowing me to work on skills to enhance them. There are different tests that can reveal your strengths and traits and many different exercises to enhance your brain mathematically, logically, and linguistically. Thank you."
5,Scottish Julie,I am recovering from encephalitis of the brain and have lots of therapists and appointments. I have been encouraged to play games do puzzles to exercise my brain. I have shown this application to my cognitive therapist and she gives it five stars. I‚Äôll give it five stars because I enjoy it.
5,ItsPJCdude,"I never leave these, but I feel compelled to by this awesome app. It‚Äôs paced perfectly to train the mind from fun & simple to difficult & challenging. The great thing about Impulse is that by the time you get to the super challenging parts, you‚Äôre well prepared. I love this app!"
5,sarabeeee77,"I am always busy, but it‚Äôs super easy to use this app to taken even just 10 minutes out of my day to sharpen my brain. I‚Äôve been struggling with brain fog and memory, so I‚Äôm very excited to see my improvement over time."
5,Macfavor,I definitely am getting into the games. They are fun and I can see how they help with my focus my concentration in my memory. I‚Äôve only use this for a couple of days I look forward to doing another review sometime down the road.
4,SOFIAAAAüòÇ,This game is really good for when bored I give it 4 starts Bc u can‚Äôt unlock anything so far I played for a long time now and I haven‚Äôt u locked anything I love the way it doesn‚Äôt give u all lot of adds but the game are pretty challenging I would recommend if u don‚Äôt have a game that entertains ur brain the game keeps u r brain active ‚Ä¶ok bye
5,Ju¬ßt‚âàƒØ√ßƒô,"I‚Äôm not really into games, but I loooove all the progresses my brain. My enjoyment probably comes from my loves for brain expansion and progression, but over time this could really help you out mentally. I didn‚Äôt realize they made games for that type of thing, but I‚Äôm sooo happy I do now!"
5,Amy Lynette,I look forward to my daily challenges on the Impulse app. I love that I get challenged in different topics and there are so many more topics that i can challenge myself with! I definitely recommend this app to everyone that wants brain twisters!
2,Lucasm123,"I had understood the subscription was $9.99/month; it is in fact $9.99 per WEEK. Which is ridiculous! This is a quality and fun way to spend your free time playing useful brain games to train your mind, but there are significantly cheaper alternatives than essentially $40 a month, If you‚Äôre paying weekly. Again, it‚Äôs a good app, but way too costly and I had thought I was paying for a monthly subscription of $9.99, not a weekly one. Ouch."
5,Super chick 180,"I use it to take a break and I felt like I was using my brain, instead of doom scrolling. I eventually bought it because I hate advertising always happening between games. But I use it once I day so to me it was worth it."
5,HopeLyon77,I really like this app. The challenges are short enough you can do them in a few minutes whenever you have a spare minute of boredom. I also like the longer ones like the personality test.
5,Anna_Wake,I like being on my phone but scrolling on social medias isn‚Äôt always entertaining. These games are fun and entertaining. I‚Äôm not a big phone game fan but I spend a good bit of time playing these
5,Tori_mcshorty98,I‚Äôve always wanted to improve my memory and other skills. I used to be an alcoholic. I‚Äôve only tried this for a couple days and already feel like I‚Äôm doing better. Simple to use.
5,Jbar9203,I have had so much chemo my brain just doesn't function as clearly as I want it to. These brain games are not only fun I feel they are what I need to sharpen my memory and help me regain confidence to feel like me again!!! I highly Recommend!!!
3,J.R. 102216,"Impulse isn‚Äôt my favorite brain training app, but it‚Äôs still good. I believe it focuses more on memory and response, but it‚Äôs a simple practice to insert into your daily routine. And I received a great lifetime deal as well. The only real issue I‚Äôve had is the app ‚Äúrestoring my progress‚Äù and deleting my daily streak. I‚Äôve attempted to contact customer service, but have received no reply."
5,goernerv,I‚Äôve been using Impulse for about a year. It is quick and easy to fit into my day. I will definitely continue to use the app and tell my  friends and family!
5,Annoyed2011,So I‚Äôm a school girl and I love challenging my brain to higher standards. impulse helps me with that there are three puzzle/games that it recommends for you a day they are fun and challenging. And you can do tests games and so much more to make your brain think better and faster.
5,Nanof9üíó,"It‚Äôs good to train your brain to different stimuli. The games seem easy ,but using skills you don‚Äôt typically use everyday is fun to see how fast you can react . Test your brain ,challenge your accuracy and speed. And have fun ."
5,NateJain,"I‚Äôm constantly looking for good ways to relax and give my head a break. This app really does let me take a break from life, while also giving me something fun to put some effort into."
5,Jennf1,"After a concussion and TBI, this game has helped me tremendously! I had to start out very simple and work my way up. After reviewing it with my concussion therapist, she actually recommended continuing daily within my screen time limitations."
2,MaddenIsRllyBadd,I am truly upset. I just took a 60 question in test which I thought was fee but nope! At the end of the test it made me have to pick a payment option just to see my score Like at least instead of making people waste their time for something they have to pay for at the end at least let them know they have to pay for it before hand.
5,mjsmh,Everyone says just start by starting with a task or journey that seems full of mountains - I‚Äôm grateful to have found something that‚Äôs quick and helpful while also EXTREMELY informative .. thank you impulse app!
1,Grenouille192,"Locking someone‚Äôs IQ test report and trauma test report behind a paywall is so screwed up. And yes, I know it shows the basic results without payment. But if this app were really trying to help people work towards self improvement it wouldn‚Äôt keep most of the info you needed to help yourself from you. Also, for anyone looking for fun brain games, there are hundreds of other apps with the same games for free. Seriously, don‚Äôt get roped into paying for this app."
5,nay-nay2010,I‚Äôve enjoyed the fun and challenging brain games. This app has each game can be so different or require a different skill set. It does cost money but could be handy. If it‚Äôs some thing you‚Äôre looking for to challenge yourself.
2,BookishBeauty,"Far too many ads on the free version. At the start of the game, at the end, in between levels. It‚Äôs constant. And premium is so pricey. $6.99/week?? That‚Äôs $28/month. We‚Äôre not the 1%. We don‚Äôt have $28/month to spend on a phone app üôÑ The lifetime price isn‚Äôt so bad but it doesn‚Äôt look like the app is updated with new games/levels often so I‚Äôm still not convinced it‚Äôs worth it."
4,jajajajjajajajajajajja,There tests say there gonna tell you all this information about you had my answer 40 questions then just told me one of the things and said I had to pay for the rest of the report very disappointing
5,cknngt__MaStEr,I love this game so much!!! I first was upset at the amount of money you have to pay but I got the 92% off discount!!! I only have to pay 26 dollars a year. This game is so fun and you should download it too. It has so many fun games and I feel as if it‚Äôs sharpened my mind already.
5,Jazbdkskdksj,Great app you can still play games on it without buying and it fun while still training your brain I do recommend buying because you get a lot more access and you can see your details.
4,Nikula0567,They actually include an IQ test which I don‚Äôt think should be a sales gimmick. I think there should be a placement evaluation or analysis of some sort because I‚Äôm not compete if with everyone else. My current cognitive status is weaker than it used to be. Idk that the app understands that. Otherwise I luv it!!!!
5,deepseaxXiren,Really great way to spend down time instead of scrolling through social apps for hours! I can really feel my brain getting sharper after each exercise.
5,Keasha001,Why I say this is that I actually enjoy this because they have multiple games to help your brain kind regenerate and you play 3 games for your daily play it‚Äôs really fun good games so definitely recommend to buy this!ü§≠
5,Sundayracer,Please update with new (different) games. Love the games and variety. I paid for the yearly fee. Though once getting passed the 80 plus levels they are getting boring.  Please develop different games.  Thanks.
5,Anonymous xxoox,This game is awesome!!Its so fun and that you have the option of several different types of games it‚Äôs so cool! I love this game so much especially because I travel a lot and this is an offline game so I use it all the time! It‚Äôs also a really good stress/anxiety reliever app!!
5,Mi amor‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö,Impulse is a really amazing app with wonderful game that are fun but still stimulates my brain and with the daily reminders I can not worry about forgetting about it and instead just see the reminder and play wonderful games that give me a fun break but still keep me focused
5,Sol_amaro,"I‚Äôm not fully confident in the math sections, so this will definitely help me improve and refresh any basic math I‚Äôve forgotten. If you are worried about the math section don‚Äôt worry they have other games and puzzles to choose from."
5,meoooooowz,I really like having this app on my phone. the games are fun and every time I reach for my phone out of habit I just open this app instead of spending more time on social media.  I think the cost was worth it.
5,Dc4misty,I‚Äôm almost 50. My brain has been feeling like mush a lot these days. I teach 5 year olds all day. It‚Äôs challenging work don‚Äôt get me wrong but not intellectually if that makes sense. This app is helping me to unwind and my brain feels like it‚Äôs getting a massage! Honestly!
4,only1me,"When you take a moment for yourself to keep growing with Impulse, you‚Äôll find yourself on a mission to overcome the little challenges in a fun way! Quick lil games & quest for mastery keeps your brain sharp; you don‚Äôt become mush, complacent, or overindulged with endless entrapments of video games.  4 stars is for cost $$$"
5,emmbum,"I love the way they help to exercise the brain in cute little fun ways. They do so well with categorizing. Highly recommend the daily exercises. You may not do fantastic but at least you participated. Anyone can do it and they help explain the math puzzles, too."
5,yvarzideh26,I love waking up and doing my ‚Äúdaily exercises‚Äù. It keeps my focus attention and cognition sharp while also waking me up and being fun too! There are many types of games and many levels. It knows what I need and I love that!
5,lauren endall,"Definitely keeps the brain working and helps your memory, along with even having the ability to make you smarter in ALL aspects. I got lucky and won a 92% off for a yearly plan so I‚Äôm only paying around $2.3 per month. Amazing"
5,cbsitruc,"Being consistent and doing a few games a day helps me stay sharp and is improving quick recall, in head math and my memory, which has really need a pick me up. This game is fun and very helpful. I enjoy it but most importantly it helps!"
5,dividt,"Highly recommended! It highly increased my focus and memory. I used to get distracted so easily during class and never retain information, but after using the app memory had drastically change along with focus too."
5,R00$TER,"Very exciting, challenging but still possible to accomplish. Helping me as I find myself out of reach of my studies with applying myself to achieve an eligible score to be accepted into the AirForce. Thank you! to the creators and investors who made this App possible for everyday Humans such as myself :)  Mahalo Nui from Maui!"
5,Faster cars = more fun,"I had COVID last November, and since, I just felt lke my brain wouldn‚Äôt compute like it did before. After a few days of this game, I can actually feel my brain coming back online. I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúbrain games‚Äù, but this one is by far the best!"
5,Leadfist72,"Definitely helps me sharpen my mind instead of watching some kind of ‚Äúporn‚Äù be it pornography (ü§Æ), car-porn, food-porn, then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúclips‚Äù & shorts that waste so much time with no added benefit!!! If your gonna ‚Äúwaste time‚Äù, ‚Äúwaste it on something worthwhile‚Äù!!‚Ä¶"
5,55Lizzie55,This app is amazing because it allows you to learn while having fun doing it. I also like the fact that it gives you free games to play in the meantime while waiting for the daily lesson. Thank you for making this app!!
4,bjffxx,"If you want to test your capabilities it‚Äôs a fun app to try. It‚Äôs only annoying at times when you have to pay to unlock all the good features. Although, it‚Äôs pretty good compared to other apps I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs my third day of playing and I enjoy the time I spend."
3,Amy J. MacBook Pro,"Before I start : Dunninger-Kruger Effect. Okay, I‚Äôm 48. I know how to use a phone. Seriously, do you (developers) think I‚Äôll actually pay to use an app with a free trial? By the by‚Ä¶ if there wasn‚Äôt a free trial (just a paid app), I totally wouldn‚Äôt download it. Also - as I‚Äôm 48 and have known my IQ since I was roughly 10, it was (186). We do lose IQ points as we age. Based on recent tests, I stand at 164. So‚Ä¶ yeah."
5,GinaQ789,I absolutely love this game. The levels of intensity are incredible. It‚Äôs like warm ups for your brain as each level gets more intense. I am amazed at what I thought I couldn‚Äôt remember. Definitely a keeper and definitely will continue playing.
5,CutthroatEtta,"Impulse is fun because the games take you through levels that increase in difficulty, which also makes it challenging. There are sooo many different types of games as well."
5,rpt 361,I love this game it keeps my brain going and I love that it shows you how to play at the same time I wish h in could afford this game to play more often thanks guys for letting me play for free while it lasted I would definitely encourage more players to come and play
1,Minicoop-33,This app allows you to get a 3 day free trial and then you will be charged $7 per week after that. $7 per week is insanely overpriced for what this app is and likely makes loads of money from people who either forget to cancel after the trial or from kids that accept the subscription and then the parents are charged until they notice the charge. Quit being a shady company and charging hundreds of dollars per year for a weekly subscription.
4,O-Sandoval,The game is fun to play just hate having to deal with ads every two rounds I‚Äôm not the type of person to pay for no ads but if they could have a function where you watch a video to get rid of ads for ten minutes that would be amazingüëç
3,‚òÅÔ∏èEmmaphant‚òÅÔ∏è,"Great application for brain training, but I downloaded the app based on an advertisement about learning your trauma response. I wanted to learn more about flight, fight, freeze and fawn and which response I use personally. There are no tests regarding this or further information, disappointing.  When I tried to research how to access this in the app, I find no help."
5,navidawn,I was reluctant at first to pay the price but so glad I did!!  I look forward to the daily training and love all the additional training and activities.  Some make my brain hurt I guess that is a good thing!! üòä
4,Andy Kotz/ AKMusic Productions,"I‚Äôm having fun with this. Came in handy since lately (I‚Äôm 61), I‚Äôve been forgetting simple things. Not sure if it‚Äôs the meds I‚Äôm on or if it‚Äôs something worse. So I started to seek out challenges for my brain to keep my focus sharp. Too soon to tell if it‚Äôs working yet but this is a fun little app!"
1,Ang_Vinces,Well yeah... highly disappointed at the mischievous way they have of getting you tricked into BUYING this app. I can agree that it will trick your brain before it starts training it. The fact of being so used to ‚Äútapping for Apple ID‚Äù I tapped before I was even able to say no; I was able to read it was $4.99 weekly after the 3 day trial. Like no! I‚Äôm not paying $20 a month for a game. Then I looked everywhere on the settings and policies and you can‚Äôt even cancel it with one click... this is really upsetting.
1,Villafuerte4028,"Hi, I deleted this app because I had not been using it but I keep getting charged every week. I‚Äôve been charged twice now even after I deleted the app. Please refund me my money, I have tried to opt out of this subscription by going into the app settings but I have no option to opt out of paying for this app. Am I going to keep getting charged even after deleting this app? Please resolve this issue and process my refund. This app producer has been ignoring my emails. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!"
4,mbdekara,"It‚Äôs been nice to have these games and the ritual of playing them in my day. Some are better for my particular brain than others, but they all help absolve guilt about being on my phone and have saved me from going down news or nonsense rabbit holes!"
4,Kryss Lynnü§ç,"Hey there; ‚ù§Ô∏è       So to be completely honest‚Ä¶ I was pretty hesitant about downloading this app, and paying for it because I am really not a game lover at all.      Surprisingly! After I played a few games, I definitely got hooked, but I do feel its helpful for my brain and also keeps you pretty busy.  Plus, there‚Äôs so many different games to choose from in the app, so in my opinion, I would recommend this to anyone. It‚Äôs worth it.   I highly enjoy it!      I have even got my boyfriend to download the APP  and we sit in bed each playing our ‚Äòfavorite‚Äô game.    -Kryss‚ù£Ô∏è"
5,JefSQ,"Just started and enjoyed the first game.  Short and quick exercises that are both entertaining and beneficial in keeping me quick and accurate, where we often fall in to a routine lifestyle"
5,bsasam.echo,Would have to say it is definitely something I would say is children safe so far and is quite entertaining rather than watching tiktok keeps my brain from feeling like I‚Äôm suffocating from boredom.
5,nyabugg,It‚Äôs a cute little app and i like that they let me play some games even when im not a paying customer. I‚Äôm really broke but I wanted my studies to go better than they are now and I just started this so I really hope it helps üò≠
5,QueenBee1st,Impulse is a great way to train your brain to make you even smarter than you already years. I love impulse because it teaches you and there‚Äôs fun games on there like drawing online. That‚Äôs my favorite game and it is really fun. Try this app because you will love it.
5,ABEE42,"My brain needs exercise, and this seems to be the way to get it. The game is very colorful and stimulating. That way it encourages you to think fast which I need to do it helps you remember things which is what I am the worst at."
5,NutMeg2.0,These brain games are actually quite fun.  Most brain games can be a bit boring but these I e never really played before  I would most definitely recommend this game to my family and friends
5,kellycidaho,"Have played before and this is my second time using this app. It‚Äôs been improved and I like it better than I did before. Games make you think and at my age, that‚Äôs a good thing!"
5,dlaray,"This app is truly helping me come out of a state of confusion, bringing back to the light ( being in the know ) with information that makes things so clear. I love this app. You should definitely download it. You will not regret it."
5,Diana Moshier,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I took the test and started each exercise! I was worried about the difficulty and honestly, I‚Äôm very happy with the creativeness in which the tests appear. Each day poses another creative challenge! Love it!"
3,Huzaraan,I can‚Äôt pay for it I can‚Äôt afford it I‚Äôm not in a position to pay for it and I really want to continue playing it. I mean I can bury with the ads but paying for it it‚Äôs hard not everyone can‚Äôt afford pay for it so maybe you wanna look at it because I don‚Äôt have money at all to pay for this and I really enjoy this
5,Cj Oneally,This has been a great app so far. I feel like it‚Äôs enabled me to tap into a whole Nother level of my cognitive skills my senses seem sharper my thoughts quicker. Now if I can just get my vocabulary and reading up to speed.üòÅ
5,Qwert.io,"I just started playing it and it is pretty fun. Although I am still at the beginning so everything is still very easy. I don‚Äôt know if the game changes in the future, hopefully it gets harder."
5,Petiedro,This is actually an amazing app. Love learning and learning more about myself. Then to do daily quizzes to improve my brain. Absolutely enjoying this app and cannot wait to see my hard change me from the inside out.
5,WarStorm-Sterben,"It cost money, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it. Its definitely good for keeping the brain sharp, and it‚Äôs a healthy way to pass time when you‚Äôre bored or just before you get ready for bed."
5,JQMort1,"Playing games, whoever thought this simple thing could improve your mental health. I‚Äôm addicted!! So much I don‚Äôt even think about training my brain. So many different activities that you never get bored. 5 stars is not enough!!"
5,fergiegirl13,"These games are perfect for enhancing my focus which is why I chose it. I can tell depending on the time of day, my mood, and even whether on an empty stomach or not how well I score or how bad I score. I will definitely continue to play with focus! Love the games‚Ä¶"
5,1JPWise$,Impulse is an excellent way to keep you mind eyes and focus sharp. Just a few minutes everyday can enhance one‚Äôs ability to process information and respond much quicker than your average person
5,Rosewb,I have Parkinson‚Äôs disease and I‚Äôm trying not to develop the dementia that 60% of PD patients get. This app is definitely helping me stay mentally stable and healthy. I am enjoying the process with Impulse. I will continue to use the app for assisting me for the rest of my life . Thank you! Liz Walters‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
5,Gud41mo,This is the very first game I‚Äôve played that I can actually feel my brain working. I also like that it tells you the percentage of people you beat and the intensity of each level you gain. Great Game!
5,popstarbunny,I used the free trial of this app and instantly fell in love with the variety of options and genuinely fun brain-engaging games. The personality test was spot-on and my roommates even thought it was extremely accurate. They do offer discount awards if you try it by just using the app!
5,WhySoDificult!,"Some people read üìï to stay sharp. ü•± Try playing games throughout the day ü§îüòè, THEN wind down with a good üìï. ü´†üõåüí§ You‚Äôd have a more productive day! Unless people ASSume that you‚Äôre SIMPLY playing on your phone rather than üßê WISELY playing on your phone."
5,haylie rye,It is something that has me up in them printing ready to play before I have to get ready for school it makes me feel accomplished I just with it was free to feel even better
5,CelluliteSale,It‚Äôs hard to keep your brain on your toes when you‚Äôre not in school and a learning little facts here and there are good but not a good alternatives.   This helps me a lot and reminds me of when I used to use another app like this.
5,saivon7,Instead of scrolling on Facebook I use impulse to fill in my free time. I think it‚Äôs 100% worth the download and just to prove my appreciation for it I purchased a year subscription after getting 29% off from a mini game.
1,YaTTaBai,I just gave you $6.99 for a week‚Äôs subscription then you make me pay $6.99 MORE just to see my IQ score?? What‚Äôs the deal here? My head hurts because I did all that work for absolutely nothing but more begging from you guys. At least 50% of people download this app in the first place because they‚Äôre bored or sad‚Ä¶obviously digging in our pockets every other test/game is off-putting. I‚Äôm appalled. I knew there hard to be a good reason I deleted this app long ago.
5,Hair2DayGone2Morrow,I‚Äôm 51 usually pretty sharp but since Covid my processing has gotten foggy. Originally thought this app was childish until I realized it actually makes you obviously think  and process unlike other video games.
1,JakeOnHisPhone,"They advertise quizzes but at every turn they want you to get their craziest newest deal for their yearly subscription. You will then find you can‚Äôt even take the quizzes even if your subscribe with a free trial  For an app that is designed to help cope and mitigate the symptoms of ADHD, seems like this app is intentionally capitalizing on its weaknesses. For example they give you shining present animations with newer deals, and when you try to reject it the App guilts you.  This is absolutely a psychological ploy to give you a burst of dopamine and then fear of missing out, and take money from those who may have poor impulse control.  Honestly disgusting, what the business is doing with this app isn‚Äôt just bad, it‚Äôs actively malicious."
5,Jinx.green,Honestly I don't really like most mind games because of adds or because they don't really make you use your brain. But this game calms me when I'm feeling down and makes my brain feel refreshed.
5,xxkebexx,I like being able to strengthen my brain even when I‚Äôm busy working and doing school work. It‚Äôs fast and not very time consuming. My family has a history of dementia so I‚Äôm hoping this will help prevent me from developing it.
5,Co-Pilot85,I feel like it‚Äôs at least 90% accurate. I answer quickly when taking the test and I feel that helps. I training games are entertaining to me. I have an analytical mind and this is very interesting.
5,jendecide,"There‚Äôs so many different mini games that target different weaknesses you might have, honestly at this point I don‚Äôt care if it helps with cognitive development, it‚Äôs a really fun and colorful game I‚Äôll probably be stuck playing forever."
1,807777753541,Stupid garbage app that steals money 7$ a week doesn‚Äôt say anything so pointless if you feel the need to throw your money away then power to you. this app gives you a ‚Äúbetter brain‚Äù and yet purchasing it for 7 dollars a week 28 dollars a month is possibly the stupidest decision you could make. Maybe Read a book instead of doing stupid mini games to ‚Äúbetter your brain‚Äù. This app has been bankrupting me secretly and draining my card EVERY WEEK.
5,JESUS LOVER #1 FAN,Impulse is I good game especially for elementary kids. It‚Äôs helps them learn and have fun while doing it. And they are timed with everything so it really makes it challenging but fun at the same time. I recommend any parents with little kids to use impulse. K-6
5,_silentprincess,"Impulse is so relaxing and I really mean it. Without paying a thing you can play so many of their stress relieving, brain sharpening games such as candy sorting, worlds, word searches, and the every day excersizes are so extremely fun. Definitely recommend this game :)"
5,wheres my timex,I like the challenge of making my brain work instead of sitting watching the tv. I‚Äôm glad my daughter told me about it. I‚Äôve been depressed over some medical issues and this is somewhere positive to put my energy.
5,J.Joanne,"I like the different features like brain games, puzzles, quizzes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just a few games but a whole lot more. I also like that it shows how you rank in comparison to your age group in terms of the games."
5,Olive Oil 793,"We tend to take care of our skin, hair, internal body but we tend to forget about our minds. My mind will be healthier this year because of the exercises Impulse will throw at me. Do yourself and your mind a favor‚Ä¶..download impulse. You will be glad you did."
5,CJM077007,"Love this app. It really helps when I‚Äôm relaxing. Fun, helpful, educational, and cool. Highly recommend this app for children-adults. Thank me later. Not many ads if any at all. If you older you just want play a game and not feel childish or judged for it this is the app."
5,Averyboyer,This game is amazing it helps take me out of my funk and unfogs my brain and helps refresh my mind and I especially love that it‚Äôs free! I might get the upgraded service when I can afford it but developers keep it up you‚Äôre doing an amazing job
5,xolinamusicox,I enjoy using impulse because the games are fun while also giving me a chance to test my knowledge and keep my brain engaged. It‚Äôs a better way for me to start my phone use for the day then scrolling on social media
5,mmdrys,I really like the games they challenge me and works my memory as well because I am getting older and I want to do these games before I learn my new language on Babbel. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to keep my brain active at my age.
1,GS-home,"I had to type this on the note app then paste the text because it will not allow me to type properly since I‚Äôm giving it only 1 star.   This is aggressive in making sure they receive 5 stars, as I was playing the game it asked me to review the app and would not allow me to close the popup review button, I literally had to close the app. A complete cheap scam! Would not recommend!! Honestly doesn‚Äôt even deserve 1 star for the crappy games!"
5,plnmnm1,By far the best spring training app that I‚Äôve tried. I especially like the example so there‚Äôs no confusion about what you need to do for each game. Highly recommend. Could improve the pricing however.
5,Kahdajah,I wanted something that‚Äôll keep me interested and help me improve my overall brain machine lol. It‚Äôs definitely helps me figure out the things I‚Äôm good at and the things I need to work on. And the ads aren‚Äôt annoying.
5,StormiLadie,Really makes you think and helps quicker decisions. Not boring or slow just wish it could give you some on-site on your way of thinking by how you answer and what you get right
5,Afizzzzlesizkh,"App is very visually appealing and engaging. I love the games and the opportunities to give feedback, it makes me feel like they take the feedback seriously and want to make continuous improvements. I was offered at 92% discount on a year subscription - would recommend!!"
5,TNicolette,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews. Ever. However!! This app is literally the best mind pleasing app lol. I find myself laughing in the middle of the games or I‚Äôll consider them different task‚Ä¶they become challenging but it‚Äôs a very pleasing challenging. Words can‚Äôt describe enough, try it out."
1,Shpage,"I downloaded Impulse last night and finally sat down to work on the games this morning. I chose to go the free route. Upon choosing the game you want to play, you‚Äôre required to watch an ad. That‚Äôs fine with me, seeing as it‚Äôs free, but I was never able to get past the ad. It would freeze every time. I tried closing the app and opening again several times, and even tried opening a different game. Same results. I‚Äôll stick with the other apps that work better."
5,Ieydhdjsowidjxh,"The games you play are actually set up for YOUR levels in how you do, and works to build you up from there. It‚Äôs very fun to play, and actually helps you build the skills it says it‚Äôll help you with. 5 stars!"
2,NT Preds fan,"Many issues since the recent update. Every single time it takes multiple attempts to get the app to actually open and today, after 10 tries I gave up. Recently when I have been able to get the app to open, I do the three games and then it keeps repeating them.  Update: Issue seems to be resolved."
5,brother nico,I love this app and all the little mini games it has but the ads can get kinda annoying and I know they need ads to keep the game going but like bro ads in the middle of my game is crazy
2,BaylorMom-9,"Please PLEASE fix the issue in Candy Sort.  There are levels I have completed, I finish the next level or two or more then randomly it‚Äôll take me back a few levels and want me to rework them. I enjoy Candy Sort. It is definitely one of my favorites, but I do not want to rework levels I have passed. For example: I am on level 799, but now it is wanting me to rework levels 795 and 797!"
2,AgeAngel,"I love this app! I‚Äôve been playing daily nonstop, my only issue it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs glitches and has reset my streak twice. The first one it did it at 24 days and now at 81 days. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but it‚Äôs a bit frustrating since the streak is a nice way to stay competitive and it gives you a nice daily challenge. I‚Äôve reached out to support but have gotten no response."
5,The cancer 6/30,I‚Äôm struggling with my memory & just being on point and today is the first day I played some of the activities and I feel improved. I feel like I can tell what I need to work on and what I‚Äôm good at. 10/10 recommend.
5,TBI worker,I love Impluse brain game because I am a brain injured person! These games really tax my brain and make me think!! They are sweet with their critiques too! I value being able to play games that are helping me with my disability at the same time! Thanks for this App!
5,CNG3731,"I am loving these games so far. It‚Äôs been a great stress reliever, helps me focus on the present and not allow my thoughts to roam or become negative. It has been helping with my anxiety and concentration. I highly recommend anyone of all ages to download this app!"
5,SassySari,"I enjoy working on these at any time of day, but especially during my break at work. When I start to feel tired, I check in, give my brain a quick stretch, and my mind feels energized. It‚Äôs the best."
3,Juggler~1,While I like this app I wish I could get larger text on several of the games. If the game has images it‚Äôs fine but if there is text I struggle to read at my normal speed because even with reading glasses on the font is too small. The app doesn‚Äôt support dynamic text size so it can‚Äôt be changed in settings
5,niszie,It‚Äôs a great game ! I was unable to focus for the past few weeks and this is surely helping . The games are designed very well and they‚Äôre not a repetitive pattern so the keep one engaged well in it ! Good app for sure and great for growing kids too.
5,debdeb11!,I can already tell how my brain is working on different games-It is almost like gaming for kids but not and it is a good coping skill to play to reduce stress. You can‚Äôt think about anything else when your looking for a pair to match lol
5,TJSell,Decent brain training app. It‚Äôs the first one I have ever used and it is very simple to use. It would be better if it didn‚Äôt have all the adds but I will deal with the adds and use the free version
5,adog126112,The program makes it fun since you see how you compare to the rest of the users who have tested.  It makes you want keep going to see how quick you can keep your brain reacting!
5,Chris0nTopOfHer,Love the mental challenges of everyday use! Really is designed for your needs and can be utilized to work every part of your brain all you need is between 5-20 mins a day for something challenging. Best suited for Critical thinking skills and analyzing situations. Awesome!
1,Nanami Ford,"It says 3 days free, so I agreed to pay whatever that was AFTER 3 days, and when I gave away all of my personal information and thoughts on the tests, it now asked me ‚Äúdo you wanna pay $30 to see the result?‚Äù, so I thought that was the part of 3 days free trail anyway, so I clicked yes and checked the results that I deserve.  Now they charged the $30, that means there is NO 3 days free trial. Very scam. Stay away. There are many phycological test like this FOR FREE."
4,Varun j,Impulse is a good game to play for any age groups  and intents on improving your brain impulse.  One thing was not clear on how the ratings are calculated and also based on the current rating it would he great if it has recommendations of other games to make your brain kore efficient.
5,deonBH,"Brain training app so far!  This app has IQ test, along with many other test. It has many kinds of training techniques as well and updates you along the way. Best part is you have fun while you‚Äôre doing it!"
5,quickrn04,"I have enjoyed this app so far. It has very interesting and varied games, as well as tests for different brain functions.  I will continue to use this app daily to keep improving my brain functions"
2,lms0419,"I could see this getting good when you move up to more challenging levels but the beginning ones are too easy, wish you could skip levels. For something so easy it‚Äôs not worth sitting through 30 second ads every minute or so to move onto the next level which isn‚Äôt very engaging, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll wait it out."
5,Gen720,I never found an app that genuinely feels like it‚Äôs training my brain all AND be enjoyable until this app! It has a variety of categories and mini puzzles/games to play from which is something I really love!
1,Demian64,Don‚Äôt fall for it. Can‚Äôt imagine how this is so highly rated. Doesn‚Äôt demonstrate any value. Only option is a ‚Äúlimited trial‚Äù that you know will wind up with a likely annual fee despite them giving monthly pricing. I tire of mental and physical fitness apps that don‚Äôt demonstrate value that are only using tried and true methods that prey on peoples inattention and busy lifestyles. PROVE your worth then ask for payment.
5,nikkismilea,"I‚Äôm netesd of crushing fruit you can make your brain sharper while waiting in the doctors office,.. or all those in between moments we‚Äôre all mindlessly crushing fruit! Love this game! I can feel the workout on my cognitive, LOVE IT!! Need more!"
5,Jstacy44,I like how it seems easy but I can also feel myself ‚Äúworking‚Äù to get the answers. So it feels like I‚Äôm really exercising my brain! It has helped me concentrate better at work and at church. I‚Äôm retaining information much better.
5,amreyes965,Starts simple and becomes more challenging each time. Great way to keep your mind sharp and focused! You can pick the type of problems you‚Äôd like to solve which I love compared to other brain games.
5,Widiurs,"Just started playing and am very impressed with the graphics, versatility and intuitive user interface. Prime example on how an app should be designed. Games are fun and offer enough difficulty levels even for the Einsteins (not me!!!)."
5,jasonmb2020,"I am not the play games on the phone person, but Impulse hooked me. Now I‚Äôm not bored on the phone when trying to find something to do. I just got right away into this app. Highly recommended."
1,TheKayWren,They claim it‚Äôs free but has in-app purchases but you can‚Äôt actually do anything in the app without agreeing to pay. There is a free trial period of 3 days that you have to go in and cancel manually. Then after trying out the app they offer you a subscription whose wording is not made clear that there is NO option for a refund.  I feel very duped and disappointed and do not feel like the games live up to the ad.
5,Fallen Dawn Swan,I think this is the best game in the world. I think that troubled teens that are depressed and play violent video games that simulate violent acts should play these games instead. Then they can become really smart or intelligent. Then they would be less likely to have school shootings.
5,Tiffanic3,I really love this type of training game.  I love that they show you your stats compared to others as well.  I like that it helps to keep the mind sharp.  Definitely a game you should check out for sure!!
5,Gabealorp,"I‚Äôm a pre med student currently, this helps me re focus after a long test or research paper and or gathering statistical data. I enjoy the puzzles along with the matching aspects. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to challenge/ help themselves."
5,jayelie,If you want to improve your focus memory problem solving  math or language in anyway you‚Äôll want this app believe meüíØü§åüèæüëçüèæüëåüèæüíØonly used for a month and I feel like I improved on a good amount of things already‚Ä¶
5,Johnny6590,"If you don‚Äôt have 10 minutes a day to keep yourself sharp with this great app you are not using all of your brain then. Keep your mind sharp, download this app and try and start using 100% of your brain üëåüèª"
5,^~gamerannie~^,"I think this game is great if you get stressed a lot! It‚Äôs like a fidget toy, it helps relieve your stress and it‚Äôs super fun and relaxing. It also helps you to increase some of your math skills and be able to answer math questions quicker! It‚Äôs a great game and go download it right now!!"
5,pretty healthy,I downloaded the app hoping that playing the games would improve my focus. I can‚Äôt say I see a difference after only 3 days but it was fun! Would be nice if the free trial was for a whole week.
5,ZLUAG,Very fun and relaxing and very much challenging it has a lot of learning tools to refresh your memory or just even to challenge your brain but it‚Äôs super fun and not boring g at all everyday is something new can always go back to your fav ü´∂üòÅ so worth it
5,Valentia,"Awesome app. The games are fun, and I believe this sort of thing, along with proper exercise, sleep and diet, helps keep the brain young. At 64, this really matters. The fact that the games are so enjoyable makes you want to play them often: Fun & functional = win-win."
4,MisSaydeez,I‚Äôve never been one for playing game on my phone but I love the thought process of the app. I love that it engages your mind instead of just mindlessly playing a game with no purpose. I also enjoy that the challenges are all different and get harder as you go!
5,EriceYeager,This app does what it promises. If you clicked the app it‚Äôs for a reason. Give it a try! For my job and overall mental health I hoped this app could help keep my brain sharp! And it definitely does! Thank you so much for helping and keeping this simple yet effective
5,curci96,This app has help me freakin up on a lot of things mentally! Sometimes with my work I don‚Äôt use a lot of the skills that are required in this app and it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm not wasting parts of my brain away
5,TheLanddon,Good brain exercise for memory and something better to do besides just using your phone for social media ‚Ä¶I think everybody should have this app on there phone it‚Äôs really beneficial and keep you on point
5,Ervdoggg,This is my first time trying something like this since brain age in the 2000‚Äôs. It‚Äôs definitely got some difficulty to it that gradually builds your mental capacity for memory. This is worth 5-15 minutes of everyday if not more.
5,BCHILL13,Really great for daily use. Notifications aren‚Äôt too buggy and it actually gets me excited to play the little games ü§£. I‚Äôve also started feeling more sharp and attentive since playing everyday.
4,You guys are so anonymous,I love this game so far! It‚Äôs amazing!I think it‚Äôs a little bit to easy for me but it‚Äôs not that hardly anything not to be rude or anything. I wish it had no adds. I‚Äôm sorry if this has hurt you. But this game is so much fun to play and has so many different kinds of games to play.
5,raygaytv,"I‚Äôve been looking for ways to keep my mind sharp, since i spend so much time on my phone might as well use my brain, but also make it fun ü§∑üèæ. This app was the perfect way."
5,TamiTrue...,I have tried and many brain training apps but Impulse is the best.  The variety of challenges is impressive and the no-nonsense scoring makes it so much more fun.   I look forward to my daily training session everyday.
5,Playa 1224,"I‚Äôve been noticing my inability to remember things like I used to and have been losing things. I‚Äôm hoping this will help me improve on both of those  flaws, while having fun doing it! Definitely recommend."
5,Shawn a.k.a pilliger,I look forward to the random training daily. The mixture of different mental exercises is stimulating for me and usually draws me into spending 10+ minutes playing random games each morning.
5,hayden 821,If you wanna stop wasting ur time playing games on ur phone or even scrolling on social media this would help u spend that time instead working on different puzzles and games designed to make ur brain work
4,T.Clovax,"It is a nice app to challenge my older brain, although very easy I‚Äôm assuming when purchased it can be harder or you can choose other modes. The price seems right if the rest of the app continues to expand upon what I experienced in the first 15 min"
5,Doan_er,This app is fun to play and easy to pick up. There is a wide array of fun and simple game to engage your brain and improve mental aptitude. I enjoy playing every day and finding out about how my brain works and tips to how to learn based on my personality and archetype.
5,jazzzz:D,this app is by far the most amazing app it keeps my brain working but at the same time it expands in many different ways when it come to learning
5,Taniaüå∏,"Absolutely love this app, have been using it for about 3 years. It is very relaxing but I want my son to use it on his iPad.   QUESTION: Is family sharing available? I cannot get any information online."
3,Bamcar1,"I enjoy the game but today when I came to play the game, it had logged me out and so now I have the frustration of playing games that are at the very beginning with none of my progress saved. The frustrating part is also that I don‚Äôt see a way to login and get back my information."
5,Goldberry77,"As a beginner, I don‚Äôt know how much I like the games overall.      But I love that they are easy at first. I can do them at my own pace, make errors, and still feel good. Haven‚Äôt made any errors except in pre-game tutorials.      So far, it‚Äôs very good."
3,Mr. Church,"If you are looking for something to fill the hole left behind from Brain Age on the DS along with making some of the absurd hours of screen time accrued feel productive as opposed to habitual, Impulse is a fantastic option. I‚Äôm also a sucker for personality/archetype tests (it‚Äôs like my astrology) and I like to reward myself with a bit of that after I do some brain games."
5,@little_brrri,"I do love the app. It has fun brain games, quizzes you can take to determine your personality and archetype, puzzles, etc. You do have to pay for it, but it gives you a discount for the first year. To me it was worth it at the discounted price."
3,sukoyoso,"I really enjoy the activities and questionaire‚Äôs on this app but i don‚Äôt apperciate being forced to pay to review every single report/analysis after the completion of said activities. I completely understand that money is required to keep it going but just to view one report, come on, theres more than enough ads."
5,Brandileigh3,Impulse has a variety of games. All of which are challenging but fun. The additional quizzes for IQ and Left/Right Dominance are also fun and the results are interesting. Impulse has been a wonderful stress relief and I look forward to my daily challenges.
5,oh shoot!,"This app is great to help keep your mind sharp, and also to challenge you to open up some creative ways of thinking and perceiving. Plus it just a fun challenge. Like having a personal workout trainer for your brain."
5,Amogusgamer5,"This is a great way to build up your brain, with a versatile mixture of simple and complex exercises that will help you monitor your progress, and maintain your progress and productivity. Would recommend you to give it a shot"
5,ivyjem,"It‚Äôs a game changer for me, I‚Äôve tried many games and this one seems to work for me. Especially with my attention span I see a difference when I‚Äôm working on a project I‚Äôm able to focus for longer a time."
5,vee 8 ),I‚Äôve got a few test that I have to say I didn‚Äôt realize I still remember how to do those things and I‚Äôm speaking about the order of operations . The app  exercises my memory.I feel better after I use the app.
5,MTRisner,"This is the best brain training app on the planet! You not only get daily training to keep your brain fast and fresh but you get other tests like left rain/right brain, ADHD, IQ tests and so much more. I highly recommend you try it!"
5,Debbi J.,This app is affordable and it‚Äôs excellent!! If your trying to exercise your memory and other mental skills and it‚Äôs fun so you can more easily keep using the app to keep your brain in shape for years!! There‚Äôs a 1 year plan that‚Äôs affordable too.
1,Rashu123,I wanted to try the app and it took me straight to trial of 3 weeks. Once u r on the plans page I pressed the back button coz I didn‚Äôt even want to do the trial but it registered me for trial. Then I couldn‚Äôt find the unsubscribe option. It wasn‚Äôt in the subscriptions page in settings nor anywhere on app. I had to write to support email on app and waiting for response.  Games were ok.
5,Willowstar13,I absolutely love this game it is so helpful I play it 24/7 the only downside is that I have to pay to get some games but other than that it‚Äôs so fun it helps so much you should definitely try it have fun
5,Ashyyyy girllll,Hello my name is ash and I am just going to say I got this game yesterday and it is so much fun and I mean so much fun this is my day two and I love that I can have my memory my fastness and more improved imma give you guys a five star rating cuz you guys have an awesome/amazing fun andUniquely civilized game
5,WestlandSelfie,Just getting started and I‚Äôm already appreciating the challenges. It starts off super easy and makes you earn your way to higher levels. Just as you would do in the gym.
5,bibbiddi bop bop bop,"It has everything that I like, it has math, it has memory games, it even helps you with attention! If I could I would rate 12 star! This doesn‚Äôt just train your brain,  it‚Äôs also fun! That‚Äôs why I rate this game 5 stars."
5,Doringnotboring,This is is a way better use of the few minutes it takes to sharpen the mind rather then getting sucked into a scrolling binge on social media
1,AAndrew,"This app looks like it has some fun brain games, and after being bombarded with ads on IG, I figured I would give it a whirl.   Tries to get you to sign up for a subscription before you even play it, then offered me 92% off after playing a few samples.   One star for the deceitful pricing structure. I would buy it outright if that were an option, but the only option was constant access to my bank account."
5,Latonskii,"Daily brain exercises, interesting surveys, and fun free games! Honestly it‚Äôs a great time waster and definitely makes good brain food. Only issue is the fact that you have to pay for a lot of the features, but it‚Äôs still pretty cheap."
5,Debioutlaw,Definitely challenges my mind/ brain. I‚Äôve been questioning my cognitive skills lately and coming across this app helps me think harder and test my brain!!  I feel like it can only help and improve my aging mind!
5,Ch√©47,"I love Impulse, the mind games are great and help keep me sharp. But I especially love the tests and quiz‚Äôs, they help you learn about yourself and so far I‚Äôve been asked questions that really expand my way of thinking. I hope I continue to reap the benefits of this awesome app!"
5,Teacher Del,"This app is easy to use, doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time and you can feel the brain stimulation at the couple of each training exercise. Highly recommend it to help keep your brain sharp."
3,JonathanLawson,This app is not free you need premium to access everything and even if you have the trial on you can‚Äôt access everything which is just flat out irritating. What you can access is 5 star worthy however so I suppose if you have the money to throw around this is for you.
5,Ridiculous57,"I‚Äôm on Day 2 of training.  I like the variety of the games so far.  The app also includes games you can play on your own in addition to the ones selected for you in the training session.  So far, so good!"
5,nun yo buz wax,"I love this app sm, I go on it all the time I have been m on this app for 1 week and love it. They say it helps your brain sharpen which is really cool. These hard puzzles are so much fun to solve. There are adds but not a lot which is cool. You need to get this app I‚Äôm being Fr."
5,SargentK.,I downloaded this app Impulse 3 days ago and it‚Äôs fun and challenging You‚Äôll even learn a thing or two while your having a blast playing‚Ä¶so many games to choose from you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
5,Marlaina Jade,I‚Äôm normally not one to pay for apps but this is definitely worth it. The games are fun and not super hard. Hard enough to make you think but also enjoy them.
5,Cherxoxo,I love it I‚Äôm 64 and where I‚Äôm usually working I‚Äôve been off lately I‚Äôd like to think I still have my wits about me when I do your game it lets me know where I‚Äôm at so to speak I feel better when I‚Äôve done well!!    My sincerest remarks!! Cher Mack aka Rodrigues
5,Ufcchick71,I have played many of the games and puzzles.  They are so fun and challenging!  It‚Äôs a great way to redirect the mind if you have trouble letting things go or need to stop thinking about something unpleasant.  Did I say challenging?!  Best part is the challenge.
5,Skoo Sully,"I have only just begun to play the games in this app and I am already hooked! Will come back to update after I have been using it for a while, but so far 10/10 definitely recommend!"
5,losregalado,Similar games to ones I‚Äôve seen from the best of research teams. Curious to see if I get any insights or tests without the paid version tho.  We shall see.  Still worth the download even if it‚Äôs just a few free (and ad-free) games a day.
4,itstime12,"I‚Äôm only on day two , I really like the games , they do challenge me . I am looking forward to seeing if I noticed improvement in 30 days . I always see and hear things about diet and exercise but not enough about keeping the brain healthy too ."
5,LeahBeeeuhh,I cannot put this app down! I bought it the first day I tried it. It seriously feels like a workout for your brain. Like I‚Äôm getting smarter by the minute! So fun! Highly recommended!  Only suggestion: add more fun facts/health tips/brain health information!
5,meenoig,Impulsive is the best app to help with memory and learning so far! It‚Äôs very fun and useful. I would recommend it to all ages that would actually be able to comprehend what it‚Äôs asking! Be careful this game is easily addicting. The ads are to help.
5,BLAQUER THAN WITE,"I definitely enjoy keeping my mind busy! I definitely enjoy keeping my mind busy!  My moma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, Forest they‚Äôll be gone before you get the box!"
5,BearLife31,Really liking the app so far after 1 week of downloading. It really makes you use skills that you don‚Äôt really use on a daily basis. Highly recommended and make sure to just take it one day at a time‚Ä¶ as it should be.üòÉ
5,Scarlett Longstocking,Oh this has been such a great source of brain exercise because the games are all different and a good variety is posted daily. Each day is a different group of games which keeps things fresh.
5,peeperslayer9000,"It made my brain grow so large it made me find the cure for cancer and it made my brain. Become mega mind I was even able to rip out my pancreas and make an artificial one. Then next, I became Einstein and started twerking superficous definiously and next, I started gaining the powers of Gojo and became a Gojo supremos."
5,VividDreams,I enjoy the exercises this app has to offer! I might be purchasing full premium to see my progress. I will want to come back in a month and leave another review to see any improvements on myself.
4,fotogirl2009,I like this app a lot. The only thing that I find lacking is that it‚Äôs kind of sensitive in some games and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòread‚Äô my responses accurately. Particularly the line drawing game. I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone who likes brain training and puzzles though. I‚Äôm glad I bought it.
5,Les192526,I‚Äôm getting older and want to make sure I exercise my brain. ‚ÄúUse it or lose it‚Äù so I‚Äôm using it and this game helps that and makes it fun while doing it! I want to keep playing even after doing my daily tasks!
4,wooiljin,"I just downloaded this app, but it‚Äôs a great way to test your brain, stay sharp and entertained while in the go. I‚Äôd recommend this for anyone who‚Äôs had enough of candy crush type games, and wants to upgrade to something that gets your brain to workout."
5,minnnnnnnnaaaaaaa,Impulse is such a fun & addictive game. Simple but challenging all at the same time. Love the brain refresher it gives you. Even my daughter loves it who is only 8. It has helped her learn division & multiplication quickly. Give this game a try & you definitely won‚Äôt regret it !!
5,funnygirl511,"I finally found an app that helps me to focus, and also helps with memory and logic skills. The best part of it is that it‚Äôs fun too! I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to improve their brain function."
5,Ajax983,I spent 5 weeks in a coma in 2019 and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not as sharp as I was before so doing these exercises via fun games really helps keep me focused and it‚Äôs helped improve my memory and other fundamental skills! Highly recommend!!!
3,GamerGirl3020,The impulse app was very useful to me because I had games I enjoyed playing and helped me with my problems until you now have to pay to play most of the games which is kinda stupid in my opinion because now all the good games in my opinion are for money and now I don‚Äôt use the app anymore it was good before now it‚Äôs not
5,Aunt_CC521,I‚Äôm 36 years old and they never had proper treatment for my ADHD‚Ä¶ and I feel less kind of helps you with your memory and hopefully the goal is gonna help me. Focus a bit better and learn to multitask better without medication.
2,rm0113,"After 3 days, you have to get a membership ($7/week or $50 for lifetime) which is ridiculously expensive for brain games. In order to start an additional 3-day trial, you still have to subscribe..  Also, the game that is advertised (with the rings) is NOT one of the games. I did enjoy the ones offered, but they have the same games for free on the PEAK app.   Loved it at first, but now the developers are just greedy. üòî"
5,Meredith103,I like to start the day with Impulse training to keep my mind sharp. Some of the games are fun so I go back to those throughout the day. It definitely helps me reset and come back to work with more focus.
5,Duchess Nadia,Downloaded the app yesterday. Brain-training games are interesting & entertaining; tests present a great opportunity for self-discovery. I feel that my brain is going to become more agile and my attention to details will improve. Love the app!
5,Deborah MB,I experienced a concussion last year and I‚Äôm finding this app extremely helpful in sharpening my cognitive brain skills again!  Highly recommend fun and easy easy to understand how it works.
4,t71636382927474929,"For those who want to use their time wisely. When you have the time to sit and diddle on a game why not make it one to better the mind. Extremely fun, easy to get going, just wish it was all free, but I still appreciate what they bring to the table."
5,Mommas trying to live,I have had All leukemia and 2 bone marrow transplants within 8 months.i am having brain issues due to the chemo and being septic and in the ICU for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs helping with my brain function. and memoryüò¢üëç
5,psrest,"I‚Äôve had a brain injury and learned that part of the recuperation is using different brain exercises. This app has a lot of very valuable for the brain, to keep different aspects of it stimulated. I Recommend it."
1,Dlisad,"I purchased a year subscription. I enjoyed using app and advancing my experience scores.   Then I was logging on after ten days straight. App told me I had to log on again???   I did and it reset everything. Everything was lost, I have to start from scratch. It‚Äôs aggravating , I  would like to delete the whole thing but it‚Äôs paid for a year.  I hate to start over just to lose it all again!  Is there a fix for this?"
5,JahSoldier03,"This app has helped me on just two days to think clearly and help with important decisions, I recommend this app to anyone that wants to take control over their own mental activity."
5,Yareli_r,I‚Äôve been using this when I wake up in the morning instead of scrolling through my phone and it really helps me and my brain wake up. It‚Äôs been an amazing tool
5,KingMare98,This app has been my brain food now and each time I see it pop up I want to feed my brain with something productive. This gives me a chance to do so and I‚Äôm glad I came across it.
5,Chezy69,I have enjoyed the app 75% more than my peers in the same difficulty level. I generally do not purchase apps. I did find this app to be an interesting concept and I am happy with my progress so far.
5,L.L7231,Saw this on a Tiktok ad and thought it was another app that you had to pay a fortune to use. I was wrong. Impulse is a great app to train your brain and improve cognitive functions. Absolutely Honest Review. 10/10 Definitely recommend!
5,t1oreo,I like it because the exercises are unique and informative. I‚Äôm not sure how this helps boost memory and focus but it‚Äôs more productive than playing video games that have no impact to personal growth or level of knowledge.
5,goose32,Love the games and challenges they offer to help train and strengthen my brain. I have ADHD and the the quick mind break this app allows me to have is amazing and I wish I could have had this years ago!
5,Yisenia,"I love it! I have Lupus and Fibromyalgia, it‚Äôs difficult to stay alert. I‚Äôve tried different things to exercise my brain, be alert, and healthy. So far, Impulse keeps me alert, engage, and it does work out my mind. I love it so far!"
5,Wild Fires rider,Some parts I scooted right through but then when I got to actual numbers instead of characters I see where I‚Äôm still having difficulty in life.
5,JJJJCCT,Will give the app a go and see where it takes me. If I remember to come to the app and it is able to keep my attention that would be a new thing for me. Stay tuned!
5,.GB.70,"The activities so far are pretty simple. But however simple or difficult, it‚Äôs great exercising my brain, stimulating areas of my mind to react to everyday images or actions that allows me to figure out why I react in one way or another."
5,Krystal1031,"This is a great app so far. I have only had it two days so I feel like I will need to write an update. I‚Äôm surprised at my results in the different areas. I hope this does help moving forward, I think it will :)"
5,seannananannnnaaana,"With all of the different skills the app helps me stay sharp on, I realize how much I use each subject in my every day life. The practice on here has made things a tiny bit easier"
5,Auatua,This is a really helpful app and it‚Äôs fun too but I don‚Äôt have the money to pay for it right now but I understand why they need to have purchases in the app it just makes me a little sad but that‚Äôs besides the point FIVE STARS!!!
5,YouUP?,Easy enough to understand and play. The difficulty moves up steadily and fluctuates throughout the playing process. My want to have it all mind likes the Chang around in between levels and games.
5,Smiley 00,The games they have are fun and it‚Äôs not to boring it‚Äôs like a lot of mini games. It‚Äôs pretty cool to know thing about your self threw their quiz‚Äôs or tests and the games aren‚Äôt all the same so if you get bored with on you can just switch
5,Irideny,"The UI is so smooth, I just want to keep solving puzzles. The puzzles and difficulty enough to make me think a bit, but not to hard to make me want to quit. A perfect app to pass time while doing some brain exercises!"
5,hdjxh h,This game has helped me see my self in a whole new light. It helps me stay sharp and focused I highly recommend this app to just help you stay sharp and learn about yourself through taking there tests
5,T1nk3,This app has all the ‚Äúbrain-games‚Äù in one!  Keeps it fun and engaging while tracking your progress and increasing difficulty. Absolutely a joy to use. Much better use of downtime than mindlessly scrolling social platforms
5,Jdjfjdis,I am so happy I got impulse it is helping me with my brain memorizing things and it‚Äôs just fun to do all of that cool puzzles I also like how it tells me how many I got wrong and how many I got right so I can do better next time. Thank you impulse.
5,Kealykae,"If your looking for a training app for the brain this is it! Super fun games that you can‚Äôt stop playing! The app also has little tests that can take you‚Äôve ever wondered about your IQ, learning style, personality type etc.! Worth the download!"
5,Charlie&Cash2022,I love doing this app when I wake up because it‚Äôs helps me wake up for 1 and because it helps me think better sometimes I will get aggravated if I can‚Äôt figure something out but it just helps me do better!
5,Best tacoo ever,A fun game that replaced half the games on my phone all while providing a unique way of tracking progress and improvement in skills. A good challenge that can feel like a brain massage. Highly recommend it
5,CAJules,"I recommend this app. Brain health is so critical especially for you in the workplace. This doesn‚Äôt take much time, and really helps your brain get a workout. It‚Äôs not horrendously difficult either."
1,Pgroot,I ended up with this app after seeing an ad that showed some interesting charts/metrics. Have yet to see the charts shown in the advertisement and accidentally purchased a year subscription when i accepted a chance discount because the wording didnt specify accepting the discount would confirm purchase. The rest of the app is okay but really just a collection of simple games- way lower effort than some other brain training apps ive seen or tried previously.
4,lauritaaaü§ûü§ûü§û,this game is fire nd like i love the one line game cuz i‚Äôm the goat at it but please i beg remove the ads ESPECIALLY THE BINGO ONE PLEASE i do not care enough to play bingo and make some of that mula please i need to keep grinding so i can continue being da goat plez nd ty also unlock more levels i‚Äôm about to finish all 35 within like 10-15 minutes gracias üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè yall da goats fr
5,Aol addict,"Doing this stimulates your brain to give you the same energy as if you were going to the Gym and having a full workout with your body , except for your brain ‚Ä¶"
5,Ilans S,I have been playing this game for the last few days and really really loving it!  I have seen a few of these type of games and this one has definitely got what I was looking for!! Thank you
5,roslimm,impulse is so easy to use correct and obv. has nothing to do with math. it made me feel lesser small and positive about it. Impulse is such a fun tool i use it corresponding to music and passing hours of time when my small bigger children are sleeping.
5,GE-Sa'Linda,I really enjoy this app it actually makes you use your brain. I think of it as brain exercise. We work hard to keep our body‚Äôs in shape so why not do the same for one of our body important organs?
5,dfijewski,I knew that my cognitive skills were waning and I‚Äôve been looking for a simple yet fun way to work on sharpening them. This app has done just that while also showing the extent of my cognitive decline. This is easy and fun enough to keep going.
5,Number1pimp,"I really enjoy the slight anxious feeling that this gives me from completing timed quizzes. It‚Äôs kind of psycho, but I‚Äôd rather like this over getting praised for doing stiff motions that have absolutely nothing to do with the song that I‚Äôm mouthing along to then explaining that my career is that."
5,Jay Namaste 8,"It‚Äôs quick, easy and fun! I‚Äôve read that unpredictability, flowing activity like ballroom dancing and crossword puzzles can prevent Dementia and keep you sharper longer.   This is that, in less time, on your phone and with more variety!"
5,drphiljr,"Have been enjoying the games since purchasing the app. Can get sucked into playing, but that better than scrolling social media apps. Wide variety of games, which keeps you challenged."
5,LarryBoy Fed,"After COVID I had bad ‚Äúbrain-fog.‚Äù Lost for words and forgetting something that was JUST NOW TALKED ABOUT reoccurred regularly.  These exercises are fun, frustrating at times, and appear to be slowly helping my cognition/memory already.  My wife has noticed it too.  Thank you!!!!!"
5,Sa-Clori-A,"It‚Äôs a fun game to keep a woman like me on her toes, it‚Äôs good to know what your  average brain speed should be based on your age. It‚Äôs challenging to see how the accuracy is on each level it helps you to improve yourself. The ball sort game is Also my favorite"
5,screw insta,"I didn‚Äôt think I would use this game when I found it, but I am hooked! I can see my brain working differently and sharpening my skills while playing a game is hands down the best way to go for mg ADD brain. I love it!"
5,Katrinakm,Very well designed. Games and exercises are fun and short enough that you don‚Äôt get frustrated. Instant rewards that keep you coming back for more. Has difficulty level for everyone.
5,Slaytanic Warmonger,"The variety is what makes it great, but it‚Äôs overall very well thought out. I‚Äôve tried other apps but this is the one that will last without getting boring.  Highly recommend it!"
5,LaBoA666,"Just like we work out our body we should work out our brain!  The app give you from walking to sprinting, all kinds of workouts to train your brain.  That‚Äôs what it takes to keep it young and sharp!"
5,Kelly M. Henry,"I love this app because the short games fit well with my busy schedule. The app contains brain exercises that pull me away from the mind numbing social media consumption vortex, which is a very good thing. I enjoy exercising my brain with this app."
2,RKSem89,I didn‚Äôt want to pay a subscription for brain training but I enjoyed playing their games for free. The ads finally got too annoying so I caved an paid $5 to have ads removed‚Ä¶ only to discover the $5 only removed ads from one of the games. So I‚Äôm stopping this app. There are plenty of other puzzle-type game apps that don‚Äôt constantly ask for more money.
5,Spidernite,I just started so I can‚Äôt say that if I have improved yet but I have heard good things about it I will keep at it I have a issue with simple memory loss like keys. But I can remember historical information.  I hope this help me.
4,888AK,I like this app but a test I was really excited to take wasn‚Äôt on here. I kept seeing the ink blot test but it isn‚Äôt on my app. I like the games so i bought it for the year. I am disappointed that the tests are not as advertised though
5,Blink1982,I really do hope these games are helping my brain. They are not only fun but by letting you know what percentage you are better than your peers it makes it competitive and I‚Äôm all about that!
5,Natuallylovely,I am getting what I hoped for! Thus far this app is great! I am always up to a challenge and try to improve on my mental daily. So having an app like this that‚Äôs ‚Äúhandy‚Äù (üôÉ) is really helpful. I‚Äôm looking forward to more challenges.
5,Theftigeyghkvv,"It helps my mind focus without getting distracted it has a bunch of mini games that you can play and, you can also get a free trial for only so much I used to struggle with mental math but this just helped me 5 stars for sure!"
5,jacecash,This is insightful and fun. It‚Äôs great for getting a perspective of cognitive ability and improvement in that ability. It‚Äôs nice to know that I can improve my skills with my busy schedule without it being a chore.
3,GCP.1,"I prepaid for a year subscription. My phone had an issue and as I transfer all files and apps, I attempt to sign into Impulse for my subscription to activate on this new phone. I don‚Äôt have an account according to their website. I tried emailing support and almost 24 hours later, no email. Help."
2,Ma651,I was excited to download this App and eagerly  paid for the annual subscription. That was a mistake. After a few weeks the daily training becomes boring and repetitive which leaves little excitement to do daily training. I am stuck for the year so I am working on the games instead. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did and do the full trial before committing!
1,Cccodie123,"This app is misleading and frequently charges without the full knowledge and consent of the app user.  After reading through reviews, (after downloading, my own fault :( ) it‚Äôs easy to see that multiple people have brought this to the attention of the developers. They are fully aware‚Äî yet they have not made any moves to change this and clearly intend to continue.  This is just a warning, do not download this app."
5,RAY-GAMES,"This is the best app. I love how they give you games other then daily games. It‚Äôs super fun and good for your brain. I would recommend it if you like playing brain games. I don‚Äôt want to make this long so, that is why you should get it."
5,Supdayna,"I feel like I stopped using my phone because all I would do is scroll aimlessly. I‚Äôm new to this app, but so far it‚Äôs made me feel better about my being on my phone."
4,LMIVXX,"I love the app but since the latest upgrade, there are games that don‚Äôt function well - Pass the ball is one example. It opens fine, gives you instructions, etc. but nothing happens when you tap the tiles."
2,CarrieLizz94,"Really weird that the first 3 tests it gave me I got better than 90%, 98%, and then 99% of my peers; THEN it asks you to commit with a discount off.  Almost like those stats are fibbed to make you feel good about yourself. I‚Äôd love to see what other people actually make on those tests, and if everyone gets the ‚Äú92% off‚Äù present right after, too. üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I mean, smart, Impulse. I‚Äôm sure you get a lot of people with these tricks."
4,Not mine 333,"I‚Äôm enjoying the app but as everything else it‚Äôs not until you sign up that you discover that unless you pay you only get to try 3 games. How can people aford to pay $5+/month for every app they use? Anyway, $6.89 is a hefty fee for a game."
5,TACsdk,This is my second day of Impulse. What I like about it is I turn off the tv and sit in quiet to play the games. It truly shows me how distracting TV and my phone are. Hoping to continue improving my memory.
5,lexim717,"Great for us old people trying to keep our brain power flowing. lol Only a few days playing, but worth the little cost so far. I feel like it‚Äôs good for my anxiety as it puts my mind in a more productive place. üòâ"
5,Celphalobob,"This game has been so much fun. You will have to purchase a subscription, but it‚Äôs well worth all of the training, tests, and everyday games it gives you in order to engage your brain activity!"
5,girlwiththeeye,"I really do enjoy these games, they are fun easy to understand and I love how it tracks your progress. They aren‚Äôt too long either they are short but you end up doing more not knowing they are taking time."
5,Tiffles0807,"So much more than just a game. Helps you exercise your brain and understand how your brain works. Specifically programs to you and your type of learning, setting up specific goals for yourself."
1,Angryginger8008,"You cannot do anything in this app without a subscription. Find a quiz you want to take? Great, spend X minutes completing, only to find at the end your results are held hostage by a subscription fee. There are a million other resources that will give you the same information without constantly hounding you for money. That said, kudos to marketing - I was the idiot who clicked the link into this hellhole in the first place."
4,ooooooggrzfwathim,Overall enjoying this app and I only have the free version. Wish this app tracked across devices. Not sure if i have an account in which i could log into on a new device. Streak did not transfer over when i tried
4,Crossfox1,So far I like it but I chose to pay 39 dollars for the year and got charged 51 dollars. I‚Äôm not certain what‚Äôs going on with apple and I can handle a few more dollars but I don‚Äôt much like not having the choice of what I‚Äôm paying. üòíI better get the lifetime membership ‚Ä¶
5,smandy1729,I worked in a field where we did brain training daily with our clients. I loved it so much. Impulse using great games to help me achieve getting in a few mins if brain training daily. Highly recommend!!
5,Owl 27 üëåüèΩ,"It‚Äôs a great app to distract yourself for a few minutes and while you are having fun and challenging yourself, you are actually training your mind and improving.  Highly recommend it."
5,LunaAnn.Kay,"I love this app, and i mostly use it to help with anxiety :). It has alotsss of gaming options that each challenge different parts of the brain, but that are also supppper fun!üòç I would recommend, although theres fees :(. Other then so, its awesome!"
5,Cobalt Dar,I try to play brain games at least 10 minutes everyday to keep my mind sharp. This is by far the most challenging and versatile brain game app I‚Äôve found. Highly recommend.
4,"kdnd,shodnfn","Impulse is a decent game, although I haven‚Äôt seen any results yet of change in my experience. It does get your mind off of things that you may be stressing about though. And clears your mind. It also makes me know myself better with tests, like an aptidute test, or a adhd test."
5,Gail Arae,"Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs working yet because it‚Äôs only been one day. I think Impulse should wait to ask after 10 days of use. But either way, so far it‚Äôs fun and I think I feel my brain stretching."
5,Msmbsell,I struggle with memory issues as well as a variety of things- in the process of being tested for a lot- so this is good to keep your brain engaged- and I don‚Äôt like games on my phone
5,Mama EMB,"Not like other brain training apps at all!! I was pleasantly surprised and impressed!! The challenges are reasonable and not too long or boring, keeps you intrigued and wanting more!!"
5,ÍÄ≠ÍçèÍà§Íçü,"I actually hate paying for apps, impulse though, is the only exception. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for playing little games on my phone cause they are puzzles! And I can definitely feel myself getting smarter. So addicting."
5,Felipe Huertas 77,"I initially downloaded the all because it was free,  and I was going to deleted it after the free period (third day) But after I finished the first round of activities I  ended up buying all of this in the first 15 mins of training. That‚Äôs how cool the app is."
5,reneexx16,"It does have you pay, I won‚Äôt lie, but I personally believe it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve never had a test or quiz, get me so well. And then they have mini games to play to keep your mind sharp! Why wouldn‚Äôt you want that!"
5,Ralph Martinez III,I stubbled on this app and instantly got hook. I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù games and I quickly got bored of the small selection of games. This game will definitely stay on phone for a while!
4,Signbrat04,This gives you a great brain stimulation that allows you to have a quick response in problem solving and math and memory  In all areas has improved my brain that allows me to do my job better and think more clearly
5,NateP6126,"This app provides a challenging experience with increasing difficulty as you progress. It‚Äôs quite fun, with the games being simply designed but made to test and push your skills. It‚Äôs like a souls game but for exercising your mindüòÇ"
5,12$?;)43;,This was an awesome game for me and my daughter to play. We are improving our memory each day by playing it for 10 minutes each day. Totally recommend for you or your family.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3,BrFlann123456789,"So, I get one wrong in last stage of fairly advanced level of game and perform better than 0%. Similar results across the board. App is a hair trigger to either 99% or 0%. Theoretically possible, yes, but likely, no.   Also, no ability to back up to easier levels just to practice if not doing well at harder levels is silly"
5,@Craycraft_Cory,"I love to play these when I get the midday boring blues. If you‚Äôve got a busy schedule and are looking to relax with stayin away from your typical instagram, Facebook, TikTok, repeat formula this is the perfect game to play because it‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs a guilty pleasure to make you smarter!"
5,Jada lael,"This application gets me going ! Each game designed to teach you new things about yourself, the knowledge needed and how to expand your thinking in ways you didn‚Äôt know you comprehended . Amazing! I love this friggin‚Äôapp! I‚Äôd recommend impulse any era ü§ûüèæ‚ú®"
4,Ishtar Yo,I like this game very much and my only problem is the ads. After each short trainings there‚Äôs an ad to get through but if you buy the game you wouldn‚Äôt have the ads. I would definitely buy it if I had the extra money.
4,MR5212,I love how this really works my brain and always gives me something to do. The only reason it‚Äôs not a five is because there are somethings you can‚Äôt do because you have to pay but most of the things you can do so it‚Äôs awesome and I love that it really works my brain
5,Transparency T,Great thing is rather than scrolling through social media and/or playing mind numbing games on an app. Much rather be brain exercising with fun and creative thinking. It very easy at first but then it starts to get more difficult.
5,Oceanwwave,"Helps with memory and pattern, match, recognition, motor skills! FUN NOT BORING OR HARD! Starts out easy and follows your lead with total effort and continues building up your brain and making it process and productive! Train your brain and keep it polished for any task!"
5,RanchoMike75,"The app has every thing needed to wake your brain up lol. Better then coffee. I play the games and do tests only the daily. Games get harder as you progress. Suffering from post concussion syndrome, the app has help me regain brainpower again."
5,FocusMindedPhoto,I like to take my daily challenges during the day to stay off social media apps during down time.  Seeing my ratings against others helps me focus on the areas I‚Äôm weaker.
5,oooof1010,"Well designed, clear instructions, engaging, simple but challenging, short convenient game play for anyone with that oh so common problem nowadays: time confetti. So easy to knock of a round or two waiting in line or in a spare moment where ever it may occur. Awesome üëçüèº"
4,Chlo-Chlo_Chanel456,I love this app. I just got it today and it is super fun. It trains my brain and makes me think outside the box. I recommend this app for learning and fun. The one problem is that there are adds every 10 seconds. I don‚Äôt really like that but I guess it teaches you how to be patientüòÑ
5,Jason Curry,I‚Äôve tried many of these types of apps over the years and this one is the best designed and functioning and the exercises are not too long.
5,helga.hi,"I really like how this app started me off with easy enough tasks and then gradually got more difficult.  This app offers a lot of different tests, puzzles, and games that can keep any mind busy or focused.  Really loving this!"
5,Manaconda Maximo,"This app helps use both sides of my brain at the same time, get to be creative & problem solving ,best or both worlds and actually real games with ability"
5,kidding kynleigh,"It is a really good app. The games push you, where other apps don‚Äôt. This app really knows how to get you to learn something that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to on your own, because it pushes you to the perfect amount."
5,mythoughts2020,I saw ads for Impulse probably fifty times and decided that I‚Äôd try it. I signed up for the weekly and I‚Äôm enjoying it. It doesn‚Äôt feel like work which makes it easy for me to keep going.
5,ramibunch,This has kept my attention and focus better than scrolling! Super fun games that tailor its level to how your doing. They also have workouts with different games that help target different areas. It‚Äôs fun.
5,jojo benzo,It‚Äôs relatively entertaining and seems to have good variety of different types of games. I did the relax and unwind style so my games are probably more enjoyable than the ‚Äútest me‚Äù kind of ones. There are a zillion ads though. But it‚Äôs enjoyable
5,verifiedAppUser,I enjoy this app because it gives you a space to wine down but also challenges you in a healthy manner to where you don‚Äôt feel like you are not productive at all.
5,hejdihrod,It‚Äôs a real good app that has allowed to spend hours of my time on learning and practicing basic skills. The only downside is you have to buy a subscription for more puzzles and more help.
5,marynrose,I‚Äôm not a game person AT ALL but i saw an ad for this && totally fell in love !! it really does keep you thinking and using your brain in the best way. i‚Äôve already bought the lifetime package and can‚Äôt wait for the daily challenges.
5,otter3182,"Outstanding, I love these games it makes you think quickly and react quickly, it starts slow but picks up the more you do it, helps with my concentration and focus, thanks!"
4,gypsyMoon87,"If you can get past all of the incredibly long ads the games are really good. I‚Äôm not on my phone much so I wanted some quick brain games I could play throughout the day, unfortunately the ads take up too much time so I‚Äôm deleting the app."
4,makayla sinpson,I like this game but i thin that it should be more of the trasing thing its really fun to me and i think for others to!! So i would be aneroid to make a change!! I hope you guys have a great day and enjoy your weekend with your family and friends!! Bye hope you love the thoughts that i gave!!.
5,Irishlrd,"Every morning before work, I sit on my porch, enjoy my coffee and do some sudoku to help my mind wake up. I decided to try this and so far, so good. I just wish the adds could be space out in between games."
5,Lv0128,You don‚Äôt need a trial‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs free for all just hit the x if you want to get it it just makes you do extra things anyways‚Ä¶Thanks developers for making this app! I‚Äôm happy and healthy only at the age of 8 Hope you have a nice day bye!
5,Deb. K. R.,"I had been searching for a free brain-training game and this was the one for me! It has excellent training courses and fun games. WiFi is not needed so it is accessible anytime, anywhere. Impulse was the best choice I could make for a brain-training game!"
1,Eri.000,"üíÄ you literally cant use it with ought making a purchase because of how irritating the adds are. A 60 question quizz and every 5 question you get an add that takes 15 seconds away. And I‚Äôm not quite know much about it tests but repeatedly putting the missing piece of what looks like a children‚Äôs puzzle....I don‚Äôt think that will accurately determine IQ. Even if the test was not meant to be realistic neither taken seriously, the adds are killing me!!!"
1,02/17/20,"I Downloaded the app a few weeks ago. Initially it was great but after a few days it was simply not moving to the following day. I haven‚Äôt been able to keep playing the daily games for a week now. I left a feedback through the app and no response, it‚Äôs been a couple of days. Right now I would say it‚Äôs not worth the money and feels like a trap and complete waste of money as the app is not cheap at all. I hope that I am wrong and whatever is going will get fixed."
3,KAM.01,"This game used to be super fun, then over time they‚Äôve added adds to where you‚Äôre waiting longer just for them to pass then the actual time your playing the games. I don‚Äôt want to sit for 45 seconds between each game to watch an add. Sadly I‚Äôll be deleting this app."
5,Gina Madison,The games are great but there seems to be a lag and it causes the app to think that I‚Äôve gotten the answer wrong when I really was just faster than the app.
4,bednigo,I love it and think it is a great way to use my brain creativity. The one problem is that there are so many adds. You can pay for no adds but if you don‚Äôt want to you‚Äôre just gonna have to deal with them.
5,muse11,These games and tasks really made me aware that I need to listen intently to find details of assignments. They really made me think and I felt a sense of pride when I realized I understood and could perform at the level expected.
5,dishydoesit,Like that I have to actually think when I‚Äôm on my phone  Fun to pass time if nothing else to do
5,Mmmvegas,I have been please with the training exercises and am hopeful that it will help keep my mind sharp as I get older.  Having something measurable is helpful for me to determine where I am. This is produces a measurable score.
5,kindiesandy,Impulse has a variety of ‚Äúgames‚Äù that challenge me different ways. Each time I play I can tell my consentration and memory focus are getting better. And there‚Äôs enough variety to not be boring.
5,Edv0luti0n,"In an age with so much mental vomit circulating around us . This game is like a run through a mental obstacle course that gives me the mental dexterity to finish my work day, week and so on . I like it and I‚Äôm a better person for it ."
5,Babygirl UPT,This game helps with focus and thinking especially as you get older. When you want to pass time and feed your brain it‚Äôs great a to keep up with how things are changing.
1,MarieSTL,"After downloading and then answering a bunch of questions, this so-called ‚Äúfree‚Äù app still wouldn‚Äôt let me play any games without forcing me to sign up for either a paid plan, or a ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial that costs money after a few days. I didn‚Äôt choose any, and when trying to close the app, it signed me up for the trial. I did NOT agree to this, so if I get charged through my Apple account, I will report this fraud to the FTC and every agency possible."
1,Malcolm Jamal Warner,"If you want to just try this app, don‚Äôt. It offers a free trial for the membership (there is no different types of access, just payment schedules) but the free trial doesn‚Äôt actually get you the access. It limits you on everything and says you need to subscribe to continue. Its only goal is just to hope you forget to cancel, not actually to try to convert people into customers after experiencing their product."
5,BAM151515,Impulse is a great way to challenge yourself with many games. So far I‚Äôve enjoyed all of them. Im always excited to see what challenges are next to continue working on skills for me.
3,Duh - rell,"I love this game, but in Candy Sort the levels don‚Äôt track correctly. For example, I played 5 levels in a row, left the game, and when I came back it didn‚Äôt count two of the levels forcing me to have to redo them. This sort of thing happens regularly."
5,XtremeSheri,This is a great app with many different variations and activities. I‚Äôm happy so far and I recommend it and it‚Äôs not mindless activity on a phone. Enjoy I paid for the lifetime because it made the most senseü§ó
5,FallenCaveGoblin,"Good games, smooth sound design, engaging. Starts off a bit too easy but you aren‚Äôt limited by purchases. It still will give you results and info without purchase"
5,IndySparky,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure that it‚Äôs improving my cognitive abilities (but it can‚Äôt hurt). But it‚Äôs a fun collection of quick games that can keep you entertained. Lots of these games have similar counterparts in standalone apps, but it is nice to have them all collected in one app."
5,haxzerer,"I turned my phone black and white. Deleted all my socials. The only app i use when i'm bored now is the impulse app.   This app honestly trains your brain and it's better then tiktok, snapchat, instagram and facebook. Why scroll on your phone for an hour when you could be training your brain.   And for the people complaining about it costing money, Be grateful they charge $30 for a lifetime pass, they could've easily made it $50-$60 and I would still pay.   Great app. 9.8/10"
5,benitoned,I like how it pops up to remind you to take the tests. Often it‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm ready to relax and sometimes after several drinks. Humbling to see how debilitating a few drinks can actually be
5,Mingolishes,"So far its challenging and keeps my mind working on problem solving. It may not always be as fun since it does get you thinking hard on some games, but its part of the challenge."
2,kathyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,It‚Äôs a great game for flexing the mind muscles but I don‚Äôt understand why I need wifi to play it. It just makes more sense to be able to play this offline because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm playing with other people. Very disappointing. Also the adds are after every game and sometimes twice in a row. I‚Äôd pay for ad free but because it required wifi it‚Äôs not worth it.
4,PIN3@PPL3,"This game is a really go way to find out things you might not have known. It also a good way to keep your brain sharp. I would recommend it to somebody that doesn‚Äôt know if they should get the game, it is not just a game but an experience and exercise."
5,Pearceyourheart,"I really like this app. It‚Äôs helping me train my brain for better performance. I like that it is challenging and helps me to focus more and helps me to concentrate to be more efficient.   I paid for a lifetime membership. I plan to use this every day to help build parts of my brain that I don‚Äôt often use.   It‚Äôs got great cognitive games to help train, relax, improve my brain functions.  Every day is different games. A must have. I am being challenged by brushing up my thinking skills, thanks to Impulse!"
5,App for Everyone!,This app is awesome you get to exercise your brain and get conclusions of what kind of person you may be along with finding out your in score etc. Everyone needs to try this out!!!
5,Wizzboy16,These activities keep my brain on point. During a free couple of minutes I work on these activities and get a true thrill challenging my brain.   Every should challenge their brain using apps like these.
5,G‚Äôma Rae,I am elderly and want to keep a functioning brain.  This app is definitely making me think.  I am enjoying it very much and look forward to the progress I hope to make.
5,Liz Jay,I‚Äôm always looking for something like this to do while I‚Äôm bored or waiting around for someone. I really like the games but the puzzles and tests are really interesting too! Definitely get it!
5,Roses üåπ üåπüåπ,Impulse has helped me to focus and work on areas that improve my ability to concentrate. It has allowed me to get rid of ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù. I feel more alert and have a greater ability to make clear observations.  Roses üåπ üåπüåπ
5,elizoegomez,"The app is like all of the brain games apps you‚Äôve seen in one. They are given in a systematic schedule adhered toward learning and growth. This is important because most app are productivity centered. This app allowed me to choose my intentions, I choose relaxation üòå"
4,GC is me :),"Love this so much. Great concept, amazingly helping people become smart. Everything I personally would really want to work on though is behind a paywall. I suggest makings at least one thing for each section free for all the broke nerds out here, but thanks for the app still!"
5,Olivia margret,"Ofc it asks u to join a subscription at first in support of the creators, but you can opt out. The games are cute and keep the brain busy from matching ghosts, and so far my favorite light sequence that has familiar backgrounds <3  not many ads either"
5,yassified ü§û,"This is the best app that has helped me with so much i needed to work on. I recommend 100% in my opinion, it distracts me from things i would rather not have attention on and is fun to play when im bored. This is the best visual learning for me!!"
5,Fnaf_Finatic,"Out of all the health apps I‚Äôve tried, this is definitely number 1. It helps you with all sorts of things while still including games! Most games are fun and can even be addicting at times!"
5,BD221456,Every body could benefit immensely from daily brain training and these games are fun and help improve your cognitive skills life‚Äôs a marathon never stop and exercising your brain if you don‚Äôt use you lose it
5,Danielll543267,"I love candy sort, completed all 800 levels without adding an extra tube‚Ä¶.except level 657.  Is this level possible to complete without an extra tube?"
5,SamWise2212,"I am recovery from a traumatic brain injury and this helps me strengthen my brain, it helps my memory and I can focus better and even respond quickly to math questions and such. It uses fun games to train your brain and makes it very stress free, it‚Äôs amaze balls üíú"
5,lou lou lou125098765,All other apps related to this one have many annoying issues that this app does not have. It‚Äôs fun and enjoyable and customizable to your needs. 5/5 all the way
1,keldel22,"I‚Äôve been communicating with Impulse support for over a month with no tangible results. I have to follow up with them once a week. No one will respond. I‚Äôve asked for my money back because the app has removed my entire history and will not redeem a purchase.   While their product is great, I will no longer use this app. There are plenty of over apps out there that do the same thing. Buy them instead."
5,samkeky,These games are fun and challenging. Bonus is you don‚Äôt have to wait till your energy refills and they don‚Äôt take a whole lot of your time either. Plus they help maintain brain function.
5,Bucket3337,I have enormous amount of enjoyment playing the games on this app.  Didn‚Äôt know you.l could find so much enjoyment and entertainment while improving your mind at the same time.  I highly recommend this app!
5,C_72,I like doing these because in just a few minutes of game play per day I‚Äôm exercising my brain in a calm and stress free way. I don‚Äôt mind the ads as that interruption allows me to have access for free.
5,Izzy081230,I Love this app so much I have improved so much ever since I started it. I love all the challenges it gives me and I‚Äôm 13 but it‚Äôs still so fun and it helps me focus and do math faster and other things like that. 10/10 totally recommend.
5,Therapist Ninja.,Love the variety and the areas it helps grow in brain functionality. Enjoy some more than others but the ones I need the most work on are tue less enjoyable. Lol. They encourage you and is not discouraging at all.
5,Klaudiavill,"Helps me give my brain a little challenge every day. I have long COVID and have been suffering from memory loss, these games have helped me keep my brain active and I do see a small difference in my memory"
5,ATcastle34,"The games are fun to play, very beautiful, and challenging. They challenge different areas I want to get better in, like mental math, attention to detail, and ability to sift through irrelevant information to find what‚Äôs important. Recommend!"
5,BadGalMaraj,"I am not much of a gamer in any fashion, but always love small little challenges like this and I find my every brain ‚Äúworkouts‚Äù to energize me in a way I‚Äôve never really experienced before! I love it so much."
5,Anne Jp,This app is so helpful when you fall into boredom somewhere but still want to be alert. I feel like I‚Äôm exercising my brain every time I go through one of the challenges which are like games.
5,CaseyLT8765,"It is mind stimulating as well as calming and fun so far. I am really enjoying it. I read the directions to each one without worrying if I will do well. Once I am in and I know what to do, I am calm and focused with fun and curiosity that I do well."
5,L3goEg0,I have been working on this every morning and it has really helped me with memory and focus. I am impressed with how well structured the app is and I really encourage others to try it.
4,sa3so,Great for mental exercise or even satisfying to the most intelligent brains. It should be free though if it was it would have 5 stars but the app lives up to what it would cost to pay and you can play all kinds of different games even if you don‚Äôt.
5,destin314,"Great games for the mind not only does it track your progress for you but you can track it yourself, where ever you want to improve it has games for you."
5,üÖ¢üÖóüÖîüÖ°üÖòüÖìüÖêüÖù,"Before bed when I want to scroll I play some games. My mental math has become faster, my problem solving skills has changed positively. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much but I received a lot of positive changes."
5,socks123az,I love this game! Each time I play it I feel my brain going into action to try and solve as many problems as I can correct. I love how I can challenge myself with each game working a different part of my brain.
5,RAE all caps,"I love sudoku, crosswords, trivia, palace card game, solitaire, minesweeper, etc.  I might be showing my age... or my intelligence. Anyway, this app feeds that part of my brain that loves showboating how much I know, how fast i am a thinker, and how well i execute under pressure.  Great app for smart people."
5,DiemMi,"Sometimes when it‚Äôs slow at work, on the potty or really bored where I‚Äôm at‚Ä¶. This is a great way to keep me from online shopping and keeping my mind entertained and sharp. Hopefully this will help me remember things better! üòÜ"
5,Prism715,I recently subscribed to Impulse‚Äôs brain workout to help with my memory and sharpen my mind as I am in the process of learning Japanese. There‚Äôs a lot of new words to learn and memorize. Impulse has been helping to test my brain‚Äôs memory which is just what I needed!
5,Trissy1986,"I saw this on tik tok and thought I would give it a try.  I really like how quick and fun these little brain quizzes are! Not time consuming, and help just add a little brain work out to my day!"
5,pop rock supporter,This app helps me so much!! I have less anxiety and over think less. This is something that makes me feel 100% better and more confident/ comfortable. I think you should definitely download it
5,Ariel savannah,The games are engaging and fun and keep you entertained while learning and training your brain. I don‚Äôt like how frequently you have to watch adds but it is what it is. So far no glitches or shutdowns and runs smoothly
4,BigBizAnt,"Since I‚Äôve started playing this app, I‚Äôve noticed that my headaches are minimal compared to the usual. Even playing while having a migraine has helped me! It‚Äôs a must try. I‚Äôm playing the unpaid version and the 5 second timer on ads helps keep me interested!"
5,TreeOfEve,"I‚Äôm always just sitting around looking at my phone screen and I can feel my mind getting dull , this game definitely keeps me entertained and on my toes with problem solving and memory, hand eye coordination and peripheral vision! I love it!"
5,Kick ty boss,"Definitely a good app, I haven‚Äôt bought the full version yet. I‚Äôm still playing around with the free games and so far I love them. I plan to come back and let everyone know when/if I buy the full version."
5,TheHumanCondition,"I definitely didn‚Äôt expect Impulse to be a good as it is! I have a hard time focusing and loose interest easily, but the way the games change and challenge you are surprising!"
5,Andrew202020,"The variety of games/puzzles is wide and they keep you engaged.  I just started using the app 2 days ago, but I can already see how this app does help train the brain. The exercises are created well."
5,Latino_Ice,I enjoy the format of the games. The scheduling and tracking features are great. The ranking after every effort is a very important feature. Special thanks to the team for this excellent product.
5,DavinaMH,"I am only 56 years young and sometimes forget things, but by utilizing this app‚Ä¶it helps me to improve my memory. And the great thing is that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are 8 or 88- it‚Äôs helpful and FUN for all ages."
5,Jenn_0070,"It‚Äôs my second day with impulse and I‚Äôm already a fan, I told my friends about it and they‚Äôve also downloaded, looking forward to all the daily exercises my brain will be doing!"
5,Lay lay _2drippy,This is such a great way to help your brain relax and learn at the same time. They know exactly what you need to help your mind nothing is better then learning my brain feels better than what it used to. So get this good
4,Redensmore‚ù§Ô∏è,"I‚Äôm not gonna waste real money on a video game, even this one! When I downloaded it, I thought it would be free and enjoyable!  But it‚Äôs not all free, most of the games that I want cost money and the games I hate are free! I‚Äôm keeping it for reasons  (And I really wish you could see your IQ and other test results, but nope!) Please try to fix it!!! And the adds, every single corner are some type of stupid adds! Anyway, God bless, and hope you have a great day! More to come if my opinion changes or I have more ideas!!!!!!!! Byyeeeeee!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,bw72472,Nothing like the others. It really gets your brain going. Some others I‚Äôve tried were too easy or just not what they claim to be. This one tops them all tho. You gotta try it.
5,pau g river,Im a college student who wanted to get better with thinking overall. I have had this app for a couple days and I feel challenged every time I play this app.
5,Tinanazee,"This game helps me to improve my brain health, they say. I can see how. I want to continue practicing so that I can score very high in it. I hope I can come back to this review to update the review of my newest scores. Now I score at 900. Thank God."
5,J hart74,This is helping me gain confidence and get better at the same time I would recommend any survivor with confidence issues to give it a shot and don‚Äôt let set backs be anything more than learning experiences.
5,shamrookali,The app has simple exercises to ease you into the program. You‚Äôll face different sections and play different levels of difficulty. Follow the mentality of improving by 1% and this could be a useful venture. Mastery and expertise can be learned.
5,RHWilliams,"I‚Äôve only played Impulse a few saysb but I really like it! The games are fun and provide a variety of activities that make me focus and think. However, they‚Äôre all very fun. I will definitely keep playing!"
5,k.ella,Its worth getting the app. Its fun and it gets your brain working. I like how it is customed to what you want to focus on. And again the games are so much fun but at the same time it does help you achieve what you want to focus on.
5,Rachelluv,It‚Äôs fun. It really doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre training your brain. You‚Äôre just like little puzzles and math and it really helps with your memory and everything. I love it.
5,Brinnlit,It‚Äôs like my ‚Äúget started‚Äù with my day. I notice better cognitive function similar to coffee in its stimulation when I play these types of games when added to my morning routine
5,ShadowPhx,"I treat this game like I‚Äôm working out my mind . Once you think of it in this way it will pay off even more and make it fun. I‚Äôm glad I found this app, one of the best apps out there for productivity and mental practice."
5,Soothing Sandy,"I love to keep sharp and this program definitely helps me enjoy the concentration. Nothing like having to work on a computer, doing on my phone and it‚Äôs enjoyable."
5,Mo3C,The test are pretty self explanatory. Not to difficult in beginning but hopefully it will once i start playing more frequently. Other than great training to keep the mind sharp.
5,56036 last samurai,"As I get older I realize that my memory is not what it used to be. Impulse helps me to work on my memory with fun and challenging games. Give it a try, at the very least you‚Äôll have some fun and learn a thing or two."
2,Lolapants,"I have a paid sub and have been waiting for updates to the games for months. I see people who have made the same remark back in March, and we‚Äôre told that more games would be released soon. That was 5 months ago. I just keep playing the same games over and over and honestly - THAT isn‚Äôt worth the price."
1,Realdeal*,"I saw an Impulse ad/ invitation on Instagram to take a personality test. When I looked for more info, I realized I needed to sign up for the free trial in order to take the test. So I signed up for the free trial and took their test, answering 72 questions. Only THEN was I informed I would need to pay for an upgraded subscription (??) just to see my test results. What a scam. Why not tell me that before? Because you want free user data, hm? This app has a real slimy vibe."
5,Morg of Salts,"I love the app; it‚Äôs perfect for breaks throughout the day, chock full of fun brain games and it lets you try many of the features before a subscription is require. So far, a 5 star app, very well done."
5,MirandaMHay,This app is great! Helps keep me on my A game and has helped improve my work performance being able to be more vigilant and has built stronger problem solving strategies. Highly recommend this app
5,ReadMe12,"I am a younger participant in this app, and I‚Äôve only had this app for 2 days, but it has been very helpful. All the quizzes are so fun, and I can‚Äôt wait to see the improvement in my brain from the really fun games and puzzles!"
5,PaperGirlAC,When games still feel fun while you are mentally challenging yourself- that‚Äôs a perfect combo. Easy to get into but you will get challenged. Really enjoy the variety of games as well.
5,th1016,This is a nice break from typical social media.  It challenges my mental focus and allows me to see my own personal skill level and where I need to improve my game.  It actually works the brain just like a bicep burn with a 12lb weight!
5,mhtfdfggfccvvc,"I have only been using this app for two days,  but so far it‚Äôs really helping me slow down and pay attention to detail in something I may be doing."
5,Rafamom,"It seems the creators of this game had someone like me in mind, starting to forget things and stuff like. This exercises have kept my mind sharp and on the go. Kudos for creating such and amazing app."
5,Koolaid2014,Only two days in but I have very much enjoyed the short but challenging games and puzzles. I also enjoy the tests and learning more about the way I process information!
1,7373644889425478,"This app tries to take advantage of people with impulse control disorder. Everyone scores high on their simple IQ test, and their ADHD assessment is an absolute waste of time. It could only be considered fun if you like winning simple games to feel better about yourself. Be careful. The 3 day free trial requires a 24 hour notice of cancellation before they bill you, thereby becoming only a two day trial. This was created by a grifter who likes to prey on people seeking mental strengthening exercises."
5,Brae S. 123,"I've noticed significant improvements in my retention and recall abilities, which have positively impacted my grades and overall academic performance. The app's features and exercises are tailored to promote cognitive growth, making it a valuable tool for students like me."
5,Santi_cali17,I wish we had apps like this growing up through school and it helps you lean more into extra curricular activities outside of school and helps you focus and helps me boost my dopamine levels and a release of stress
5,Light_codex,"I have a history of Alzheimer‚Äôs in my family, so I was looking for a simple way to integrate brain training into my daily tasks. Impulse is by far the simplest way to smoothly keep up the routine without being overwhelmed."
5,chicaflamenca,"Love this for a little mental break from work, a quick few minutes helps me focus in other ways, so when I do a game or two I feel more capable of finishing work with more focus."
5,BlossV,I don‚Äôt ever write reviews and it‚Äôs really rare I even use an app besides social media frequently. This has me hooked and I can feel the improvement it boosts me mentally. I‚Äôll probably subscribe to premium soon.
5,schwinningxoxo,"Fun games make it feel like you‚Äôre playing, instead of training. Gives you lots of information on how your brain works. As someone who is constantly stimulated, this works wonders."
5,cing0,This is an intuitive app for stimulating my brain. The quiz starts easy and seem to adjust to challenge my brain further. I can certainly do this for brain health over than trolling social media.
5,alivriwha,"Ever since I started using this I could remember things more thoroughly!  I found this app through a tik tok advertisement thinking it would be false, however I didn‚Äôt get fooled like the rest!  Seriously, get this app."
5,Ashes falling,"This app was FLAWLESS and really helped w memory, that is until one day it all changed and this app that I once used ad free suddenly became INUNDATED w ads at literally EVERY turn. And the thing that gets me is that I have a paid for version!"
5,Lori Eddy,Since playing my memory for day to day has improved greatly. It‚Äôs really helped with the frustration of looking for keys pens other issues with short term memory loss
5,StaceyStarüí´,Great way to keep your mind busy but not to think too much if that makes sense. When your trying to stay busy and not think but think about what your doing it‚Äôs a great way to do so.
5,U.M.I.S.G,I saw this game on tiktok and thought it would cost money and won‚Äôt let you play untill you pay but you can play even if you don‚Äôt want to pay and they have really fun games!!!
5,The Conquest,I like it because it challenges you to use your brain more than you usually would do. Giving you a good sense of what you want to improve on and stay focused and sharp.
5,Ghfbjgvjdcnhxvhscvj,"Super engaging, I‚Äôd imagine that this app would definitely will help with cognition if you used it religiously. Games are creative and sometimes even addictive. Beats luminosity and other brain training apps. Broad spectrum of exercises too. Good job guys."
5,liv robitzsch,"I‚Äôve just downloaded this app and really love it! You do have to pay for a premium subscription for an upgraded experience, but the free version with ads works well for me. Lots of ads though, be prepared!"
5,kid_ridiculous,"After watching my wife and our kids jumping up and down trying to beat the timer, i had to join them in the fun.   It keeps you sharp and concise.   Would recommend."
5,frackiejost,This app is helping me get my attention span back after deleting social media! It‚Äôs been great to see improvements on the app and in my life. Highly recommend if you like personality tests and learning your strengths and weaknesses.
5,9a,Crazy fun and a boost to my confidence. I don‚Äôt even notice the amount of work I‚Äôm doing on the daily workouts but find I feel more awake and alert after. Unlocking achievements is addictive.
5,jnevy04,Have been playing these games for only a few days and I already noticed the positive effects at work and when I‚Äôm doing a project
5,JD1223117,"Even on the free version, the games are varied, easy to understand, and pretty fun. The seven-day activity is easy to complete & I at least feel overall smarter üòÇ ads are present but not frustratingly common. Highly recommend!"
1,MECNov,"This app charges for every thing it offers. Separate charges for reports, etc. when downloading the app, if you refuse to select a payment plan- it will not close out to the initial landing page, it brings you into the app as if you selected a subscription, and then there is no way to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù it. Deleted the app right away and hope I don‚Äôt get charged.  If you want these tests- they‚Äôre available online for free."
3,sleezy operators,Games lose their interest when you get to a relatively low bar for a max score.  Certain games scoring is way off from others‚Ä¶  Premium is nowhere near worth it as there just isn‚Äôt enough content.  I‚Äôve finished almost everything and maxed scores out within a few days‚Ä¶.
5,rokurokudokugirl,"So many fun games that are free to play. All are unique and easy to learn. I started playing these games to help my social media addiction and now I‚Äôm addicted to this app! I‚Äôm not disappointed, considering on buying to skip the ads"
5,Ophelia 345,"I just started using this app, so far it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for: fun, challenging, quickly finish. Only one complaint is the free version has a ton of ads. We‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs worth buying. Time will tell..."
5,Ground To Crown Tree Care,I‚Äôm really enjoying this app! I find it‚Äôs a great way to spend some idle time instead of mindlessly scrolling random content that doesn‚Äôt really have any point to it. Thanks!
5,hay hay jayjay,I downloaded this app to see my own and didn‚Äôt find but that‚Äôs fine once I started playing the games it was really fun and easy for me to keep up .
5,232323232323232444445444454,i have only been using this app no for two days and I can already see . Difference only 3 games a day will make your mind shar share an answer do awa away me of the world around you
5,Big T1111,"Just started playing, but I can already tell this is what I was looking for from other apps and couldn‚Äôt find. Has a good array of things to keep the ol‚Äô brain sharp while having fun."
5,kyewhite5,"So far I‚Äôm enjoying the app and the way it‚Äôs making me think and test my brain. I‚Äôve only been using the app for 2 days, so we‚Äôll see how it goes further down the line."
5,Jaristi1,I just follow the training and having a good time playing the training games. They offered the right amount of challenge and looks well thought.
5,Krish_Miami,Highly recommend for adults especially those that would to function at heightened cognitive levels for work purposes
5,Ferncoll,I am a big phone game person so it‚Äôs nice to have an option that‚Äôs actually helping my brain while I either get ready for the day or wind down at night
5,Tlingit Girl,"I have been searching for ways to exercise and keep all cognitive skills sharp. Pulse does all of it and it‚Äôs fun. Strategy, Memory, and quick thinking. I really enjoy all the challenges and lessons."
5,Plaque smaker,Entertaining way to train your brain! I used to play candy crush to help me relax but now that I found impulse I find it is a way to relax while actually giving my brain a workout.
4,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅü•∞üòçüòã,I love it a lot it helps but I don‚Äôt want to pay because I won‚Äôt use the app a lot when I took the ADHD test it asked me to pay to see my result and I think it‚Äôs kind of harsh because it may be important but I have to waste money to see what‚Äôs wrong with me.
1,Polinski213,I wanted to test this out before paying I thought the lifetime subscription option would still be there after my my trial you know kinda makes sense but it was not! It doesn‚Äôt make sense to blindly pay for a product that you have no clue how will work. Oh well I guess the free trial is for me and I‚Äôll try a different app. Free trial has been fun so far!  Update they charged me after canceling my free trial! Don‚Äôt download!
5,religh catirina,"I don't use this app religiously, but if I paid for it I probably would. The games are fun and some of the test‚Äôs might be good for you to find things out about yourself."
5,12344555777789000???,Why like impulse is because there is barely any adds and in beginning you can choose what you want to work on and how you want your brain to be teased AND you can set goals for yourself.
5,Lawniee,This is only my second day using this app but I already love it. It is so fun to learn about your brain and what you need to work on and it‚Äôs also a good healthy way to spend your spare time on your phone.
5,TaylorDaCutieü•Ωü¶ã,"Just downloaded yesterday, can‚Äôt say what it helped with yet because i only been on my 2 day streak lol. it‚Äôs very time consuming & if it‚Äôs anything like it says it is, then time consuming is good"
5,cbkffhikkjfdt,I enjoy games like Sudoku and puzzles. I like that this app allows me to improve my cognitive functions but also keeps it fresh. There‚Äôs no burn out from playing the same games over and over.
5,5 star review for coins,I love this app it‚Äôs fun entertaining and I found myself playing this app a lot more than my other puzzle games!! Once he purchased the app sub subscription everything becomes really fun! it‚Äôs worth the $.
5,JustAnneMack,Saw it was 50% off for a lifetime subscription and its shaping up to b a great investment. Love the games! Gets my brain going and i‚Äôm excited to see how my development goes and the new games and challenges it has to offer.
1,appleuser2938,"I saw this on tiktok and signed up for a free three day trial. I canceled my free subscription after two days but they still charged me for a paid subscription. I asked apple for a refund and they refused. This makes me lose respect for anything sold on the apple store,  apple as a company and this app. Apple should remove it from the app store or give people the refund for this scammy app. I am afraid they will steal more of my money but apple won‚Äôt help."
5,Kaitbailey18,This app is so fun but so helpful! I‚Äôm definitely seeing where I need the most growth. They help you while making you feel confident with where you‚Äôre currently at as well. This app is the best!
5,Travis2229,I like howThe results are in a percentile range on my results to the game and my peers results to the game.I definitely want to beat any low test results I have and hopefully I won‚Äôt get better each time.
5,selfcowgirl,"I haven‚Äôt downloaded any type of game as such, so I found myself very interested and loving all the games and features it offers. I just started so will have to update on progress."
5,kimberly ochoa,Download this just searching up ‚Äúadhd games‚Äù and this is perfect. I needed a new app to be on instead of social media apps. But also wanted it to be good and interactive with my brain. This is exactly that.
4,sj lamb,Activities are engaging and fun and the app explains how each of them work to help you improve yourself in a meaningful way rather than tossing a bunch of games and tests up for you to play. They treat the why's like they're as important as the how's. Which is good because they are.
5,Marebearyum,"I really like this app. It explains the meaning behind each of the games. Some of the games are annoying. I dont mean annoying because i did not perform well, annoying in general. Hasnt stopped me at all :)"
5,Juanette13,The games are really fun you don‚Äôt even realize that you‚Äôre training your brain you‚Äôre just having a good time playing the games. I love the fact that they make you think.
5,Ravatotem,"Yeah, it‚Äôs just a good idea to get this on your phone. It‚Äôs not just a great time, but the challenges are fun and you learn a little more about yourself every time. Just saying, I don‚Äôt leave many reviews. This is a gem."
5,#WAFFELS,"This app is so fun. At first, i downloaded it only for the candy sort game, but the other games are so fun too! I like that the games help with brain training. I didnt expect this app to be so fun, but i am so glad i downloaded this app."
2,Sassy McSweetums,"The app is pretty okay, but the novelty wore off before my trial period was up. The subscription didn‚Äôt show up anywhere until after they charged me. I sent them a letter via the support tab and got no response. Only after the charge went through did the subscription appear on my iCloud."
5,Sue Claus,"Great brain exercises to get my day started. Being retired, I sometimes get into a ‚Äúzone‚Äù and do not feel like I‚Äôm giving my brain enough healthy exercise.  I‚Äôm glad I found Impulse. It‚Äôs been a fun way to exercise my brain."
4,annoyed greek,I never play online games or quizzes. this was bought on a fluke and I haven‚Äôt been able to put it down. it pretty much has everything imaginable including personality assessments IQ tests memory games etc etc etc  it‚Äôs awesome worth every penny
5,Cocklina,This is such a new and interesting way to train your brain. You hardly realize by playing the games that you‚Äôre training your brain tone younger than it really is.
5,Mr Gamer3275,Ok in my opinion Impulse is the greatest brain game in history because you learn interesting thing and also you can see what your own iq is and your personality mine was iq 123 and influencer was my personality I‚Äôm pulse is amazing 5 stars out of 5
5,aassddee,I‚Äôm 75 soon to be 76 years old. This type of interaction is good for us old folks. Give up the tv for a while and help yourself. So far I have done well but as you go the games get more difficult.  BJA
5,Kelrose22,I love it so far I haven‚Äôt had it long and it is so helpful and if you have problems with anxiety and depression it‚Äôll help you out with that as well! I highly recommend you getting this all!
5,Thebeststephanieperiod,"Amazing tool to use when have free time, it helps keep my mind sharp and to keep me from scrolling. I have learned about myself just in the first week I cannot wait to finish taking all of of tests.."
2,beet yeet,I downloaded this for the ADHD test for fun and it told me I have severe symptoms of ADHD but it it would make me pay to see the report but the thing in I already have the premium subscription. Why the flip would I have to pay even more which is already 6.99 A WEEK to see a report that‚Äôs not even official. Scam app for real.
5,st.clair12/4,"Honestly love this app. I‚Äôve had it for 3 days now and it really helps take my mind off stressful things and makes sure I‚Äôm not being completely mindless. And since it‚Äôs summer, I try not to get dumber so this helps"
2,LelaineDoesGhosts,"The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of one is because the app itself is very enjoyable, but the ads break the immersion. You already have a premium membership guys, you don‚Äôt need to also force people to pay to remove your ads. Or at least don‚Äôt make them after every single level of a game?"
5,Old Betts,This app is a great way to challenge the mind and stay sharp. I‚Äôm in my 50s and worried about cognitive decline. The games in this app keep me on my toes so my mind stays sharp and focused. It also helps me deal with my anxiety. The fact that it‚Äôs fun is a bonus!
5,Tresela Lee,"Absolutely love this app! Reminds me of playing Brain Age only better with a lot of different and fun games to help with memory, visuals, thinking fast, accuracy, and much much more! Sharpen them skills, you‚Äôll be surprised."
5,Kentucky KAGE,"Love the app! With a million things to do a day time for improvement is hard to squeeze in at times. Quick, fun games that supercharge the brain is just what the doctor ordered!!"
5,nycdude416,"Even though I found this app through an ad, I‚Äôve been very happy with it so far. Good variety, a quality build, and it feels like you get actual value from it."
4,Thatonegirl6239,"Wish there was a better free version, but this might be something I decide on purchasing later. On day 2 so we will see if it is worth it. Only thing I wish is a longer free trial so I can really experience all of what the app has to offer"
5,Mr.gameand watch,"Great games, I‚Äôm a developer I use this app to kick start my brain. The full version would definitely be something I would buy for a one time payment."
4,ROBLOX_LOVERRRR,"I would give this app a five, but I really dislike the fact that there are adverts with sensitive content in the app. I would really like you to see this and fix it, please. It‚Äôs been happening to a lot of apps I dont care about but this app?"
5,JesusJen,I love this app. The games are fun and really make you think. The ads are annoying but still it's worth it. I also like how it says how much better you performed than your peers after playing a game. It's cool!
5,ce!!33,"I like the tests, and enjoy the different types of games. I would only recommend they use the data and introduce new challenges and games as they learn what you need"
4,JDrive_03,"I enjoy a lot of the exercises even though they can be really easy at first, but once you go to higher levels they are challenging. It‚Äôs nice to give my brain a lot of practice with different puzzles and memory exercises."
4,tomboates,I love the app and would love to use it more but I lost my lifetime access when I had to make my secondary purchase account a separate family member. I emailed the support address on the website but never heard back. Can someone help me resolve the issue?
5,MooseVII,Found that using this app daily turns moderately strenuous challenges into fundamentally easy tasks. Simple 5-10 minutes a day has improved multiple aspects of my reoccurring mental strains.
5,Augrad02,I found this is a great way to start my day instead of  just jumping into work email   I feel like gets my brain going and I think better throughout the day
5,bearbqd,I‚Äôve tried a lot of brain game apps in the past and this is by far the best one I have ever seen. It is all encompassing for every type of training you could think of and helps you set goals to boot. I love it.
5,lestymarie2015,"I‚Äôve been looking for a brain training app for MONTHS, and couldn‚Äôt find a decent one then I saw an ad for this one on Facebook and so far it‚Äôs been amazing! Showing me what I can improve on keeping my brain stimulated!!"
5,LdeAnn36,I don‚Äôt have a good memory of previous events at all. I remember certain things but not everything.  I feel like this app could really help me get ahold of my confusions and memory loss. Providing great strengthened memory muscle.
5,alanna janes,I would actually consider paying for it but that‚Äôs just a little too expensive for my taste because I tend to get bored of stuff like that. But I have fun so who knows! Maybe I‚Äôll find it super worth it but
1,Twixxy Poo,"Every time I see an Ad for this I stop and download it because I want to play the games. The word free is very misleading because it‚Äôs not free, you have to subscribe. I just wish they‚Äôd make it known FIRST that you have to subscribe. But its probably better I just remember that it‚Äôs misleading each time instead of redownloading it and getting to the page where you have to pick your subscription type üòï"
5,rvrststr,"I‚Äôve been losing my memory and getting forgetful and I just started this program. Not sure if it‚Äôs helping yet but I do enjoy the games, especially since they are supposedly helpful and aren‚Äôt a time waster game"
5,Juliet Hickey,"I work in the medical field, for a cardiology office. I‚Äôve been trying to improve my memory skills and problem solving. I love the memory games and it‚Äôs also motivating me to practice while I am home and in the office. Helps a lot!"
5,lovesgizmo,"I‚Äôve been using this when I get the chance and it‚Äôs been a real help with stress, I love the games and daily workouts. I do wish you did have to pay for some things but all in all it‚Äôs a good app."
5,?boby?,Great fun. Challenging. I love the levels. Keeps me on my toes.  Kids play these games as they are developing and they become sharp. Adults seem to forget about brain games thus they slowly deteriorate in memory skills. These challenges help restore some of that.
5,Mangi Original,I really love this app because it engages my brain in ways I never thought possible. This is an easy and fun way to exercise my brain without having the strain of having to read boring complicated books.
5,Llllliikjutdj,It‚Äôs great that we can have an app that give us the opportunity to keep our brain abilities updated. Our brains are the most important part of our daily lives function.
5,Song365,"Really having fun and some challenges while working out my brain. I have a brain injury so anything I can do to help keep my functions and maybe be better, helps."
5,Tobeisthebestlol,Cheap as it is a yearly subscription. Really easy to navigate and has a bunch of challenges that are fun to play. Would recommend if your trying to become more intelligent and looking for something fun to play.
4,THANKS PJ,"Definitely an app worth getting, the games hardly feel like training but that‚Äôs the best part. I paid for the lifetime just because why not, so I don‚Äôt know what the other versions are like, but this one has so many activities I‚Äôm never bored"
5,ella far,i have really bad memory and stuff and the games on impulse have a perfectly personal games of what i want and u get to customize how u want it. It also helps me have something to do when i‚Äôm board
5,Theresa Engel,My memory has been pretty bad lately. I wanted ways to ‚Äúexercise‚Äù it. These challenges are fun and it kind of relieves stress in the process. I also like the option to pay once and that‚Äôs it.
5,Ice924,"Not to sound like everybody else but, This is one of the better brain training apps. i dont agree with the 6.99 a week. But i guess its worth it if your gonna use it daily. It helps you start your day off focused"
5,5784243,I enjoy this app a lot there‚Äôs a lot of creative/fun games to target multiple areas of cognition. Definitely a productive way to pass time!! Just wish there weren‚Äôt ads if you don‚Äôt pay the membership.
5,YourOleSon,This is actually really fun! I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy it this much. Although I don‚Äôt like all the ads they put that‚Äôs after every single game that gets really annoying but other than that I love it!!
5,MissTache14,I‚Äôve only been using Impulse for a few days but I‚Äôm really enjoying the concept. The games are quick and can hold my attention. I hope to see some increase in focus with continued practice.
5,BuddahBear,I‚Äôm finding these tests and exercises very helpful and difficult. But I‚Äôm pleased so far. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. Some tests and games have shown to be very beneficial to expanding your knowledge and hand eye coordination etc.
1,patriotpatty,I downloaded the app and tried the free trial for maybe 5 minutes. I then received a notification from my bank I had purchased a YEAR long subscription. I emailed the support email right away with no response. I waited a couple days and emailed again with an automatic response asking not to duplicate issues‚Ä¶ so I then wait 10 days and still nothing back from them. What a joke.
5,Authentic7!,I really enjoy this app because it has a great array of games ! I enjoy learning  and with this app it is opportunity to strengthen  my skills and reaction time .  It‚Äôs really helpful . Also is something healthy to do ! Awesome ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüìö
5,urmom‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢,I love this game so much! It‚Äôs helped so much already I feel accomplished. One thing is I wish I could add more time to my training but it doesn‚Äôt give me the option after I selected in the past.
5,$@veMe,"I really didn‚Äôt know where is going without this, I feel like I‚Äôm finding a new chapter in my life because of this app and the way it helps you find who you are."
5,PuppyChowcoxzp,When I downloaded it I didn‚Äôt know what to do and honestly thought I would delete and didn‚Äôt and now have it forever
5,MrCorazon,"Really provides a variety of games that test different aspects of mental acuity( focus, memory, attention to detail, etc). Plus- a variety of tests to analyze different aspects of self exploration. Really interesting app. Ive enjoyed it"
5,Cvhtsfhurfhjh,This app is challenging in all the right ways! Exposes areas of vulnerability in my thinking while mixing the right amount of content that makes me feel on target with keeping my brain sharp!
5,Jessica borden87,I like this game because it‚Äôs really exciting exercising my brain everyday and it‚Äôs only a few short games to keep u going everyday. It‚Äôs not like I have I spend all day doing it if I choose not to.
2,Ozzyrelius,"Too many ads mid-game so much so that I think I‚Äôm spending more time on ads than on the actual games. Disrupts whatever focus and engagement you gained from playing the games, that I see no benefit in using the app for free. And the paid schemes are way out of what I want to spend, specially since I had a bad time with the free version."
5,ALewis37,I have been enjoying these exercises and my kids have been participating too! It‚Äôs been interesting to see how different parts of my brain outperform or which parts need developing.
5,Nanz_1,I enjoy playing the games on this app the challenges really make you think and use you brain. I would definitely recommend purchasing this app.
5,jayhern,I love spending time on this app . Not only does it help me in many different ways but it‚Äôs also very entertaining I could spend an hr on this app and not even notice ! So much fun definitely recommend!
5,Ebola02,"Impulse is an excellent app to train your brain functionality in a wide array of topics and to improve with memory, speed, etc. I recommend everyone to give this app a try."
5,Slug stocks are expected,this review will be short but i‚Äôd like to say even for the free version and a couple ads here and there i live this app it has increased my focus time but a lil and i‚Äôve only used this app for two days or atleast i‚Äôd say i also like the mini games they have you can do daily and the ones you can do just for fun whenever you want and any to all of the time thank you creators for making this app and have a blessed rest of your day.
4,Ethan Edward,"Everything so far has been great. Paywall isn‚Äôt too expensive, especially if you buy for the year. The games are all fun and inviting and give me something to do aside from just scrolling endlessly on social media."
5,deuceit,"Impulse is a app that should be installed by default on every phone device something we scroll social media because of being bored or overwhelmed, well with this app problem solved."
5,Odysseus 14,"The first thing one uses while watching the examples is the linear as well as the vertical methods of solving the sequence of objects.  When using these methods of thinking, even the professional models become easier."
5,Meer904,"You dont even realize you are training your brain because the games are so fun!! Quick and easy and doesnt take up much time unless its you wanna keep going. Self paced, interactive & creative"
4,#awsome stuff,"I love this game it relieves stress and is fun. I love logic puzzles and games which is exactly what this is. HOWEVER, it costs a lot of money to get test scores back and they don‚Äôt tell you that until AFTER you‚Äôve done the 20-65 question quiz. This is the only reason why it lost a star"
5,Tamalero :D,"Really making me think, process, evaluate, resolve and better my reactions! I do recommend this app for those who don‚Äôt like playing games but do enjoy puzzles and critical thinking games."
5,Olliesmama31,"No complaints! I love playing the games and taking the tests, I‚Äôve only been using it for a few days but I can‚Äôt wait to start seeing a difference (or I hope I should say)"
5,primsheniece,"But if I had the money right now, I would definitely get a subscription. I love how the games make you think while having fun. And its a great way to releases dopamines, so I stay playing for a while.ü•π good app"
5,nobody60p,"So this game may have a bunch of adds, but it‚Äôs really fun and it‚Äôs good for you, most of the time I wouldn‚Äôt keep playing a game if I lost for a while, but this one gives the motivation to keep playing"
1,KRS373737,And it was good. Plenty of good games that I liked playing but recently they started putting in ads that took you out of the game and into the Internet automatically. It even happened during a level instead of between levels like it usually does. I don‚Äôt like that it can automatically open a website without my permission so I had to delete it.
5,"Susie,T",The games are varied enough to keep it interesting and feels like you are challenging your brain in important ways.  I am 67 and highly recommend this for my generation for certain!
5,MizzWatts,I love this game it‚Äôs helping me tremendously I started having issues with memory and within the last 2 weeks of using this app my memory is starting to improve
5,Naya102393,This is an amazing app. It‚Äôs fun AND functional. I love how the levels increase in difficulty and how the daily games switch up. Keeping it exciting.  I‚Äôm a mindset coach and I‚Äôd love to recommend this sooo to my clients as supplementary support
5,ghazaliee,This app certainly took my mind off of my anxiety and my stress so far I played 3 games and no ad interpretations and it doesn‚Äôt keep asking for you to pay so far love it
3,Cookingkristin,"I knocked off 2 stars because the app pushes you to upgrade to the paid version every step of the way and the ads feel extra long to annoy you into purchasing the AD free version. Feels aggressive and manipulative. However if you take away those hurdles, it's great and I like the games and exercises very much."
5,Pax Beth,"These games are so much fun, even though I am 60, they have a way of helping me to use my brain in a ‚Äúschool‚Äù way.. The saying ‚Äú if you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it‚Äù is true for the muscle called the brain."
5,Brain is brainin,The games are fun and I feel like they do make my brain work a little bit which is what I‚Äôve been needing as I feel like my memory isn‚Äôt great and Im not in school anymore.
4,Unique_chi,"I like the brain activities it makes me feel like I still have it. Now that I am getting older I want to start while I am young to continue to use my brain to reduce the effect of the saying, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it.‚Äù"
3,12289900,"So out the gate I love the app. Well at least so far. I love the different games, a lot of them are games I have played before just in one place. The different test are pretty nice but I really will just be using the daily Brian boosting games  What will keep me from using the app is the price. Plain and simple."
5,JoynerDD,It‚Äôs everything I need.  I suffered a massive lupus episode in 2014.  It resulted in spinal cord injury and brain injury.  I am also now in my mid 50‚Äôs.  I am always looking for ways to help myself get better and this for sure is a great way to start!!!  SO SO SO Grateful
5,Patrick Bravo MB,"I don‚Äôt have time to play many games on my phone, but these are not just games! They are engaging fun activities that bring a sense of fulfillment every time I complete each of them! I love Impulse"
5,DarfNader,The puzzles start out very basic but increase in difficulty as you play over time. Something about these games make them kind of addictive.
5,GringainFL,This is far better than many other games and puzzles. It is more functional and different from the normal games
4,wth322,"The app offers a variety of puzzles that don‚Äôt take a lot of effort to do but that stimulate ways of thinking that might not be used on a daily basis. It cost money after the three day trial, I think it‚Äôs 7$/week but don‚Äôt quote me."
5,tami666zx,"I do the free. I don‚Äôt pay for it yet has a bit of ads. But, I don‚Äôt mind. It helps me with this challenge games which is nice. Overall, this is a good app wounded how it is when it‚Äôs paid. I‚Äôll have to check that out."
5,Fl4koKilla,I have always tried other brain game apps but so far I have found that Impulse is by far the best and more fun of all they seem like games but have literally helped my memory
5,theylov_me,"I‚Äôve been obsessed with the little games, the whole experience is so much fun!! At first when I saw this on TikTok I knew i has to try it and I was right. This app is absolutely amazing and helps so much"
5,MissyBee13,I enjoy the entire setup of this app. All the games/puzzles are really fun and I can tell my skills are getting sharper. I am currently very happy with my decision to choose this one over all the others.
5,JareKen98,Very fun and creative way to keep your mind sharp. I‚Äôve been using it for a week now and look forward to the new challenges every day! 10/10 recommended this app
5,Leah Tenney,Tried this game and I‚Äôm obsessed! The games that  are for free are great and the daily games tell how good you are compared to your peers. Overall this is a great game and again definitely recommend!
4,Aubrey 101,The reason why I put 8/10 is the Impluse app is really fun but some of the stuff like an iq test you have to buy something to se the full report. I hate how you have to buy a lot of things for reports and adds and other stuff. Overall it‚Äôs a really fun app
5,Glorrila,I was so mad and I started playing the game and it helped me  release my madness so every time I‚Äôm mad or sad I‚Äôll play this amazing game ‚Ä¶ I love this game so much because it help my feelings. You should get this game if your an emotional person
5,cihcfcgyyf,"when it tells you that you should pay, its just so you can play more and you dont have any ads. you can pay or not it dorsnt give you any ‚Äúpremium‚Äù games!"
3,StethReb,"Regularly shows ads which have no way to close and force you to restart game. I understand supporting the game with advertising but this makes it unusable. Also, the puzzle game which was shown which first drew me to the game isn‚Äôt even available. This is a little frustrating."
5,Christopher M. P.,This app is really nice to get your mind off things around you! The only think I don‚Äôt really like is how you have to pay money to get rid of adds but other than that I love the app
5,ian mari,I was working with speed of memory and the app is pretty accurate with where my attention is although I have a sore thumb so need to use other fingers to tap . Otherwise Bingo!
5,Yeshhhhhsir,It‚Äôs a cool game and when playing you can obviously see what your struggling with. It also has many different cool things to see like how much better you are doing than others. It‚Äôs fun too!
5,BrownieBBYT12,"I think this app is so great because the games are really fun and addicting but yet they train your mind and make you better, where I feel like kitty many games can really complete that goal"
5,AshleyBehrendt,"If you‚Äôre going to play games throughout the day, you might as well exercise your brain. This app is a good way to take a break from the other stressors in life and really maintains your attention."
5,PBS stan,I really like this app. It challenges me without becoming overwhelming. I need to start using it every day because it‚Äôs not as scary as it might seem at first and I enjoy it
5,chr5tnR,I really enjoy using this app when I have spare time. Kind of annoying that it‚Äôs a weekly subscription but I think I get my money‚Äôs worth from the yearly plan with how much I use this app.
5,Don_Nogueda,Very helpful and very much what I needed to keep my brain sharp in todays day in age where  scrolling is unlimited and losing focus is everlasting. I‚Äôm glad to find something that helps me reel my mind back in and perform at my best on a daily basis.
5,Zello ZTPNGV,I appreciate everything these developers are doing I enjoy the gameplay and the day to day progression I‚Äôm making as a person because of the app Thank you   Worth checking out and investing in
3,RacerDudeeee,"Very cool app with fun games and challenges but I deleted it after an hour. After every single challenge I got an ad‚Ä¶. I get it, you need the revenue for being free and opting to not pay the subscription but holy moly‚Ä¶. Chill on the ads and more people would keep the app and you would in turn make more ad revenue."
5,shanynate14,I like this app because it helps me to concentrate and learn new skills. The games are entertaining and great to play. I recommend it highly. You won‚Äôt regret getting it. It has all the games you love and more.
5,Joe McIncome,"Just a working stiff, idk about if it actually does anything beneficial, but it is a fun little thing to do, and make yourself feel smart, and if it does help, than there‚Äôs that too."
5,KurtNoykos,"I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 weeks. It‚Äôs hard to say a few brain games a day is directly related to memory, sleep & depression; but it‚Äôs not hurting anything! I‚Äôll take the little uptick before the winter months & SAD!"
5,grsx bklm vddwqsxh,This is the type of challenge I was looking for.  You have to think fast and since you are timed it adds that element of pressure that either you stay cool or you lose it!
5,L.A Rock management,Really enjoying It. I‚Äôve only done 4 days and I just completed some work tasks today that had previously had me stumped for 4 months! Did I get smarter?   I love the games to expand my brain and also the IQ tests.
5,brandon111133532,it helps to know that even when you are just ‚Äúpassing time‚Äù you can be doing something so productive and helpful for your body. It feels like you are actually nourishing your brain.
5,Pings78,"Love this app, at 44 I‚Äôve been wanting more than reading to keep my mind sharp and this has been the answer gives me something fun to do and helps with focus and great exercise for the mi d definitely recommend!!"
5,some 11 yo yo,"I really like this app because it‚Äôs not like others, it has multiple categories for the things you want to work on in your brain such as memory, quick math, and sorting!!"
5,Liz1545,"This is the first app that I‚Äôve come across that actually gets me excited to exercise my brain! If you‚Äôre experiencing brain fog, stress, lack of motivation etc., download this app! It‚Äôs a huge dopamine booster"
5,shaabrams1975,I enjoy this app it allows me to actually work on problems I haven‚Äôt done in forever and it keeps my mind going. I always say if you don‚Äôt use it you will lose it.
5,(„ÜÜ _ „ÜÜ),"This app is great. The IQ tests are the reason I downloaded the app, and I feel that they are challenging and accurate. The mental exercises are fun and keep my brain sharp. The games are also satisfying to complete. Overall, I love this app and plan on continuing to use it!"
5,Da72685,"I absolutely love this app! But, I‚Äôve been stuck on level 107 in the Candy Sort game for over a week now. I don‚Äôt think he level is meant to be passed! About to delete the app!"
5,Periwinklelly,"Impulse is a great game! It helps me focus and it is also just really fun. There are not many ads, which is nice too. Most of the features can be unlocked without purchasing them. I don‚Äôt have any complaints!"
5,Brainstorm12.2,To be honest I didn‚Äôt think I was gonna enjoy it as much. Turns out I needed to work out my Brian as much as I work out my body. I was extremely rusty on every day activities. And this really got the ball rolling for me .
4,JuJu977,"This app lets you choose how frequently you want to use it and gives quick mini games that help improve certain aspects of your mind. I love how it doesn‚Äôt force you to pay or pester users to log in, 4/5."
5,adsfgdjaltovpp,"I am not a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù and these are actually fun, as well as relaxing. I look forward to my ten minutes of brain games before bed nightly to help me decompress after the long day."
3,dyrule,"the initial free 30 day workout of this app is amazing! i loved playing each game every morning. my only problem is that after, this did not restart and i could not go back and do it again without manually pressing each game. while you needed to watch an ad before each anyway(which i agree with as it‚Äôs the free version), you are prompted to do so ‚Äî making a redo of each day tedious when it‚Äôs the same exact system as before.  my only request is to reset the 30 day challenge after it is completed. i don‚Äôt even mind the same games as the previous, as long as it differs each day."
5,Funky_Shadow,I love other mind games app as well but this one has everything in one with graphics that keeps your interest up all the time.
1,CSI Rocks!,"After answering a bunch of questions, you get to the end and it‚Äôs immediately asking for you to pay or to try a free 3-day trial. The moment I saw that, I exited and deleted the app.  Things like that usually ask for information and start charging you even if you cancel. For something that gives fun tests, etc you don‚Äôt need my info and once they get it, it‚Äôs hard to refute charges. No thanks."
5,Marissazf715,"I enjoy small puzzle games and always have. For me, if I‚Äôm bored, this definitely helps break up the monotony. And the different tests available are fun from a psychological analysis aspect - highly recommend :)"
5,Lamaj2424,"Impulse is a great way to keep the brain sharp. Instead of scrolling randomly online, impulse allows you to develop in many areas mentally that can translate into your daily life."
5,NnjC101,I really like the amount of different categories of games. I enjoy the daily challenges and can see how this will improve/impact my brain from decline. Its worth the fee to subscribe. It‚Äôs gaming with a purpose.
4,Nancy H Itunes,I am adhd and struggle to keep focused on tasks. This is easy to work on for short periods and I feel it‚Äôs improving my focus and ability.  I struggle to pause a game when being interrupted by a call or pet interruption.
5,Virago76,"Even though a lot of the exercises ‚Äúseem‚Äù rudimentary, they are actually quite stimulating as far as focus and cognition. The short duration of each exercise keeps you easily engaged."
5,jay.hipster,It‚Äôs absolute fun like the colors and the simplicity of it makes it feel like a game that you wouldn‚Äôt want to give up on and it challenges you to beat your previous score
5,zzzzzzsssssssd,This is actually fun while your still testing your brain skills to see how well your memory still works and see if you retained what you learned back in school
5,hannak09,My memory has improved quite a bit I didn‚Äôt think this would help but the things that I have been improving on is great
5,Effie Angel,I love this app! It has been helping me through this dark time in my life going through the death of my brother. I do see a difference in myself !! Thank you so much for creating such a great app
5,larren lee,I was curious about myself and wanted to find out more about how my brain works so this was an interesting app for me to use.  So far it‚Äôs been really helpful and interesting
5,Coptic ghget,This app actually has the games advertised and so much more. It‚Äôs super fun and so many options to choose from for games to play. Really good and you‚Äôre improving your brain!
1,RosieAus,"I looked into this app because of an FB ad, thinking it could be a decent time killer with its puzzles and tests. However, I immediately got their subscriptions shoved into my face. When I opted to skip paying, every little action was met with a long ad. And at that point I‚Äôm not going to bother fighting through ads just to see if this is something worth paying for."
5,ZizAziZ,never thought i would enjoy these type of games/ activities. specially when they forced it on employment assessments.   i wish the price is less though.
5,Hawk_lord01,After being diagnosed with ADD a friend recommended I try out impulse and it‚Äôs been great at helping me try and keep my brain on track and help me improve in areas I want to improve in.
5,alannapisces,"This is a series of brain training games that are sometimes scary before trying but turn out to be fun and make me want to do better. However, I don‚Äôt believe in timing or even measuring intelligence."
5,courty23!üíöüíô,Definitely recommend for someone who is looking to keep sharp! Gives me a daily break and the ten minutes to myself leaves me feeling better for the day.
5,Mariam_10,Not only do you improve several cognitive skills but you have fun while doing it! Very entertaining and informative. I look forward to my 10 mins/day training sessions with excitement.
5,sandraLhuels,"I just started playing, but this app has been fun so far. I am trying see if my cognitive functions improve. I will come back and update my review after I‚Äôve been playing awhile. Thanks üòä"
5,Hekeocnfnjwoznxur,100% would recommend to everyone! I‚Äôm so grateful for this app as it has helped me understand myself better whilst challenging me to sharpen my brain skills
1,Miss Portinari,Says I have a three day free trial and after I‚Äôll be billed.  So why isn‚Äôt everything unlocked with this free trial? Why am I constantly being pressed every thirty seconds to subscribe to an annual plan?  Obnoxious. Just incredibly obvious greed given you can‚Äôt even let people try your app without asking for money nonstop. You lost me as a customer because if you hadn‚Äôt done this I might not have cancelled before I could be charged.
5,BFdalover,This app is wonderful. I do sessions three times a day to make sure I keep my mind sharp throughout the day. I like the games and problems the app have as well. It‚Äôs definitely worth it. üëçüèæüëçüèæ
5,Yearlette Taylor,It has been less than 24 hours since I have been using this app and I am pleasantly surprised. I can tell that my cognitive function is being expanded and exercised.
5,S Bree,"Love, love this app!! Usually I don‚Äôt play games on my phone and honestly never find the time either. Something said to try it out and I love it! Challenges my mind and gives me a since of clarity."
5,Fun but‚Ä¶there‚Äôs this thing,"Tired of games and all the ads other than that it‚Äôs fun, just miss the days when we could download an app and play it without being bombarded with nonsense constantly"
5,juper012482,Impulse brain training is an engaging and interactive program that I find highly enjoyable. It not only provides entertainment but also helps me sharpen my focus and prepare myself for the challenges of the day.
5,Trini mom of 2,This game is exactly like advertised! So many time you get tricked into buying something just to find out it‚Äôs not the type of brain games you expect. This is what I saw and more. It‚Äôs fun and challenging
3,maryjanewatson,"The relaxation games like candy sort, connect the dots, and robotic flow need more levels! They each say more levels are on the way, but i finished these months ago and still no more have been added. This is the only game app I‚Äôve ever subscribed to, and it‚Äôs becoming not worth it"
5,mason578568,"Keeping my brain  on alert.  Exercising all the capabilities and function of your mind.  The app has tests, puzzles, and games to keep you interested and coming back for more."
5,mommyof3girls2020,I just started this app a few days ago. I think it does have the potential to do brain training over time for sure.
5,Ocasio,This app does make you use your brain. Just started so still on the easy ones and looking forward to the levels ahead.
4,Tasha Banks 04,Got this game for my husband because he had a stroke nearly a year ago. I  am hoping to help rebuild his memory and cognitive abilities by using games like this. I also downloaded it for myself so he won‚Äôt be in this alone. So far I like it for the both of us.
5,DteresaT,I‚Äôve done many brain training apps and this is by far the best.  It‚Äôs held my interest far longer because of the number and types of different games and challenges.
5,JCT_104,"It‚Äôs a nice and fun way to exercise your brain without complications, the app is super user friendly and I highly recommend it. I love it! Don‚Äôt waste your time playing dumb games, instead keep your brain sharp!"
5,Moma Monroe,This is a very cool app. I just paid for the Life Time thing. I‚Äôm starting my day with different exercises to wake me up more. I‚Äôve been joyed it so far and will update after I have more time with this app.
5,Sorge9,I am a senior and thought that my memory was failing and beyond improvement. I have slowed with age but Impulse has made me realize I am better than I thought and will improve with continued learning.
1,DaylynM,This game has been taking money out my account for the subscription. I‚Äôd be better for an option to pay the subscription or if I don‚Äôt pay it can cancel my subscription until but NO it just automatically take money out your wallet an doesn‚Äôt even tell you. This was horrible and never getting again. I want my refund ASAP I and I mean it!!!!üò°üò°
5,Dusty Girl 2015,"I don‚Äôt know if this is one of the benefits others get, but it seems my concentration has improved just from using this app a short time.  I‚Äôm loving it so far.üòä"
5,vckjcncfnciknicd nlovxf,For times I find myself aimlessly scrolling I will go on this app instead and do things that actually improve my ability to think faster and reduce stress
1,App awesome!,If the ad that came on while I was using this app had come on when my son was playing I would have had the heads of these developers. Unbelievable that an app advertised for 4+ would allow very graphic adult content without a warning or option to disallow for age group. I feel violated for having even seen it. Huge thumbs down. Very disappointing.
5,Jung_cooks,Impulse is an amazing game that helps your concentration and anything else your looking for. Even without paying you still get many benefits witch are amazing!! 10 out of 10 recommend!!
4,Lil-CEAK-ChANcE,This app makes my brain work harder than it has in a while but I also set it for a harder level than I needed and it works a lot I‚Äôm so serious I can‚Äôt thank this app enough for how much it‚Äôs helped me these past few days!
5,SuzieFrogASL,Playing games that help train your brain instead of indulging in mindless garbage or negative content- it‚Äôs a total game changer. Everyone should use this. Incredible. I may have to upgrade! üòçü§üüèº
4,crackedpepperginger12360,I think this game is very brain activating with adhd and it did help get my brain a little active and some games I liked more then others but I wreak I liked the game and would recommend it for some who are bored or have bad adhd and can‚Äôt focus very well
5,PINK CHAIR,The challenges presented are very enjoyable! No annoying sound effects. Just plain fun. I especially like the daily reminders. Those keep me on track to get better at the task presented.
5,This-Is-How-I-Rock,So I use impulse and it is very hard for me to focus and concentrate in class so when I heard of impulse I decided to give it a try and it worked so parents let your kids do impulse if they can‚Äôt focus.üòçüëçüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èüòéüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
5,rcalli1034,This app makes me feel like spending time on my phone isn‚Äôt just a waste. It‚Äôs entertaining and also challenging. I‚Äôm a competitive person so it‚Äôs fun to see how I‚Äôm doing against others.
5,Toreto05,"This app has way too many LONG ADS, plus you have to pay just to unlock things!!! Waste of time downloading this app."
5,vwspeed03,The best brain game out there! I especially like the information that it provides back to me on how I stand up to the other users after each game/test.
5,KitTITass Cunty,For me apps like this end up being either really annoying or really boring. so far I have actually enjoyed using impulse and plan to continue so long as this remains true.
5,Miss Troll,"I like this game, if I had extra money I would pay for the premium but the free version is good enough for me right now! It has a lot less ads than other games which is great! Love the exercises too!"
5,CAMS134,With a wide variety of games from easy and distracting to challenging. I find I‚Äôm spending much less time on the socials and have enjoyed trying to keep a streak going.
5,Cristy.Rod,This app allows you to have fun while stimulating your brain. Impulse also brings out my competitive side. At the end of each game it lets you know where you landed compared to your peers.
5,tatntude,"I‚Äôve been using this app for just two days so far. I love it so far. Given a bit more time to truly see any results, I then will come back with a more detailed review."
4,CabooseConsumer,It‚Äôs a fun way to exercise your brain. Games and activities are tailored to the areas of your brain YOU want to improve. The only thing I‚Äôd change is maybe give a week long trial or maybe two weeks rather than just 3 days.
5,KotaBlueDoe,"Honestly even though I just installed it I already like the fact that it didn‚Äôt force me to pay , I really like the set up of the app, the design, choice of colors, and the games."
5,nicdmaster,It has a variety of options and really does help and if using a membership its beyond useful what's 30 a year for a more productive mind you make that back and beyond then some it's price is a steal
5,julieebaybee,"Love this app! It challenges my brain and helps me practice in the areas I am weak in. Over time my problem solving skills have improved, as well as my memory. Wonderful app! Would definitely recommend!"
5,Ash68BooBoo,"I am 28 years old and I don‚Äôt normally play games or read or anything like that, but this game gives me all of the above and its fun!! It makes me try to do better and better each time to beat score"
5,Pierre Jr.,I enjoy brain games and this app has a variety of different brain games. They slowly progressively get harder which is awesome so you don‚Äôt get bored once you get the hang of it.  Highly recommend.
5,MusicallyInTune,I am glad I can keep gaming but actually so something connected to bettering myself as well. The IQ test are awesome also. I brought the yearly subscription after 1 day. I loved it that much.
5,paddingtonk,There is a large variety of games and puzzles. There are also a lot of programs to do each day/week to keep thing interesting.
2,MauiGuy57,"The actual brain games & tests are wonderful, there are just waaaay too many ads, and they are super long.  Literally get a 30 second pop-up after every game you play.  This is obviously done on purpose to push people into paying the monthly/yearly ad free option.  Unless you plan on paying for the subscription, don‚Äôt waste your time."
5,zaireto,I like impulse so far! Since I‚Äôm too lazy to pay for the full thing I just started with the free part but it‚Äôs nice and I like it! I feel the burn already! Or maybe something is actually burning üòÖ
1,hhhsgdferrteyyhdh,This is a free app to download and I know it says in app purchases but I started the IQ test and it gave you 20 minutes to finish. When I finished it wouldn‚Äôt give me the report without signing up to be aPremium member. When I hit the X it‚Äôs at oh you don‚Äôt want to be a premium member get your report for $4.99. this is a joke. Companies like this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to sell their product on this marketplace without full disclosure.
5,hlensnanf,"As someone with attention issues, ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù provides both the right structure for my brain, and is fun and aesthetically appealing. It‚Äôs a wonderful, well-rounded app and I‚Äôm so here for it.  Aka I think it‚Äôs worth it, and I think you will enjoy it too."
5,DV929,"So far so good, only thing is you have to pay for the other games, which I get it‚Ä¶ but I feel if it had a few more ‚Äúfree‚Äù mind games, it would take it to the next level!"
5,Mai Jade,This is a fun way to challenge yourself. I‚Äôve come to find out I‚Äôm smarter in places I don‚Äôt give myself credit in. And also finding that the places I thought I didn‚Äôt need practicing needs practice ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,nickelsak,"It‚Äôs a very helpful app, I really am awful at math and the fact it‚Äôs helping me with that Is amazing!ü§© I love the mini games they have it just takes my mind off of everything and focus and relax, That‚Äôs all I need in life atp <3"
5,Sekhmet!16,Today was my second day playing the game and my anxiety has minimized.  I love how it makes me use my brain compare to social media platforms that have 0 productivity unless promoting a brand or product.  Love this game
5,Xiao is emo,"I thought i would drop it after a while but it has good games along with free brain training, plus you can take an iq test along with it? I cant thank the devs enough"
4,nadine427,It exercises my brain and helps me realize things about myself I didn‚Äôt know before. It‚Äôs a good app the only thing that could be better is the price. I‚Äôll probably delete it before it renews but if it was free I‚Äôd definitely use it every day!
5,ShottyBughatti,Honestly it‚Äôs a fun way to get your brain working. Personally I like it cus it‚Äôs distracting and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm just wasting my time. Does a great job at explaining the games instructions. Overall a cool way to challenge yourself.
5,MentalDeficit,I love this. It‚Äôs really helping my mind power but I hate that I have to pay so much for it.  I have a lot of financial issues but need to build my brain power with the mental issues I have.  I do love it and it works great
5,Arxilla,"I struggle with memory and focus, this app has helped so much! It also lets you choose a time you want to be reminded which is great because if there wasn‚Äôt I would forget. Love this app totally recommend!ü§ç"
5,ChrisW12345,The app is well designed and the games are challenging. Looking forward to seeing how long I will stay interested in it. Hopefully the devs keep adding new things as time goes by.
4,uclfykgdyffjfkdykcvu,I am so exited this helps me get smarter and soon I‚Äôm going to be the smartest kid in class. Totally recommend!!! I love how it gives you different games but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the ads or how you only get a specific time to play each day but over all this game is awesome must try!!
5,I am so mad (read bottom),"Impulse is an amazing app were you could train you brain everyday! Impulse includes test, example: personality test and includes games to help train your brain to do stuff you would like to do. I recommend 10/10."
5,BrucePDX,Great app for a quick exercise and focus on brain stimulating activities. use it daily and look forward to focusing my attention and exercising my brain. Highly recommended.
4,slowjeremy,The games aren‚Äôt addictive. You don‚Äôt want to keep doing them. You only keep doing it bc it‚Äôs supposed to help your brain. The tests are cool but you may realize some things about yourself you do not enjoy. But that means room for improvement.
5,ZibbyMiles,This is great for mental health. It has many different exercises for many different topics.  It rates all levels of the mind so you can see where you need help and where you excel.  Very interesting!
5,_ellapup_,"It‚Äôs fun and good for your brain.  Instead of spending time scrolling through angry posts or silly videos, this keeps you entertained, challenged, and helps you in the long run. Win win I say üòÅüëåüèº"
4,Busy_B23,I have enjoyed impulse app since the very first day. It has pretty good challenges that keep my mind alert and I start to notice the difference in my memory. Impulse has many different ways nd types to keep your cognitive skills in pretty good condition!
5,Kiersten+Brian,"It is challenging but not in a way I don‚Äôt want to keep doing it! I always wanna try again and keep doing the next challenges , I also love leaving about myself the more I do it!"
5,elliottdday,There are so many different ways to train your brain with this app. I‚Äôve been using it for more than a year now and it‚Äôs never let me down. So glad I got the lifetime pass.
5,Joesbabe,If time using an app like this.  Enjoying the challenge and change of pace. Thinking of making the purchase.
5,WhoDeanie187,"I like this because it‚Äôs fun, and it shows me what needs improvement along with helping sharpen my skills and helps with my anxiety, attention, brain overall l! I highly recommend this"
5,crowcindy13,I purchased this app to play the puzzle games to see if I was a genius lol. Little did I know it could help me improve my math skills. I hate numbers a little less with each math game it gives me to ‚Äúplay‚Äù.
5,Annie Sant,"I recently had a brain scan and it needs a lot of work. This app has installed a sense of fitness, and the fitness makes me feel like I can achieve the rehabilitation that my brain needs."

5,TephanyH,"Coming from a sober, living home being an addict my mind has been completely out of whack. This game has literally changed my thinking my focus on a lot thank you and pulse."
5,Nicodemus 1,What to do in each game becomes perceptibly more challenging without making me feel like a dunce. So far so good.  Round 2 Something went wrong in my thinking but as an American I will bounce back and overcome adversity!
5,vdvfjfcsf sad hhbdvyxg,I like this game so far makes me feel a little bit sharper with each challenge. Definitely recommend if you want to strengthen your brain or even learn yourself more.
5,Petey_BOD,I enjoy these games so much I‚Äôm always looking forward to playing them again and again.
4,Noel_lanson,"I was expecting a few features to be available because there was a monthly plan but it actually has a bunch of free features you can do, but you have to watch an add liek every 2 or 3 test so that‚Äôs not fire but yk >:,( good game though"
5,Lama17831,I‚Äôve been using the app several days and so far and enjoying using it Fun little games that aren‚Äôt too long but make you concentrate and exercise the brain.
5,Dummynnbbv,I've never tested a brain training app and since I have used this one I have loved it this app makes trading your brain fun and challenging you should definitely download this game
3,aqua marien,"It a cool game, but when you put the word free on a game app whatever app it is. It should be free, not tell people after it explains what the app is and ask questions. I don‚Äôt really recommend it unless you like spending money on apps that ask for money."
5,G-Lo Rich,Just started today. I‚Äôm thinking this is going to be good for me. I‚Äôm 60 years old and I‚Äôm concerned always about my memory because my mother had Alzheimer‚Äôs.
5,DezzyPurp,It‚Äôs an interesting app that is highly interactive and creative throughout any challenge they put you through in order for you to be a better you.
5,Friscogurl808,I‚Äôm enjoying using impulse. I appreciate the reminders. At first the notifications were just one more distraction but when I make the effort and play the daily games I feel accomplished. Loving it!

5,PrincessAeileita,So far I have actually been enjoying this game. It‚Äôs challenging but it helps a lot. I like all the different features in the pro mode because there‚Äôs more that I can do and play
5,Doode37,This app is soo refreshing compared to all the other mind numbing social media apps. Just use this app for a few minutes every day and your brain will thank you.
5,Elsey maylor,"Highly recommend brain exercises of any kind, but this app is better than a lot of the ones I‚Äôve tried."
2,J Alexandra,I get that you need to monetize the app but the ad playing after every 1 minute exceecise and having ads you can easily click out even 30 seconds after they start is ridiculous. Don‚Äôt bother downloading this app unless you like  a ton of the same ads over and over again!
5,buymyway,"Just started playing. I‚Äôm really enjoying the various exercises. They are stimulating and fun!  I have learned, however, that I shouldn‚Äôt wait until the end of the day to playüòâ"
2,M. Ford,App is extremely pushy to purchase a subscription. You can‚Äôt even complete one quiz or two clicks without them begging you to subscribe. Got this fully intending to use it and wanted to try it out before committing but Jfc it‚Äôs annoying. I had it for about five minutes before I was frustrated and deleted the app.
5,Rbinacooks,"Love this app. It‚Äôs really helpful in making quick decisions and it‚Äôs actually fun in the process. I‚Äôve had or having a health problem that‚Äôs terminal so anything I can do to stay sharp and focused, I‚Äôm all in!"
5,cordiddle,I‚Äôve only been using impulse for a few days but I really enjoy the brain games it has to offer and hope to see improvements soon with my memory!
5,MrsMac2022,"At 54, I wanted something different to play on my phone that would challenge my brain and help keep me sharp and quick. This  app is just the right balance of difficult and fun!"
5,Neriyah jean,It‚Äôs great for the brain and all these excercise improve are accuracy the challenges we face I personally love it for school work even tho it‚Äôs summer but I still do school work download this app and you will have a great time
5,Brandymit,I have only been using the free version of this and have loved it! Many of the puzzles are similar to what I do with my gifted students and they cover many different areas.
5,Mamaw1720,Impulse is a great app to have to challenge your mind! Helps to keep you more focused and you can test how quickly your brain takes in information! It‚Äôs an app worth the download
5,Tori number two,"There are not a crazy amount of adds like most games when you don‚Äôt pay for premium, plus the games are pretty fun and do help your brain grow!"
5,roritoocool,"This app is very user friendly, as someone who doesn‚Äôt have the subscription the advertisements are bearable and the games are fun and help my brain skill levels. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun brain game, and very addictive!"
5,Alphoria,I got the free trial just wanting to improve my memory. On day two and the apps still keeping me engaged and wanting to do more. Would recommend to others for sure.
5,Cheyfire,"I like there are multiple games every session. You can spend 5 minutes to 6 hours with these brain work games, they are fun, challenging, and could be addicting for some"
1,Greenftw,This app isn‚Äôt free and it‚Äôs very expensive ( even though they let you ¬´ get lucky ¬ª by giving you and everyone else 92% off in the first 2 mins (maybe you do need brain exercise if you can‚Äôt see through that..) The games don‚Äôt function properly either (candy in the tubes.. don‚Äôt move the candies you select? Huh?  This is my first App Store review because this app really was the bad.
5,phugnuton,I feel re-energized and better focus after just 3 games!   I also like the option to buy the game outright and not just subscription.
4,Allstar Jones,"Didn‚Äôt pay for the subscription since the ads are only 15-20 seconds long, but all the games keep me engaged enough to wait. Enjoy seeing how I compare to others playing the games as well."
4,Makemesmileonce,"This is a great way to feel good about what you can accomplish with your brain, the reason for the 4 stars is because after each game you have to watch another ad‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs annoying, but still a great game!"
5,rckclimber4life,This is a game I need to play everyday. I can see it helping me with my memory. I've been looking for a game that's not only going to take my mind off of my problems but also help tremendously with my memory.
1,RPenman66,"I clicked on the 3 day trial.  It wouldn't allow me access unless I clicked what plan I wanted.  Have had other apps do the same thing.  You just have to cancel before the end of the trial if you don't want to continue.  Well I did that and it pushed it through as a purchase not trial.  Sent message to developer, and disputing with Apple.  Disappointed it would charge me rather than do what it was supposed to."
5,Gogokatie,"At first you‚Äôre like, oh I got this. And then you play and realize how impulsive you actually are. I love each test, puzzle, etc. Especially the tests that help you understand your personality & emotional intelligence more."
4,Damaged RN,"I suffered a severe neurological reaction from the Moderna Vaccine, complete with seizures and brain damage. I have lost my ability to work, and everyday activities often cause uncontrollable body movements. I am working hard to repair my brain and I think this app helps a lot! Thank you! Worth the price for me."
5,youpickyhenickname,Impulse is fun because it includes difficult levels.   Some almost seem too hard!  I enjoy the challenge.  I couldn't believe I got an ok/even good score on some levels.
5,jessicajess,"I just started using the app, but it gives me a mini break to focus everyday which I love. After finishing the test I‚Äôm refreshed and ready to take on the rest of the day."
5,bookworm344,"I know it‚Äôs said with many apps but this one has helped me with day to day activities and hiccups, as well as give me tests I never knew I needed to take. 10/10 recommend"
5,Eve.taylor72,"This app is great for sharpening your mental skills. There are activities that target different areas of focus. Just getting started with this‚Ä¶also, not paying extra and still getting great content."
5,Foxxxy Momma,I really like this app. I‚Äôve tried others before and this one is by far better. I like seeing where I excelled and where I need to work more. Thanks bunches.  That‚Äôs about it! Dang how much do you expect me to write
5,Levyman,"I rarely add apps to my Home Screen and this one made it. Starting every day with this one as part of my morning routine. Smart app, gradually challenging over time‚Ä¶ highly recommend."
5,Terebella22,"This training involves unique games that are fun, get you thinking on your toes and strengthens those synapses in the brain.  I purchased it for the improved mental faculties but I find myself having fun and really enjoying it.  Great product."
5,BRax46,"If your trying to be on point of see better progress mentally, physically and spiritually you can do all of that once you do little habits like theses strategies and patterns help me out tons because I got ADHD. - Braxton Black"
5,Donald Thang,I want to improve myself. This app is what I hope the Lord Jesus will use to make me better . Thank you to all of you who work together as a team to create this awesome game. We need this in the world. God is awesome for making you guys so intelligent !!!
5,loyalty Guzman,Great for those who are not able to physically move around due to recovery but they can be able to exercise their mind and this is the perfect app for it to keep you sharp and functional
5,Trill Boiz,Impulse is very helpful if you feel like your brain is feeling lazy. Different varieties of levels to keep your brain sharp will definitely help with that issue. Definitely try this out!
5,djdjfjskekgiwjduwux,"This game is great for everything it is listed for;however, it‚Äôs memorization mini games are by-far the best. I have seen improvement and think you should get the game too!"
5,KArtthurTerry,I appreciate the subtle notifications saying come on and play for a bit. They also gives tips telling you other ways to improve brain health and that‚Äôs astounding
5,tlawbueghgal,"I have always been skeptical of these ‚Äúbrain training Apps‚Äù, however Impulse lived up to its name Day One! I woke up with the IMPULSE to improve my brain fitness! It‚Äôs fun and challenging, just the way I like physical fitness training!"
3,borchgacesucker,"I love this app! It‚Äôs really entertaining but, in between every challenge is an ad. Every time. It‚Äôs really annoying and it‚Äôs not like a ‚Äúyou skip once and it‚Äôs over ad,‚Äù no. The same ad pops up three times and you have to close out of each one before you can continue. Waste of time."
2,JollyJoseph,"Like so many apps available now, the pricing is just not worth it. I play other similar games that I have purchased without subscription and for a tenth of the lifetime price that appear to be similar or better. The pricing is just ridiculous. So nope. Also, why do app developers not update the pricing in the App Store? It is showing different pricing for the same options. Seems to be a deliberate tactic. Why?"
4,Corliss Cogan,"I thoroughly enjoy Impulse aside from the lack of visual contrasts between some of the games‚Äô color contrast. Also I train on my iPhone & the visuals are at times very crowded & small‚Ä¶ Some games I find too repetitive, however the sense of accomplishment is a welcome reward‚Ä¶"
1,HonestHamster,You have to pay for basically everything like if you take a test you have to pay for the results! It‚Äôs so annoying and doesn‚Äôt help it just makes me mad and I have ADD and OCD. If you have either of those mental disorders DO NOT GET THIS APP! This is a scam for money and don‚Äôt help! Just play other games even ones with adds are better than this trash. I can now not focus and it is hard for me to write this.
5,MayormMccheese,Only been a couple days but I‚Äôm enjoying the games so far! I got the lifetime pass just so I could have the games anyway for plane rides and stuff
5,sapoti21,"I enjoy the large variety of games, and there are all a lot of fun. I find when I‚Äôm consistent with using this app it truly does make a difference in memory, patterns, and so on and so forth."
5,Fmlinardo,Two days in & I love the games! They are interesting & different than some other I have played in the past. I shave also learned that I have ADHD and am now getting medicine for it. 5 stars
5,HeyHay1986,This app has allowed me to calm down and focus on just my brain. Plus tells me how smart I am!! I also love finding out more about myself. I really wish it was free. I‚Äôd be playing it all the time!!!
4,hey guys i,"It‚Äôs got a good free to play system where you can enjoy the games each day and still have some free to play content afterwards, even the tests I‚Äôve taken I‚Äôm able to see the results but not the full report on the free version."
5,396279292638,Games are quick and informative. The simple games give insight to deeper brain functions and the results tell you how your scores compare with others
5,RP_UND,This app allows me to train my brain in a fun way with new challenges daily that make you think them through and feel accomplished once completed.
5,Datzryt!,I‚Äôve really enjoyed impulse with the fact that it really makes you focus stop and enjoy a few minutes of some brain challenge.
5,teresahilton,"I work with patients in my field who suffer dementia and was curious how the App could help, knowing brain fatigue and memory loss comes with age!  I find it fun and also informative, I learn as I play and it‚Äôs good for my brain!"
3,Emily80811111,This app is pretty good and the games are somewhat helpfull. There are 2 things that I want fixed. 1 Thing is the free trial. You should not have to pay for something like you do in this app. 2 Thing is the games. They seem like they dont really help you in what the app says they will do. Overall this app is pretty good.
5,fredfred2020,Amazing app! I had downloaded other similar apps and I ended up keeping only this one because it has everything all the other apps had in just one app. Fun app.
5,DesaraeNycole,"I LOVE this app, it‚Äôs so great and keeps the brain going and helps memory and brain function it‚Äôs been a big help for me in my daily activities and mental health I definitely recommend! Worth the buy!!"
5,Alex james mooney,"Its an amazing app, gives me something to work on while im at school bored that still keeps my brain stimulated instead of dumbing it down on brainless apps! 10/10 would recommend!"
2,Sb208646,The app can be fun and insightful but they give you virtually no information without paying a premium. Want to take literally any test? You waste your time taking the test only to find that you must buy a year subscription to access the results. It‚Äôs absurd and they aren‚Äôt up front about it at all.
2,Annok1994,"Update: Too many ads have killed the user experience. From 5 stars to 2 stars. ‚Äî- Compared to all the other brain games I have played, this has been one of the best. Right amount of difficulty with the right amount of quickness. Time will tell to see how good this will be for my 28 year old brain. Starting early."
5,Tetris Seven,"I truly enjoy the mental challenge and fun of playing the games and mental tests here!  Please, add more Tower of Hanoi levels!! That‚Äôs my favorite brain teaser and I‚Äôve been just re-playing the 30 levels over and over! Thanks!"
5,Thatguy93943257,"I wasn‚Äôt sure that I would like this app but after playing on it once, I‚Äôm hooked. The games are always changing. It‚Äôs a fun way to keep your brain working."
5,PrettyGemini77,"Absolutely love the game, yea it has ads but only a few seconds long and you can skip past. I will play this at least once a day to keep my mind busy."
5,XxS@mxX,I haven't had the game for a while but so far i‚Äôve had a great experience. It has lots of features even when you don't pay! I highly recommend it.
1,HelloReviewReader,"I signed up for a free trial, which on its own is kind of a scam and hoping people forget they agreed to the autobill. But the free trial doesn‚Äôt even let you see the results of the test you took so what‚Äôs the point? I spent 10 minutes answering 72 questions about myself only to what‚Ä¶be forced to pay to get the results? Then how is it a free trial? And why didn‚Äôt they ask for the cost before I invested my time? The worst."
5,princesssop,"Fun puzzles and quiz games that remind you to stimulate your brain during the day. Might not seem like that big of a deal, but it actually does help to reinvigorate your concentration."
5,JenniMcCoy,Helps me to slow down and pay attention to the screen. Improved my memory and attention
5,Cheltzy Phillips,It‚Äôs hard to find time to complete enough healthy brain exercises. This only take a couple minutes and is fun! Totally worth it!
5,lilies1284,"Love the different brain training exercises. Simple math, memory games, selective attention games. Makes you think and pause for a few minutes. Try it! You‚Äôll be hooked."
5,Okie Steve,"The challenges provided are mind and reaction stimulating and after all, FUN. Try this to help you improve what‚Äôs essential to survive in this world besides all the FUN technology out there robbing us of our time."
2,Moviesmusic,The games are simple and you‚Äôll run through them quickly unless you‚Äôre cognitively challenged. Features such as Streak do not work (I play every day and it obnoxiously resets ‚Äústreak tracking‚Äù every few days). I can‚Äôt quite see how this app helps brain function but it def helps pass the time while sitting on the porcelain throne.
5,Shayami808,"If you have ADHD, just do it. This was an Impulsive (ha, get it?) buy late at night when I couldn‚Äôt shut my brain off and have found that it helps ground me in a fun and interactive way. So far, I love it."
5,trevinderr,It definitely helps me calm down if I‚Äôm stressing about something. It offers my brain a challenge when my day job doesn‚Äôt necessarily test my intellectual capabilities. 100% recommend!
4,Scope lab,"I just purchased this App this week.  I‚Äôm over 60 and needed to find a tool to help with mindfulness, focus and mental health.  So far, I‚Äôve really enjoyed the app and the different challenges and options it offers.  I‚Äôd definitely recommend it."
5,Monkeysmom11211022,"I love the games and daily training activities. Once I start, I find myself wanting to play more. Playing these for an hour or more helps my focus issues in my daily life."
5,doogerwooter,"Impulse is a Great way to relieve stress and learn more about yourself, but it makes you pay to get certain things like, removing ads, playing certain games, ect. Other than that it‚Äôs amazing!"
5,The King 6099,"This is a great way to start your morning! If you are like me and need a little more than coffee before work , we‚Äôll then double down with this app !! Make it your daily impulse!"
5,MJM22!,I had to reinstall after deleting for a while. I was missing something and I found it once again. Thanks!
1,Riss1987,I tried the free trial and was constantly bombarded into subscribing and paying. At least let us try the app without the truly constant stream of requests for payment in order to get a feel for it. That made me absolutely never want to purchase the app! The game shown in the ad that made me want to do the trial wasn‚Äôt even available in the demo. I don‚Äôt understand how this has 4.7 stars.
5,maman2fois,"I enjoy playing each game as it‚Äôs challenging, stimulating and fun to play! I know it‚Äôs improving my focus, memory and attention span.  It also helps me to think quicker and make better decisions in my job."
3,Krysd88,"I love the app itself, but there are ads in between each game that generally last 15-20 seconds. There are so many positives to the app as a whole, but being inundated with ads (let alone the same exact ones over and over) is a major downfall."
5,Cadmael,"Fun app for some brain work. Wish it would have gave a bit more with the free portion but not disappointed with the paid for. Don‚Äôt pay yearly, there is a lifetime version that‚Äôs $10 more then the yearly."
5,Noway777,"I originally found this game a few years ago and I loved it. So now, I have a little more time in my life so that I can enjoy it again. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to train your brain."
5,NabilS.,"I really like it because it feels like it actually challenges you and it‚Äôs super accurate, the interface is super smooth and the visuals are on POINT. Very impressed!"
5,Light Worker Swan,"So I freaking love this app. So far this app has helped me with my memory skills, my mathematical skills, it‚Äôs helped me to analyze the list literally is unending I highly suggest this app to anyone who wants to increase their IQ.  You‚Äôll thank me later      Yours Truly ~K.J. Pierce üíã"
5,Ghyhgthcuhcghg,"I showed my daughter Impulse and she started to play it and she learned so much from the game,she got better at math and brought her grade up,her memory got better,and her iq seems higher then usual I recommend this game so much love it!"
5,A-GamePeacock,Helps to know the games I play using impulse are beneficial towards building brain power instead of spending time scrolling through apps that are only making me dumber üòÇ
5,hkmb72,"It is only my second day of having Impulse, but I love it so far. I feel like this game gives me a chance to challenge my brain in different ways that I might not use normally. üëçüëç"
5,snshdghshd,I love how you set a challenge for yourself. It asks you questions at the start when you‚Äôre beginning and if you answer then it gives you the perfect question for you.
5,N8 miller,These games are really fun and the app is quick so you aren‚Äôt waiting for things to load or slow graphics to play.
5,justice and Layla,So I just wanted to write this review to share about this game because it has helped me with a lot I am very much smarter than I was before I played this game and it really helped me so thank you who ever invented this game
5,JUST STOP DAMMIT,I really like how it lets you play games whenever. Most apps like this only allow one game a day but even on the free version you still have the option for the free games.
5,MoodySobh,"I made the mistake of getting 1 year for $40 instead of $50 for lifetime, unfortunately they can‚Äôt reverse this mistake unless I talk to apple :( also I like how often this app notifies you to play!"
5,regnext,Impulse is a very enjoyable way to stimulate your mind at night or when waking up in the morning. The games you play test your mind In a very interesting and exciting way! Personally I give it a 10/10
1,auraviolet,I clicked on take test on an Instagram ad for this app. I did not take me to a test and asked me about myself and then immediately asked me to subscribe. I click the X in the corner I did not want to subscribe. But then it took me straight to the next screen as if I was a subscriber without my permission and appeared I was subscribed on a three day trial and then would be charged there after really really really upsetting to me not cool at all false advertising
5,Gwynny Poo,This game is great because instead of waking up and not knowing the first thing to do with yourself you can go straight to brain training and help your body and mind naturally know what to do next.
5,Deelee B,Great abs I feel like you‚Äôre actually doing something productive with your cell phone time while waiting in line or something to keep your brain active during lunch breaks.
5,J_Kav,"I now have cognitive, executive functioning, and memory issues due to Covid. This game is fun to use and hopefully will help. Frustrating because I used to be so much better at these things."
5,fugygdhtv,This app has help me so much I love it and give give it the same review I do I really love this game it‚Äôs Help over with anxiety it‚Äôs made my brain is super sharp and my bank my brain is like so intact and I have a problem with anxieties it really helps
5,"Laurie , SC","Best brain games app!‚Ä¶so much variety, it‚Äôs just what the doctor ordered for me to fight off generational dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs !..and it‚Äôs so much fun that I have a hard time turning it off!‚Ä¶I highly recommend this app for those looking for fun mental exercise!!"
5,nikkidank90tree,It is definitely challenging and I love a challenge. It‚Äôs also helping me learn to focus and not get frustrated so easily. Also feels good to be using my brain and getting a routine to give my brain a challenge everyday.
5,June Johnson,"I came for the IQ Test, but I stayed for the activities. It‚Äôs got great daily brain activities that help improve focus and brain dexterity. It‚Äôs a nice break for social media that helps me improve the quality of my thinking skills."
5,Fill warrel NOT REALLY,I use it now to help if I have a headache or if I just need to relax it‚Äôs a great way to take you mind off what‚Äôs going on and instead of doing nothing you are putting that brain to work. I love it thanks!!
5,TinCup@7,I stumbled upon this app while I was scrolling through my Instagram. Wondering what it would be like I downloaded the app and started playing it. It is truly amazing. Great job. I would recommend this to every friend.
5,shaunship,This is an amazing game you can play a lot of different things without paying a dime of course there are a decent amount of adds and there is a premium plan to play more but overall it‚Äôs a great game
5,Jlyah121800,This app is actually fun and I look forward to the three games I play every morning. Highly recommend if you like a little challenge or just want to exercise your brain. Great for all ages :)
5,Yourladyoffabulous,I‚Äôve enjoyed the thrill of having my brain get to exercise. It has different exercises so you don‚Äôt get stuck in one game. It changes every time depending on your progress.
5,Buddhamamma 6,Great fun and good way to exercise one‚Äôs brain. Can choose games or go with what comes up. Very enjoyable and one gains a great sense of completion of something from beginning to end. Even a few minutes a day helps!
4,KYMBERLEE21,"So far I am enjoying this app minus the ads, it warms my brain up in the mornings and challenge my cognitive skills and also my motor skills. I am currently in college, so this helps me to be able to dissect information as briskly as possible when taking tests!!!"
5,TwinDad57,I love the interactive games! I feel like it is a great way to start your day. I love the IQ test feature. I am thoroughly impressed with how user-friendly the app is so far. 10/10 would recommend.
4,Avery_theActress,"There are so many games that could be unlocked if you bought it, and it‚Äôs really annoying‚Ä¶ so if there were more games that you didn‚Äôt have to pay for, I would give it five stars, no doubt."
5,Lucy from the bed,That game got me fckd !! up because I have no clue how to hll I could not pic out a ‚Äúpair‚Äù when it was right in front of me there‚Äôs something ?! clearly there is something wrong with me and this app is on to it ! They got my attention
5,JRDLT,I‚Äôve been using this for two days so far and I gotta say that the exercises are challenging in a way that facilitates growth. Definitely recommend to everyone!
5,Danie ChatterBox,I enjoy mental stimulation. It makes me think & feel like I‚Äôm alive and trying to keep my brain active. Once your brain starts slipping you will wish you used tools like this app. It‚Äôs awesome!
5,BASTIANNA,"It‚Äôs a great way to keep the grey matter working, and you can play for as long or short a time as you wish with many different game and puzzles.  Enjoy!"
4,Scarrrr‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,I love this game it helps me focus and learn more about myself like if i had adhd or not its cool i learned my IQ and it has games so you wont have so many games downloaded just open this game and its the one you want like connect the dots sort the balls etc
5,The Only Mr. Trick,"While I have trouble keeping up with being daily- that‚Äôs my own problem. This game is comforting, creative and genuinely there when I need it. Totally recommend!"
5,crxstxna,Not sure if my mental acuity has improved any but the app is well built and the interface aesthetic is pleasingly consistent. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll run out of candy sort levels soon
5,Teeordieia,When you are retired from working. Your brain cells can start to slow down. This is a great way to keep them busy and productive.
5,RileyRollin,Definitely love that when I have down time I don‚Äôt resort to scrolling on Facebook instead I get on this app and relax unwind and refocus my brain definitely a great coping skill if dealing with stress
5,cgeremai,I paid for the lifetime subscription and I‚Äôm glad I did. I didn‚Äôt realize the upkeep I needed for my brain. Puzzles that I was so good at as a kid have drifted. Glad to be back on top of things. Hoping to not get Alzheimer‚Äôs (fingers crossed)!
5,Codover,So far I‚Äôve only used it for a few days and so far I really enjoy how it‚Äôs making me feel. My brain almost feels like it‚Äôs getting a work out and I‚Äôm feeling more confident.
5,N. Brockton,I get notifications each morning and I enjoy the few minutes I spend completing the daily brain exercises. Thank you!!
1,Ferparedes,"I purchased the app and really enjoyed it to the point I downloaded it to my daughter‚Äôs iPad. I am not enjoying it anymore as the intensity of the ads basically push you to pay extra for the ad free service and that to me is bad planning, I understand you need to make money but introducing ads in such an aggressive way later on is not going to help you."
5,Chitamra,I had a stroke and ruptured aneurysm two month ago.   I was very lucky to survive and that things were pretty good.   I just have gaps as I am speaking and forget.   I am using this to keep my brain active.
5,CourtieHope,"This app is fun, exciting, interesting, knowledgeable and informative! You can excel in growth here- challenge your brain and learn more about your skills & discover more about yourself! Enjoy!! :-)"
5,Just Dre,"The games are very fun, and I like how you get rewarded with different prizes when you win and I like the trophies, and it is something that I can see me doing every day for the rest of my life"
5,boy with 5 heads,What a fun game. I like to use it when I have a couple of minutes of down time or when I transition from physical activity to sitting at a computer. Helps me change my focus and it‚Äôs fun.
5,Mateos707,"I love this app it has a lot of good exercises for the brain and awareness as well as simple challenges that only make us better at focusing,math,awareness,and our timing I would recommend this app to anyone."
4,@ari.jj,"Impulse is a great brain training game, though games can be tough and frustrating, it still is fun.  If you‚Äôre competitive, like me, it‚Äôs very frustrating especially when it give you a percentage and it‚Äôs low. Other than that the game is great."
5,Hobswife,I‚Äôve just downloaded Impulse in the last couple of days. So far I am finding it really fun. The games are engaging and are look forward to playing these games everyday.
5,MuL_Litt,"I suffer from years of addiction and epilepsy, which has deteriorated my memory tremendously. So far the activities are easy but I‚Äôm hopeful with repetition and being challenged, I can improve my brain functioning!!"
5,mltillman96,"As someone with a severe brain injury I appreciate having things like this available. I‚Äôve just begun to use the app, but so far so good!  If my brain could only remind me to use it!"
5,GODZBESTCREATION,I find myself not being as sharp as I was in my younger years so this app helps to sharpen my brain. It may seem simple but what I get from this app allows me to put the small things into focus.
1,Triple stringer,"The games are mediocre, I downloaded the app and started the trial membership. After using the app a few times, I got bored as the games were repetitive and not very stimulating. I was charged for 3 weeks because I didn‚Äôt cancel. My request for refund was denied even though I didn‚Äôt use the app during the 3 weeks. They charge 6.99$ per week! Outrageous for such a basic game."
4,cheftot,"I enjoy the content on Impulse. However the price to use the app feels quite steep. 30 dollars for the year or a one time payment of 50 dollars. Seems equivalent to a console game, with less content to drive the time with play per pay."
5,Iamawesomeobviously,Not gonna lie it‚Äôs kinda desperate for you to buy the no adds pass it keeps telling you to buy No adds! It‚Äôs just sounds desperate but the game is really good and the games are fun I recommend this brain testing game!
5,IshDodo,Using this app for a week I felt the improvement in every way my brain was just overall sharper smarter and faster
5,Dboneil,This has had so much helping for my memory issues and focusing failures and so much fun to spend super sweet times every day. The very best way to have so much fun.
5,Dulciannaj,I actually enjoy doing my daily little brain teasers. I like that it makes you do a little bit of everything and they are not always super super easy.
5,HeatherFüòÄ,This is definitely worth the purchase!
5,Ashers MoBashers,"When work has been tough for me, I‚Äôve used this to stimulate my brain and feed myself little mental rewards, on a daily basis. It‚Äôs worth the buy for a year!"
5,JonMVera,This app is pretty cool gives your plenty of insights to strengths and weaknesses also let‚Äôs you get more in tune with yourself. I like it so far and I look forward to improving areas of my brain.
5,Zen Jeff,"Impulse is easy to use, and the games give you the results you seek. I have used other apps similar to this, but none have yielded as significant results as Impulse!!"
4,Thanks!?!,"This game really entertains my brain and gives me challenging questions to get my brain going. This game is also very helpful in the summer because I forget sometimes so it helps a lot. This Is why your game helps the brain, Thank you!"
2,Angelgoncr8za,I only paid for this appt for this game as it‚Äôs my favorite but I already passed the levels so I keep having to replay the same levels I already passed.. now I‚Äôm regretting paying for this game.. I asked for a refund since I‚Äôm just replaying the same games cuz there is no more levels even though it says it‚Äôs working on it. I like that game to help with my anxiety
5,CheleeBean,I love doing the challenges right when I wake up to see how alert my brain is first thing in the morning. It‚Äôs a great way to wake up the mind and get it ready for the day!
4,JPC2021,"I like the games, sometimes the interface doesn‚Äôt work so well. Overall makes solve problems and keeps your brain active."
5,dofrye,Are the game and way or hard.  The games are super easy to learn so you can stay playing immediately.  But the game itself is hard and is challenging.  I love that part.
5,Gempath,I have been playing a Hidden Objects game for several years now to keep my brain young.  This App will challenge me even further.  Looking forward to my daily sessions
5,Delvec1,"I don‚Äôt know the science behind it, but I know that I enjoy taking the time out of a busy schedule to let my brain do things it normally doesn‚Äôt have the opportunity to do."
5,Nothingbut100,"It doesn‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm working on memory or concentration. I feel like I‚Äôm playing games üòÇ but you do have to think, it‚Äôs not mindless which is refreshing!"
5,blueeyedblondie6432,So far this is my second day playing this cognitive game. I like it because if I play long enough my memory will improve as well as my motor skills and my decision making skills. So far so good!
5,Juan Esteban Cano,Awesome collection of brain games. I‚Äôm the morning it helps me turn on the brain and if I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping at night it also helps to calm me down until I pass out.
5,iiiiiiiiiigggggkkwo,"Impulse has helped me sharpen my brain and attention skills, since I struggle with attention. I have learned a lot just from doing my lessons daily. I also have been getting better test scores."
5,Loric0426,I am always working on ways to improve my memory and overall brain function Impulse is the perfect app to help me achieve goals.
5,S10ChckRR,"I absolutely love this app! It improves my overall memory recall capabilities and quick thinking skills. If you are a life-long learner like me, you will definitely appreciate what this app has to offer!"
3,coliunwwwwww,"I got this app bc I wanted to test my iq and even though it gave me the number, you had to pay for the full evaluation which is so annoying. I like doing the brain strengthening games daily, but there are also a lot of adds and it‚Äôs always trying to get me to pay for a subscription."
5,TarHyungIsBae95z,I enjoy this app way more then I anticipated. The games and tasks are simple and fun. They remind me of the computer games I used to play at school during typing class. All in all an awesome app!
5,leeannp34,I find it best to play when everything is going on around me like today riding with my honey down the backroads music playing loud and trying to concentrate on the game is a whole different ball park
5,rollingeyes113,This app is so cool I can‚Äôt get enough! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è but if you don‚Äôt have the money for the subscription the ads are so ridiculous and long it makes me delete it. Super annoying
5,Xwizardharry,"I love this game so much. It makes my brain work harder than ever and I would recommend this to any ages. It‚Äôs fun in general, but you also get some brain power in it as well. Download asap!!!!"
1,FrannaFS,"I set the notifications to remind me once a day at 5PM but I get bombarded with reminders and junk notifications every couple hours or so. It is distracting and annoying beyond belief. It seemed like a nice feature to be reminded once a day, but this is forcing me to turn the notifications off completely due to an overload of notifications. I guess this app will sit and burn in the background. Disappointing"
5,NeptunesCompass,I like impulse because it keeps me from being bored. It has quizes you can take and lots of simple fun games to play. I definitely recomend it to people who find themselves bored often.
5,Halloweenie888,The puzzles are good. There is a great variety. The extra games are nice bc they are just like other puzzle games I have on it phone without the ads. Glad I paid for a year subscription
4,brandiallen310,I really enjoy the little challenges and tests they give you. You don‚Äôt think that it will be difficult but once you start a challenge and are on a time limit it makes it all the more challenging and fun.
5,baseball player 37,"So I know how you have to pay, but you don‚Äôt have to. This game is fun without the subscription. You can still set up a daily goal, but I‚Äôve passed the goal and got hooked on playing this!"
5,chamodadon,"Great so far, but then again these are just the intermediate levels. can‚Äôt wait to leave another review after my year subscription to see results"
5,Smileyhead03,This apps allows you to really utilize your brain. I like the different games they have and different ways to use your brain to gain skills and to see what skills you already obtain.
5,NightPhotographer,This is my second go around on this game. I did really well the first time on most games. It challenges my memory and cognitive awareness. Wish there were more like this.
4,Unicorn4jaci,I got this app to keep my mind sharp. Also it‚Äôs a better way to pass time than some numbing game. This way you can keep your brain sharp.  It‚Äôs fun so far. I like that they have many different types of games to choose from.
5,Shekey.Official,It gives me a chance to use my critical thinking. Also strengthening and conditioning the motor skills doesn‚Äôt hurt. I forget how much learning new things helps to change the way I think.
5,Arynkh,Th games gives you ratings on how you do compared to others who are your age and play the games. I know it‚Äôs not always good to compare and it might not be accurate but it is a great confidence builder.
5,Disposable heroine,"Instead of downloading a dozen word apps and tube games, just download this. It contains many games and doesn't have intrusive ads in the middle of your experience."
5,TheDoubleOh,Fun games to keep mental activity going. You can set the amount of time you‚Äôd like to spend each day. There are also other features such as test to learn more about yourself.
4,celand555,"I have only used the game for two days so far, but I find it very interesting. I don‚Äôt think I have played it enough to see any improvements ,but I would like to continue to work on the games to see what happens."
5,thisappisbadnews,I have Post Concussion Syndrome & have to train my brain because I have daily headaches following the concussion.   This app has a wide variety of options. Keep interest & is fun.
5,SashaC.,This is my first time using a brain workout app and I like this one so far. The games keep me interested and keep me focused. I like how I can set how many minutes I want to devote to brain games per day.
5,RosieDarazio,It‚Äôs fun and get my brain up and moving. The ads are really short so you don‚Äôt have to pay for extra stuff if you don‚Äôt want to and can still enjoy the app.
5,Gigglez610,"I‚Äôm a very distracted person , it‚Äôs hard for me to see details on the basic day . This has help me to become aware of my surroundings and also learn new things about my mind and eyesight ."
4,kimandoz,I sure wish they would make this free! The data and algorithms they receive from us playing is payment enough. I‚Äôm not going to pay for it because there are plenty of free games to keep my mind sharp
5,simging man,Wow! Didn‚Äôt realize how slow I am. It is eye-opening. Definitely a good to exercise my brain. I‚Äôm looking forward to her playing seeing some improvement over time.
4,aja !,"The reason why i didnt give it a 6 is bc nothing is perfect. Anyways, im 13 and i have problems remembering things and im trying to get better for my exams coming up!! Its very fun and i like it soo much that i recommended to my friends! Keep up the great work you guys <3 :)"
5,Very concerned customer Claire,There could be less ads and add more exercises for people who don‚Äôt have the plan. Please because my parents won‚Äôt let me get the plan so I can really only play the gamesüò•. Have a good day!
5,cukie333,I have adhd pretty bad& it wasn‚Äôt even hard for me to remember to do the exercises here on impulse app‚Ä¶(if u have adhd you‚Äôll know what I mean) it‚Äôs like candy for the eyes& brain while helping improve certain troubling areas! Thank you Impulse!!üíêüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Joynutt,"Yep, if your awake, this is a flip‚Äôn challenge!  Keep your brain working and ‚Äúplay‚Äù  without fear of feeling inept.  This has been fun and when I fail, I know I will do better next time.  No criticism from anybody but my own mind."
5,mrcoachking,"I stuge focusing on screens. With everything moving to screens, computers, tablets and phones, this app is helping me become more aware.  Also Bulding my attention span while using screen.  This helps me more productive!"
5,SassyazE,"It makes you concentrate strictly on you for those few mins it takes to do the quizzes, I instead of all the other things that come with daily life."
5,Owl Be Watching,"I love the challenges that are offered for free, it is improving my memory and keeping me alert. I want to keep my memory intact as long as I can and Impulse is helping me to do that! Thank you;)"
1,Coop_48,This app may cure a little boredom but this app is all about the money. There are so many ads and I mean like 4 within a minute of playing and that is not an exaggeration. You also can‚Äôt get the whole game without paying for it and I think that is very annoying. This game makes you learn more about how quickly you can skip an ad than anything else. Do not waste your time.
5,Ttammi,I enjoy that each game has its own type of puzzles and challenges. This game keeps you coming back each day to keep training your brain!
5,Leeeeaaah,I'm in love with this app. So far I've done multiple trainings and ive only gotten a total of 2 ads!!! I 100% recommend if your looking for a game to help improve the way you think! ‚ô°
5,BBaez22,I haven‚Äôt been using this app long (2 days to be exact) BUT I really like the games. They are fun and I love all the quizzes that allow you to get to know yourself a bit more. Good job awesome app.
5,designated listener,I was worried about being aware of cognitive decline so I started using Impulse as a daily way to test myself. I‚Äôm not much of a game person but these are brief and challenging enough for the most part.
5,MrsGirouard,I have dyscalculia and I am very anxious when doing math. I feel like this is helping me and it feels good to see my immediate progress! I would say everyone would enjoy these games.
5,grneyez1010,Great way to improve your memory‚Ä¶would probably do better if I wasn‚Äôt watching tv while playing. But shows multitasking is possible. Love the variety.
5,ultimate teapot,I really struggle waking up in the mornings. Give me coffee! I treat myself to a few Impulse games first thing before getting out of bed and it makes my next task a bit easier.
5,maiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,It‚Äôs a amazing game to play for kids and adults and the discounts they give when u first get the game but I think they should let us see the results when we do the tests
5,partyslippers,"It‚Äôs great! My doctor recommended it. How fun, my doctor says I can play games every day. I am seeing improvement already."
5,Vcns2,It‚Äôs better than being sucked into social media and is a nice little break from working. Helps to palette cleanse so I can go back to working feeling a bit refreshed.
5,Contagiz Culture Media,"Just as it‚Äôs important to train your muscles and exercise the body, it‚Äôs just as important if not more important to train your brain as all things begin with a THOUGHT or some form of thinking. Thanks Impulse app üôåüèæüôèüèæ"
1,C.Fred,"I tried the app after seeing a test in an ad. The test isn‚Äôt in the app.  So I took another test. Even with a free trial of unlimited (sic) pro access, it wouldn‚Äôt give me the result without paying for a subscription.  Based on this deceit, I will not use the app. I find myself wanting to report the app to my state‚Äôs attorney general for deceptive, bait-and-switch advertising."
5,wgcbear,"I‚Äôm 65+ and this program on my phone is a convenient way to reassure me that my brain is healthy.  Given my other health concerns and medications, I feel better about my head!"
2,basaltbetta,"im okay with paying a fee to have this app, but i have never seen an app that requires a membership AND has ads that pop up before and after every activity. the frenquency of these ads made me uninstall this app, i dont pay money to this app just for them to shove full screen ads in my face for more money."
5,tarko23,"I have only used it couple times‚Ä¶ its super fun, also to see ur results compared to other users is extremely exciting. We shall see how this experience continues."
5,Rickybfit,Just started using this app and I enjoy having it for when I have some free time or am on lunch break at work.
2,cricontrol,"The games and puzzles just repeat. It says over 200 puzzles but there are only about 3 different puzzles and they just repeat over and over. So bored doing the same challenges and puzzles. I‚Äôve played a lot of free games with more variety. The tests were fine but once you‚Äôve completed them, you have nothing new to do."
5,Dghcfhjvc,I‚Äôve only been using it for 2 days at this point but I can tell an improvement. I know it sounds crazy but I think this is worth it.
1,Huntercherry,"The creator, GMRD Apps Limited is an Israeli company that's been in the news for developing spyware and surveillance technology. They've been linked to some pretty shady stuff, including selling their technology to authoritarian regimes. They're the creators of the infamous Pegasus spyware, which has been used to target journalists, activists, and political opponents. Sounds like a lovely bunch. Theyre getting rich off of your data and helping put us all in a virtual prison. You're welcome."
5,Puzzlesdktt,"Easy to play games, but always challenging and always leave room for improvement so you never feel you hit a wall."
5,NobleNatasha,It‚Äôs great to play with when you‚Äôre bored and increases your mentality. Keep yourself busy on down time when you have to wait and you‚Äôll gain benefits and patience as part of self love.
5,Mtg0verlord,It‚Äôs the free version so far and I‚Äôve just had an opportunity to see the problems for myself to focus more with. But still more to improve! Just wish it was free tbh.
5,penguin4282,I do puzzles for 30 minutes and at school I get only A+ because my brain is so sharp because of impulse thank you so very much for making impulse
5,Btbites,"I‚Äôm 61, and I‚Äôm loving this app. It‚Äôs helping me with not only my memory, by playing the game but, it‚Äôs also helped me with insight into how my brain works and my emotions and how I can do things to better myself."
5,Maui229,I just started using the app but I‚Äôm loving every game it has picked out for me. I‚Äôm doing my daily challenges and they‚Äôre fun all the while it helps my brain. Best brain game app out right now!! Thank you Impulse!!!
5,Not A flyleaf fan,How is it that you play a game and then feel more focused?!? This game is it. I can do a quick warm up game and then I‚Äôm more focused throughout the day and a lot more productive since I‚Äôve been challenged!. I love this app!
5,Chiquigon,"Just started and love it. I have ADD and this I hope will help me focus, etc. great app!!!! Will work on it every day üëçüèª. I will get faster at games, didn‚Äôt realize how slow I have become"
5,Neb Cyclone,"Fun games, informative and detailed personal development quizzes. Also simple and engaging. This isn‚Äôt the bland sit and stare stuff that‚Äôs so common. Feels like you‚Äôre actually developing as you do the exercises."
5,Piecesofyou,I highly recommend not only am I learning a lot about myself I‚Äôm also training my mind 10/10 recommend !
3,Shelia macks,I enjoy the set up of the app and the tests themselves are so easy to work through and understand. You can‚Äôt get any of your reports back until you pay for them tho or get premium. It‚Äôs a great app but expect to spend money for abt everything.
5,Ghost Mane 304,This is one of the best games for all ages actually as long as they understand what they‚Äôre doing this game challenges you to make quick decisions and smart choices as well
5,J Stummy,I enjoy Impulse because it makes you think differently from our everyday activities. It‚Äôs self challenging and makes me want to do and be better.
5,mel_48,I like the game due to it being multiple different types of games that can help you increase your speed and the way you learn and such.
2,WaywardK99,"The cleverest thing about this app is how it convinces people it‚Äôs for their own benefit when the whole thing is built to take more and more of your money. Every little thing is an upsell. It‚Äôs a very well designed grift. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Everything in here is available free elsewhere. It‚Äôs all presented in a nice package, but it‚Äôs a shallow facade."
4,DragonBeard1061,Awesome way to train my brain. I‚Äôm noticing much more focused attention and my problem solving skills are becoming better as I‚Äôm able to resolve issues or situations without overthinking them. And the games are pretty fun too. One of the best 25 bucks I‚Äôve spent in a while!
5,Vnar1,"I really enjoy this app, the games although they seem simple is crazy to see how you can make mistakes and realise that you are not as sharp as you thought you are! Fun, entertaining and easy!"
5,E. Balesteri,"I‚Äôve tried lots of brain training games, but find many boring. These exercises are fun and easy to understand. Straightforward, with a variety of options to strengthen lots of aspects of mental acuity."
5,KBrabham,I wanted some fun games to play to keep my brain sharp and work on my processing speed. This app has a variety of very fun games that increase in challenge. I highly recommend it!
2,Anon7298200474,"App is really good and the games are fun- I don‚Äôt mind paying for it but the constant pay walls are really frustrating. You need to upgrade all the time and pay one time fees for things like test results. Pretty annoying.  Anyway, I deleted it after I saw an ad for a different app on this app after paying for the subscription. So I‚Äôm out."
4,BeddrvXxs,"This app is fun, and easy to understand for the most part. I was in one game that just kept going and going and I wasn‚Äôt sure when it would end so after 20 levels I just closed it.  I like seeing my progress."
5,this process is torture,I‚Äôm bipolar 2 and have PTSD from 21 years of Army service. Impulse gets my mind conditioned to be more present in my mindfulness practice helping me stay ahead of a trauma response that may adversely effect the people around me. It‚Äôs a great tool.
5,ihearthovercrafting,This helps my brain with quick memory which I feel has been hard after going through chemo.
5,ahonaker44,"I was skeptical of this app working to strengthen my noggin but, I‚Äôm honestly surprised at my enthusiasm for it. It makes me feel good about myself, that I seem to be getting a better memory and hand eye coordination. 5+"
2,Willow is away,"Instagram ads prominently show off an ‚ÄúADHD type‚Äù quiz, however once downloading the app it is nowhere to be found. What‚Äôs more is that the so called free trial does not give you access to the full app. It still prompts you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to a weekly/yearly subscription to gain access to much of the app‚Äôs content. Disappointing to say the least"
5,yoyoyotogo,Pretty good app! I like the different types of puzzles and it gives you results on your group how well you have done. It does get my brain going that‚Äôs for sure!
4,Tikvah42,If this app didn‚Äôt cost nearly all of my disability paycheck each month I‚Äôd be all over training on it often. The games are fun and help you stay sharp while appearing to just be enjoying some games.   Too bad I can‚Äôt afford it üò¢
5,mmangel2015,"Love the different options they provide. Not just a bubble popping game or a , matching game . Seems there are tons of different options for training the Brain and they have a great schedule."
5,Gageemc,I have a really poor memory. As I‚Äôm aging it‚Äôs becoming increasingly apparent. These ‚Äúgames‚Äù are really challenging me to work with what I have and hopefully improve! Love the fact that it‚Äôs games but also brain exercise.
5,rkfedwdedde,"This game is not only good for your brain, but it is fun to play aswell. This game has an equal amount of things to pick from if you get bored, and is great for sitting down and relaxing after work. 10/10 love this game!!!"
5,MadDeziner,I just started using Impulse. I‚Äôm performing better than I thought I would which has increased my confidence in my memory and recall. It‚Äôs a great app to improve and sharpen your memory and cognitive skills!
5,wuckyduck,Finally a puzzle game that keeps my interest with the variety and skill level. Im also impressed that the creator is interested in feedback to keep the game at the highest quality.
5,Nixydix,I have so enjoyed the variety of challenges and how my brain is being judged to engage in different ways. I wake up looking forward to how I can beat my records. Such a great tool that doesn‚Äôt get boring.
5,Meg5227,I started this to exercise and challenge my brain but the games are actually fun. I love the variety and my goal was to do 5 minutes a day but I find myself on for over 30!
5,MrAllN1,"I often look for games that stimulates my brain, and Impulse is top tier. Although some games may seem simplistic, I do love how there is detail before the game that explains what the game is helping you to achieve. Thank you for this"
4,caaasso,"I‚Äôve only had it for 2 days but the games are fun, only reason I s not 5 stars is because of the ads they are frequent and back to back but not terrible due to them only being 5-10 seconds long"
5,BlackTheCool88,Some down sides are you do have to pay some money to get the full game and there are some glitches but it is a great app to play.
5,King death knight,This is a nice break from some of the more complicated work throughout the day. And way better for not losing your whole day to than something mind numbing like tv.
5,fortnite master wohoo,This is a game that challenges your brain to move past it‚Äôs limits and stretch itself! It makes your brain think faster and work harder. Overall it‚Äôs just a really fun game!
5,HeyaBondaya,I just downloaded this yesterday so I can‚Äôt speak in experienced terms of this app but so far I love the idea and it‚Äôs helpfulness! It‚Äôs keeping me on my toes with the daily challenges and it even has tips on how to boost your mental and physical strength!
4,venusskyy,I feel if we watch all the ads we should be able to have stuff free instead of subscriptions. What if this helped someone who had absolutely no money and it kept them busy for a minute or two?
5,Astrid7940,I downloaded this to see how sharp my mind. The games are simple and quick. The app sends your reminders but not so many you get annoyed it has a great balance of fun and challenges.
5,D Fuchs66,This training game I‚Äôll be at an easy level is fun and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm forgetting things that make me feel stupid. I feel very uplifted when I‚Äôm done playing.
3,Gutgg,"This is just a thought and I have no proof. But this app listed me as being in the 5 percentile of other users my age meaning 95 percent of my peers are better than me at the activities.  Now I‚Äôll say that I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was true, sadly haha, but I also was thinking it might be a ploy to get users to subscribe to the app. Listing a low percentile makes them feel they need to improve so they then buy the app.   Basically a modern con artist.   This is just a thought though and I have no proof.  Otherwise the games are fun but it sounds like other people have had trouble with these developers  so"
5,Miss spangler,"I‚Äôm basically addicted to this but it‚Äôs also so relaxing my family is like where are you because how fun, relaxing, and entertaining it is. It also just relives my mind. And helps me with my anexity"
5,Allison KT,"I love this app! I have seen huge gains in my memory, mental math, and attention since starting daily lessons. Love feeling like I‚Äôm doing something productive on my phone!"
5,shdksjwish,Downloaded the app for my entire family; great way to get the kids from staring at YouTube‚Äôs videos like little zombies and get their brains activated.
5,Hairstylist1183,"It‚Äôs fun, it feels like you‚Äôre playing a game. I‚Äôm 40 years old and I felt like my mind was starting to go a little bit by playing this game I feel like I‚Äôm stimulating my brain while having fun!"
5,jxcush,Some things are hard to prevent‚Ä¶ like our memory lapse that we don‚Äôt see coming.   This is a nice option with a great variation of tools to keep me on track.   Jxc
5,omshesaid,I find I enjoy this app so much more than the other games I have downloaded cause I know it‚Äôs improving my brain skills!
4,CrissiKaye,I enjoy the challenge of the different games and brain activities in the Impulse app. It‚Äôs easy at times and difficult on other occasions but the challenge makes it fun to try and master the more difficult games.
5,Emari411,"Ever since I graduated I haven‚Äôt had much to do that stimulates my brain, but this app completely changed that. It‚Äôs really helpful to help sharpen your mind and keep you busy."
5,Studenton3,"The 2 areas of my ADHD that I struggle with are getting distracted easily and forgetting something I need to do. These games help my mind stay quick, focused and boosts my memory skills."
5,dpartridge3,"I downloaded this application because I was interested in adding fun games to my iPhone App Library. What i got instead was an in-depth analysis of my personality type, interests, and skills."
5,Bill659,"The puzzles and tests are timed, which I love.   Haven‚Äôt had to solve problems this fast since my Air Traffic Control days.   Feels good to feel the pressure again.  I guess that‚Äôs a good thing?"
5,"Another book, please!",I‚Äôve been looking for a way to keep my brain sharp as I notice that aging is taking a toll on my memory skills.  I just joined Impulse and I really like it.  Highly recommend it!
5,PlayerAV,The games are just the right amount of challenge so they are not stressful.  I also like that the games are quick!
5,Jbunnii,This is game is great training. I‚Äôve surprised myself so far on accuracies etc. Each day is different and it doesn‚Äôt get boring with the cycle. I recommend checking this out.
4,Josephsha,"They put in the research and time to tell you how each game can help you. With time, your skills will increase. The only downside is that there are free versions of almost all of these games elsewhere."
5,LizShem,I just turned 61 and I noticed my memory and brain slipping a little. I love these games and I look forward to playing them every day! They‚Äôre fun and I‚Äôm improving my brain health! A win-win.
5,Deb Zieno,I like the different games built within this app.  It helps keep my mind sharp and and works to build my memory with the different tasks.
5,Boodillie,I enjoy this app but hate the ads. I went ahead and gave 5 stars since it‚Äôs not their fault I can‚Äôt afford to pay the subscription. They need to make money.
4,Lau218,I love this game! Lately when I open it up some of my completed games aren‚Äôt registered as completed. Like I did it too fast and it didn‚Äôt register as done even though I‚Äôm on the next game.
5,Vaylyne,"Lots of levels of a wide variety of tests, puzzles, and games. Appropriate for many ages groups. Daily tasks to help reach goals. I‚Äôve found everything fun and attainable, good boost :)"
4,Mr.Greeneyes.,Went through all the steps and got to a pay wall so even though there was a 3 day trial $7 a week after that is a big ask. So unfortunately I was unable to enjoy or try your app.
5,-)Catnip(-,"I just started this app and I like it. I have difficulties with memory and concentration. This app teaches to focus. So far, it‚Äôs entertaining, as it gets harder I will struggle. I‚Äôd rather struggle than lose more of me."
1,Aubrey Dodd,"This app was fine for a few weeks - way too many ads but that was to be expected. Now every time I try to use the app I am bombarded by the same spam pop up over and over again. This pop up is not one of the in game ads, but a literal pop up that suddenly opens in my browser mid game saying to ‚Äúclaim my prize.‚Äù Absolutely obnoxious and not worth it."
5,Gffhbghc,Impulse is the best game because you get to challenge your brain. You can also learn if you need to do better at listening in class or to your parents!
5,TyB i3,"I used Luminosity years ago and found it useful.  This is a fresh new approach to brain games and while I am only two days in, it seems like a great series of brain games.  Thanks!"
5,Lil Ede,I like the way I can warm up first & I also like the percentage of how much higher or lower you are compared to our peers which is given at the end of each test.
5,issadeal,Impulse is a great game. It sharpens your mind and skills. I like that I can play mini games to pass the time when I‚Äôm bored or have a break at work or even a few minutes before bed.
5,Jowanabe,Fun way to train your brain on the daily‚Ä¶ just feels like games I would play to pass the time!!! If I‚Äôm gonna play games in my phone I definitely want them to help my mental acuity like this app!!!!
5,Goldegirl88,"I've been playing Impulse for a few days now, and I'm really enjoying it! I'm excited to get on and do my daily tasks, and then challenge myself to do even more!"
3,Nm 99,What happened to the challenges? Was trying to hit 365 :-/. Would love if you only did 3 games for a challenge day and had ability to pick between 2 similar workouts.  Would also love more levels on games! Especially candy sort.
5,CynKinGa,"I have not been using this training for long, but I already feel sharper and quicker in my brain processing time. Also, the games a are a lot of fun!"
4,GiaChico,"I‚Äôm glad I found this game, it‚Äôs enjoyable and I feel like I‚Äôm really working my brain. The only reason for the 4 stars is because I got a 92% off discount, however, what I paid was not 92% off.. it was a little less then 50% off."
5,Glenda Gayle,"I enjoy training my brain in this app due to its clear under of how to play the games, and the challenges are fun. To know it is this easy to exercise my brain is well worth the money spent!"
5,Orion Blake,I like this game Because it has many tests you can do to see certain things a out yourself. It also trains your brain and I find it effective. I can feel my brain cells flexing
5,coolerunkown,Just like in the ads there are different puzzles to solve and try.I would definitely recommend for anybody who likes to do puzzles.
5,üíò‚ú®üåüüé∂,"They should add the attatchment styles test, but yea this app is great. You can take the tests as many times as you want, the games are fun!! They grow more challenging so really are learning and expanding! Totally would recommend"
5,Lamethlik,So very excitingly entertaining and gratifying as I improve and experience greater IQ levels each time I master each level.
5,TheMadHaller,If you‚Äôre looking to just get your brained turned on before work or you take on the day. This app is great for that! Simple fun and quick to get through.
5,Ella123456788960,"I downloaded Impulse as a joke after I saw an add on tic tok, but when actually saw the app it honestly surprised me. The tasks and games it provides are simple, fun and encourages strengthening the brain in a non stressful way. Truly a great app."
5,monjott,"I just started using this app ,mand so far it has been fun but easy. I am sure once I get more time in it under my belt, it will become more challenging. And who does‚Äôt like a good challenge?"
3,MicahDeez,"The quality of the questions and the functionality of the app are professionally streamlined and tastefully assembled, there is no doubly about that. But to offer a ‚Äú3 day free trial‚Äù but still have all of the test results and personality archetype reports etc. hidden behind a pay just feels kinda ‚Äúcash-grabby.‚Äù"
5,kkemond,"It really does get more difficult.  No expectations, and enough variety to keep you playing even if you ‚Äúlose‚Äù one game."
5,Yng Mimi,This app has helped me so much. As I‚Äôve been getting old I‚Äôve been struggling with my memory and looking for ways to keep my brain active. Such a fun way to meet my goals.
5,Kingkody777,Love it!! Don‚Äôt love having to pay but I got the 92% off so a year was 30 bucks not bad. Love the games makes me feel better about myself at the end of the day knowing I outperformed 99% of my age

5,ChiMom75,"My friends tell me that if it‚Äôs not complicated, it‚Äôs boring for me.  I find peace in challenges and chaos because I gravitate towards the eye of the storm.  I love how it relaxes my brain by challenging it.  I can go to my happy place here!!!"
5,smooithe,It makes me fell like my brain is getting really smarter and helping me out with the process of it it has made my life and brain easier and more accurate.  It also helps me with some things like school work and solving math problems and issues with it.  It takes me a lot of effort and time and most importantly a lot of explaining to tell how good this and how amazingly good this app really is if I‚Äôm being honest.

5,Streets hopper,This app is way more intriguing than I thought it would be.  It keeps me engaged and makes me want to come back for more. It youvhes on everything too

5,Chandra Lockley,I have been on disability for 9 years now and without the daily grind of working my skills have deteriorated rapidly. This is one of the best apps to work out with I have found.
5,got uuuui,"It is the most mind-relieving game and stress relief that can occupy the time when you are all and will have a funny feeling, bad feeling, on an expected day feeling and it will take away all of that."
5,Cella_K,In my older age I‚Äôve realized that keeping my brain active is incredibly important. I e actually been looking for brain exercises on a mobile device and found this app. It‚Äôs truly awesome.
5,8131191213,I like impulse because my brain has been getting better there are some things that a  ok me people might not like but I like the app it‚Äôs also fun so I recommend it
5,Justy0,"I really enjoy this game so far. The ads are skip-able after only a few seconds for the free version which is nice, and all the games are fun but challenging!"
5,Djavo,So far seems like a fun way to keep mentally sharp. Games are not odd nor does the app incessantly ask marketing type questions in between games.
5,LyddBabby,Really engaging and exciting challenges that are hard enough to actually challenge you but fun enough to make you want to do better and keep playing!
4,sweet lauralee,"I like most of the tests and games and I am trying to keep my brain healthy.  A few of them make me kind of anxious, but perhaps as I get better over time, that won‚Äôt happen.  I think this will be a good way to keep my brain sharp."
4,maya jensen :),"although it might seem like u have to pay to be able to do the fun brain training games, u dont always have to! at first i thought i wasnt going to be able to do anything worth my while until i realized that there was a ton of different games i could still play without paying! these various games are actually fun and help me use my brain to problem solve!! im so glad i found this app and hopefully after reading this u give it a try! i promise its worth it if u want to sharpen ur knowledge"
1,The Grandverbalizer,Take caution as this app will swindle you into being tricked into purchasing a subscription.   I accepted the 3 day trial and played through a round. At the end of the round I got a prize which was a percentage off of the subscription. You can‚Äôt proceed until you select a paid subscription. I clicked one and was immediately charged. This was within minutes of me accepting the trial.  The 3 day trial was null and void.   The App is Okay. But NOT that good.
5,cptpresidentlol,I feel like most apps like this either lack the challenge or is too boring. This actually kept me engaged and I have had no issue with it so far!
2,Zeelandgirl,It‚Äôs a great app but I can‚Äôt cancel my prescription. I contacted support and read everything and it says I can cancel in my Apple ID settings but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs harming my apple account as I removed my card and it keeps charging it so it‚Äôs an overcharge and eventually apple support will lock my apple account permanently. I can‚Äôt add a new payment method as it will simply charge it again.
5,ShuckyDuckie,"Been playing the app about to purchase yearly subscription usually don‚Äôt get into these kind of games, but loving the app and focus and never has been so much better 100% love it"
5,GeIIy,I‚Äôve suffered for some time with memory loss. I use this app to help me stay sharp & aware. This app offers great games to challenge your memory & how well you pick up on details.
5,Mr Neir,You exercise your muscles regularly. Why not do the same for your brain. I absolutely love this app! Instead of scrolling on social do something for your brain instead.
5,TinyTink76,I play this game with my grandson who is seven years old and he enjoys learning and using his mind a little bit better than what he would playing some silly game.
5,bettyswithbrains,Need a break from the daily stressors? Try this game! Impulse is a fun way to hit the reset button. I don‚Äôt usually (ever) play games on my phone (nor leave reviews) ‚Ä¶ yet here I am. That‚Äôs how much I love this game!!! Play it. It‚Äôs fun :)
5,falaykay123:,"I like these games because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting time playing them. I‚Äôm updating my brain, as well as recharging. The best times to play are the end of the day, or first thing in the morning."
5,IronicRonik,This app has helped me improve with my cognition. As well as problem solving quickly it helps improve your brain to understand situations quickly and solve it quicker ü•µ
5,brit022599,"It‚Äôs a fun way to pass time especially if you‚Äôre looking for a quick game to play. I have horrible long term memory so I‚Äôm hoping it will help with that, but the games are fun and interestingly challenging"
4,CandiChick86,"4/5 stars because of the fee‚Äôs associated with the unlocked version. But, it‚Äôs definitely a very entertaining way to pass the time away as well as train your brain! I recommend this to all ages!"
5,Bulletcoffeefan,I just got this app and I love it! I can spend the money amount of time or more if I want to and know that I‚Äôm improving my skills! Looking forward to seeing results in daily life.
5,Dobu2,There are a lot of brain training apps.  This one ranks as one of the best.  The training games are fun easy to learn with great tutorials. I have ADHD this app is great my micro short attention span  I would recommend this app to friends and family

5,D-Reviewer,Love the games and puzzles but i have a thing against paying for apps that seem like games. Get it though and i‚Äôm glad you can still do some stuff without paying.
5,Randallclan,"This app not only supports relaxation it also enhances  memory!  It‚Äôs nice to unwind, playing these games, knowing that you‚Äôre not only supporting your cognitive abilities, but also relaxing the noggin! Great app will definitely renew! üëçüëç"
5,marketlimit,"The app is user friendly, easy to navigate, and intuitive.  The exercises are mostly self explanatory and fun.  Great way to keep your mind sharp for years to come."
5,Raquel Realivasquez,Honestly feel smarter since using this app. Instead of scrolling endlessly on social media I‚Äôve adapted to doing these tasks daily. Very useful in the long run. Memory motivation.
5,bubbezzzs,This is a great app to download. It is very interesting and enjoyable. It feels good to learn about myself and do self-help in the privacy of my home. I am looking forward to using it every day. Thank you
5,Dayley99,I love this game! I have the free version and it‚Äôs helped exercise my mind in a way I‚Äôve never seen! Fun little games that don‚Äôt feel like school work! I would definitely recommend!
5,Neural newbie,Tons of fun laughing at myself while training and improving my brain. The games are fun and easy to utilize! I am setting personal goals and celebrating my sucesses along the way!
1,Tacokilllllll,i understand the app needs to survive but these tests should be more accessible cost wise. its unfair to hold the key over someones head and say that this explain many factors of how you interact in the world and make them PAY so much for them. this app is kinda messed up and sad that companies will do this for a buck‚Ä¶ also like im not sure on the accuracy of these tests and could not be correct.
3,OaklandPrettyAvocado,I really realize I am starting to slightly overlook simple details. These brain training exercises definitely keep my eye brain and hand coordination back in sink. I notice a lot more details and it has helped me in day to day tasks be top of my game. But it‚Äôs fun and stimulates me to continue with the trainings.
5,Mariano408,"I've had a good experience so far. It initially seemed easy, but now it's becoming a bit challenging. I feel much less guilty using this app compared to mindless apps."
4,SenpaiMeow,It‚Äôs a pretty nice app and the presentation is really great. Simple and intuitive to use. I only wish the subscription could be shared with with my Family for my wife. Really wish there were some disclaimers about that part.
5,PLWILL999,Love the different brain exercises and truly feel the difference after playing these games vs. other apps ‚Äúfun‚Äù games.  This has a different element of gameplay which I enjoy.
5,Miaegan,"Definitely recommend getting the app, I have been doing less social media more things interactive for my thinking and this is a great app for that!"
5,Gmema2u,"I downloaded the App only 1 day ago. So far, I have played approximately 6 different games. I love each game! I am excited to explore more of the brain improvement exercises."
4,Jupiter D. Jack,I love this app! Why can't I sign in from my apple account? Everytime I try to sign in it doesn't do anything and after multiple attempts the sign in love notif glitches and won't sign me in. What's the deal here?
5,JayneB11,It was an enjoyable few minutes playing the games while challenging my brain with something new and different.
5,desbev,I have only been using it for two days but so far so good‚Ä¶i have a mentally strenuous job and thought this app would help me stay sharp and unwind at the same time.
5,Sparkle 2334,First off there‚Äôs a lot of options but most you have to pay for to play or get your test results.
5,Hjd19852kids,I have only used the app for a couple days but like the different games. I also like that it tells you about your personality type.

5,Rnshopper,I‚Äôve only had it 2 days but love the levels of activity and different areas the app works on as well as the detailed summary of each activity.

2,Dudlwbflshdpfh,"Before when I played this I just skipped the updates bc I was too lazy and then I decided to update it. BIG MISTAKE. Before, there were absolutely no ads and premium didn‚Äôt exist and now there are ads with everything I do and things like checking my test report is unavailable if you don‚Äôt have premium."
4,Saturn/Marissa,"This app is great and gives you easy challenges for your brain. However it does have a lot of ads, more than other learning apps like duolingo."
5,KOglesby60+,"For years I have struggled with some brain problems, with programs like this I receive ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù! My thought usage has expanded with this program, I enjoy the challenges, even the harder ones. If you want to expand your mind I suggest you join in and keep going! There are games you can play that can help your scores. But don‚Äôt be too concerned about the scores except to see that you will get better!  Have fun! üòÑ"

5,Momma Alert,"I‚Äôm trying to train and challenge my brain, and this app does a great job in helping me do that. I‚Äôm also preparing for a big exam and these little brainy games is a great fun way to learn during down time moments"
1,nrbryant1956,"This app is setup to push for subscription repeatedly‚Ä¶ every game you try, every level you achieve, every interest you indicate leads to another ‚Äúspecial offer‚Äù for repeating payments.  Once you accept a free trial, you will not be able to cancel without being charged.    And by the way, their ‚ÄúIQ‚Äù test is not a useful measure of intelligence all by itself‚Ä¶ not at all.  This app needs work‚Ä¶ and boundaries."
5,Levies 4u,I think it‚Äôs excellent to play very interesting. I‚Äôve always wondered what I could do to help keep my brain sharp found it.
1,bigjim_,"The hardest puzzle might be making sure you don't click the wrong place and end up with a yearly subscription. The games seem ok, but it just feels kinda slimy. You just finished your first three games, here's a great deal that's the exact same deal you just offered for a yearly subscription on the previous subscription screen. How's that for memory?"
5,imaangelbutadev,"Impulse is an amazing app, I‚Äôm a gifted child and this has already improved my focus in school. I 100% recommend this app to people who wanna keep their mind sharp, educated, focused and engaged."

5,crefreshed,"I love the quick easy games. I already have tons on my plate and not much room for self improvement. However, this app makes it soooo doable."
1,lilleemomo,"I just downloaded this app and signed up for the free-trial. Oddly enough, I was still unable to access some of the features of the app. I couldn‚Äôt review reports of tests I had taken without being charged for the membership I was supposedly trying out. Very disappointing, I may a have continued the subscription had I been able to fully experience the app through the trial."
5,i will love the 4 life,"Impulse is not only good for memory, problem solving, and quick thinking, but it also is entertaining everywhere and you can play without WI-FI"
5,pharmmom0108,I have adhd and this game is wonderful. I enjoy that it has multiple different types of games and changes daily. The side games are also engaging enough to play and not get bored.
4,Taylorwulf,"I wish I had access to the other games, I‚Äôm not sure about paying for the year in case I don‚Äôt use it however I know it‚Äôs great for my brain! Very enjoyable, each game is short and fun makes you want to learn"
5,JMiller1602,This app helps me calm down when I‚Äôm having stress or anxiety. It can be really coming to just play the games and zone out for a minute. It also helps with memory retention.
5,mirmet131317,It‚Äôs a great app to add to something done daily. It‚Äôs easy enough to get through but gets more difficult depending where you are at and is worth a try.
4,DonHiser,"For some reason I cannot cancel the subscription for this app in my phone settings, but do not want a subscription.  Can you shut down my account so I do not keep getting charged?"
5,Adpo22,Impulse is a helpful step-away from the day and really helps me to shift my mind for just a bit and take a healthy break. It feels as if my mind has been decluttered and helps to regain focus to fi ish off the day.
5,tibergioyifecitdiy,I personally enjoy the mind games because they do indeed help with the brain and to better understand your brain power much recommend
5,GmaJuJu,"I love Impulse training.  When I do it more often or everyday I notice I‚Äôm able to focus more, make quicker decisions and stay more alert during the day.  My goal is to do it daily"
4,JanaBanana1971,Cool app. At the beginning stages seems easy then  progressively gets more difficult.  Free trial has many advertisement's between each game it‚Äôs hard to say if I would like the app enough to purchase.
5,planetc64,"So far this app is just what i was hoping for, fun brain training. Many, many games, learning a lot, very high quality. I will probably purchase after my 3 day trial"
5,Reserie,Good game to help you keep your brain active especially if you have a job that doesn‚Äôt challenge your brain in all aspects . Highly recommend
5,SugarBrown22,"I love this app. It helps with focus, sleep, and keep my brain health well. It actually helps to really sharpen your skills too. You will start to view things a little different now."
5,Qafui,I‚Äôve download a few freemium games and apps before impulse. I was skeptical at first but it really puts to shame all those ad-driven alternatives. I went premium and it‚Äôs been all I need.
5,Kimmy_Kat,I just started this game and it‚Äôs worth every penny an more. So far I‚Äôve learned what my strengths an weakness‚Äùes are and ideas on self improvement. Absolutely best game that I‚Äôve played in years!! Keeps you alert and sharp.  GET THIS APP NOW.
4,try this app now!!,This app is pretty fun and after two days I don‚Äôt have a problem with it though you have to pay for premium you can still do the workouts overall I recommend this
5,Icestees,"Hi, I‚Äôm a big fan of candy sort game, my question is, are the new levels designed to be only solved by adding a tube or am I not just solving it the right way? Thanks"
5,creative mothertrucker,It‚Äôs a great game because it enables me to strengthen both hemispheres of my Brain. Able to rewire my brain in order to help facilitate new problem solving ideas and creative ways to analyze situations from different angles.
5,Neicho10,This game is so awesome it test your skills shows what you really know and what you need to work on cause please believe me when I say learning don‚Äôt have a ending age anyone can always learns something more!!!!!!
4,97392827,This app is super fun with the games. The games can be stressful but that‚Äôs the point. I think that‚Äôs the point because it makes my brain work harder and when/if I complete the game I feel accomplished and like I did something really good.
1,tsz2fast,"Aug 2, 2022  I chose trial and this app developer charged me for a week. It is 6.99 for one week equaling 28 bucks a month! How this app is approved via the Apple store is unbelievable.  Regardless if this review is approved I don‚Äôt care because Apple and the app developer should know this price is a huge scam for what is offered. 28 bucks for NOTHING! I put a claim in for a refund as I chose trial as I do for all apps and then suddenly ‚Äúpoof‚Äù. The trial disappeared on their end. Hmmm"
5,Dk re,This is great for training your brain. Games are easy to play and learn. Play a game doesn‚Äôt take very long. Best is the limited game play per day so don‚Äôt get stuck playing games for hours.
5,Puiu33,I play 10-15 minutes before going to bed and I noticed improved brain stamina after few days. I believe the app is pretty well organized and fun too.
1,ToRi E g,"This app charged me two times for one month subscription that I forgot to cancel before it charged me, but now it charged me TWO TIMES PLUS TAX. I am beyond annoyed right now with no way to get my money back. Ridiculous. Want to help with peoples mental health but also wanna charge them for all of their money. Praying to get my money back because I‚Äôm in these hard times right now‚Ä¶ and every cent I need.. stupid app!!!!"
5,Kim Tru,"I‚Äôm enjoying this, working my brain in different ways. I‚Äôve started a habit of doing them in the morning bc doing these helps get me revved fit the morning."
5,afreyoux,So much better to spend time on this than some other meaningless game that doesn't challenge your brain. Great game to get your kids brain working in a fun way!
5,fjdjdkfj,I love this game cause not only is it fun but it is also good for exercising your brain the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the ads maybe if they gave you a warning before the ad that be awesome
5,Gsmart93,It‚Äôs pretty dope I‚Äôm a little rusty but the challenges are helping me break outta that fairly quickly especially since I‚Äôm down due to injury. Something I‚Äôve should‚Äôve discovered along time ago.
4,k@ylync,I found this game on an add for a game that I never really played but as soon as I saw this I new that if I switched to playing this my life would be a whole lot more fun and I was right this game is so fun and it says will improve your memory so it is a win win.
5,Trofee aka Fee,"This game is absolutely incredible it‚Äôs more than fun it‚Äôs challenging, and creative I cannot get enough of this, I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone no discrimination in regard to age heck and if its productive then why not!üòÉ"
5,LeahMc00,I almost never buy apps. I‚Äôve maybe bought 2 or 3 in my entire life. This one hooked me though and so far I don‚Äôt regret it. The games are quick and fun.
5,Tavatar6,I like that it has a system for tracking your daily progress. The games are fun and get more difficult the more you play them.
5,paedave,I have enjoyed playing the games and learning how to use more of my brain. Also to find my weakness and strengths. Thank you so much for sharing this.

4,Candle82738182,I‚Äôve only just started using this app and I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself and can tell my attention span and memory is getting much better. These bite- sized fun games have helped my brain become much stronger
4,Likee is horrible,I‚Äôm gonna be honest there are a couple things that I would change about this app one that you have to pay for some things but other then that good! I‚Äôm only on my two day streak but I like it!
5,crystalr01,The games will keep you engaged and looking forward to the next day's session. I like that you can see your score compared to other users. Great app!
5,blah lahblah1!!,Very easy instructions. Not to difficult but does require brain work and the more I do the easier it becomes to figure it out.
5,courtneywasherefirst,"I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgifted‚Äù person, according to the IQ testü§ì, with high emotional intelligence, The Orphan archetypeü´†, and a ‚Äúfight‚Äù trauma response. It‚Äôs only day one, and I'm having fun learning about myselfüò©üò≠ Just kidding. It has been interesting so far."
5,Romeroii81,"This really is a great app. Fun games and tests. Great way to learn more about oneself and keep your mind sharp. Can be a little pricey for some, but it‚Äôs worth it based on what it offers. I highly recommend."
5,Peluquera chula 96,Very fun interactive games that allow you to get some insight into your abilities and self. I was able to find out my IQ score with this app. Love the personality and trauma tests.
5,Trisha Clark,I am at an age where I am forgetful at times.  Trying to increase my memory and thought process.  This is really a great way to enjoy doing just that.
5,lorenzoshit,So I really enjoy Impulse. I just recently started. I‚Äôm just really bad at the math lol I do recommend this to anybody and I will recommend it to my friends and family. I love the challenge. Thank you Impulse.
5,Sunil Javali,I wanted to solve puzzle to improve my brain activity and I stumbled across impulse. I started loving impulse from the day 1. Everyday the complexity increases and trains you to think outside the box.
5,myIQis149,"The app gives me a nice prompted set of exercises each day, and helps me see where I stand mentally, even compared to others, and learn about what I should focus on to sharpen my mind."
5,Crystal loving momma,"This is a wonderful app. I‚Äôd use it every day I I could afford it. I‚Äôm a single mom on disability, and I don‚Äôt have the extra money to buy a years subscription. I wish I did! The app is great."
5,Fffffffcfffffssv,I‚Äôm just getting started so I cannot speak of any miraculous changes.  I can say that the exercises that I have participated in have made me think to some degree.
1,Limbonext,"The Candy Sort game doesn‚Äôt always fully register that you‚Äôve completed a level.  If you solve a level, it will unlock the next one.  But when you exit the game and then return, it often asks you to redo some of the levels you‚Äôve already solved.  I do have screenshots to prove dozens of occurrences, but the developer doesn‚Äôt seem interested in fixing it."
5,netofast,The most amazing part of this application is that it goes so intuitive and gives you the ability to rewire the brain having fun.
5,Taylorfan32,"Only my second day using this app. I really like how it‚Äôs put together, the gaming order, and do believe if I‚Äôm consistent my mind will be sharper over time using this app."
5,hannahbananananananananana,I got rid of my social media apps because I was tired of my brain rotting and my attention span thinning. This app is perfect to keep your brain busy and gives you a goal to work towards.

5,Dukesofsteel,A few games gets my mind ready for sleep. Much better than scrolling.
5,LJW-20,I just got introduced to Impulse yesterday and I have been going through the different activities. This tool is a great way to work my brain and have fun too.
5,dr.lethral,Thought provoking enjoyable experience.  Day two and I went searching for my daily challenge before the reminder notification.  God bless your good works.   Mentally awake and morally straight!  üôèüé©
5,everydaycray,"Great üß† training app.  I purchased the Impulse app this year, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it!  Really love the wide variety of games and tests.  If I was a puzzle üß©  person, I would enjoy the selection of puzzles  too."
5,ChooseLoveMusic,I was looking for a way to increase my quality of life neurologically but also do it in a fun way. Impulse is really the perfect combo for just that! I highly recommend üß†üôå
5,Kia Marie 74,"I never had gotten into these kinds of games but the games I love so many different to choose and I have noticed that my mind is more sharp and it relieves my stress , Relaxes me and keeps my mind focused"
5,Peet Mesquit,"Recommendable! The games make you think. They are challenging and yet fun enough to keep your interest peaked, giving you some consistent mental exercise!"
5,ElderlyEagle,I love this game.  It helps me to focus and improve my memory skills.  I need something like this at my age and stage in life.  It only takes a few minutes a day.
5,Jbeknowiiin,Definitely my go to when I want to use my logic. Love the variety of the game each day differently testing you and I enjoy the peer comparison let‚Äôs me know I‚Äôm on track ! Thank you
5,extramayoplease,I don‚Äôt like game apps because I feel like I get addicted and then waste a lot of time on them. This is different- I‚Äôm playing games but I‚Äôm exercising my brain at the same time! Win-win!
5,MC LV,"I‚Äôm really enjoying the variety of games,  puzzles and qizzes found on this app. Challenging without being overwhelming. It‚Äôs a Great Break to play a little, and hopefully improve brain function."
5,ALMFOTO,Simple and fun games to keep you sharp and focused.  IQ tests and other interesting activities help you learn more about your brain and why you think the way you do.
3,MARIAM M 13,"i wish when you PAY for a year, your account and process would sync with your other apple products. i downloaded and started on my ipad and the app on my phone doesn‚Äôt show any of my progress. pretty frustrating"
5,H_ZooMom,"I‚Äôm so glad I gave impulse a chance. It‚Äôs help keep me relaxed, less anxious, and challenges my brain to stay sharp. If you are on the fence just do it! I highly recommend."
5,KamKam209,"Very distracting! Something to do while your sitting down and trying to improve your brain as well, would recommend!"
1,Frstimer,"I tried out this app only to find its ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù a waste of time, very simple, no differentiation or response-based adjustments, endless repetitions of same type & level task, and no response after taking their unimodal ‚Äúintelligence test‚Äù unless you bought a subscription-just like the countless intelligence tests found on social media marketing click bait ads. Save yourself time. Avoid it."
5,RLW Tucson,I don‚Äôt hate the notifications or games. Usually I will not do any kind of video games but these do seem to create interest.
5,Official‚Äù The Dude‚Äù,Little bit to many adds but the service is free and they do deserve the money for their hard work.
5,Jenny in AK,I started a few days ago and I love spending small snips of time working on these skills. I‚Äôve replaced time I spent doing mindless things with activities that are improving my cognitive skills.
5,arojas8791,My mind feels more relaxed and alert at the same time after a few minutes playing. Plus I love the games! Most are super entertaining.
5,ninabuttons17,"I enjoy using this and it keeps me from loosing the sharpness and recall without the embarrassment of people. Wish it was funded another way, just can‚Äôt fit it in the budget."
5,KAHMED03,It‚Äôs really fun. Challenging games but also short enough to have just a few minutes a day to do something different.
5,BacardyT,"Super fun test, games, puzzles.  Progressively gets harder and harder instead of just changing patterns at same difficulty.   Great way to work your brain instead of scrolling on social media."
5,Martycruz,I am not one to play games online but this is more than games; it is really a brain workout but a fun one ! I am loving it so far and hoping to improve my mental clarity in many ways !
1,Tyreitz,"This app has so many paywalls behind it and the personality test and really everything in the app is so poorly done. The amount of typos in this app are comical. When being asked questions with two options for answer, they do not relate to each other in any way OR they mean the same thing lol. I don‚Äôt know who is paying for this or rating it highly but it‚Äôs terrible"
5,Lyricallfye,Really needed something like this to get my critical thinking going in the morning! I am a tattoo artist and crazy as this sounds- this app helps with my anxiety and focus before I start the day!
5,Daddy_Angel TNT,At age 72 I have questioned if my brain was still functioning like it used to because I sometimes forget little things; but these are great exercises that help me stay focused.
5,KensingtonPark,"I have played a lot of brain training and exercise games, and Impulse is one of the best! A great daily exercise system with the ability to play individual games as well."
5,kimmeebeegee,I find this to be a super way to spend an extra five minutes instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media.
5,Miss dee rae,"Much neeed social media break and wanted to try something new! So happy I did, it‚Äôs been fun for the whole family and actually making me use my brain as opposed to mindless scrolling!"
5,‚ô•Ô∏éñ¢†„ÉÉ·úäÍ®Ñ‡ºí‚àûÔ∏éÔ∏éñ†òñ¢†‚úÑ¬©,"It's a really fun and it helps with memory and helps your brain get stronger, I would appreciate if there was less adds though."
3,Abitofeverythang,I absolutely enjoy this app! I have been spending more time on here than social media and that has been great the only downside is the ads for the games that you display are absolutely inappropriate and disgusting. Basically it‚Äôs showing soft porn.
5,Erol Z,I love starting this in the beginning of the day to wake up my brain and I love using impulse at the end of my day to help me wind down. It‚Äôs a great app to use instead of watching TV
1,slaybaguette,its a good app ig like it was fun for the six minutes i played but like the first thing that shows up is paying for the app and i didnt want to so i hit the X and then when i got to the candy thing and ads started coming up like i thought this app was supposed to be about working on your focus but i cant focus when there is a ad at the bottom of my screen so the  i deleted the app.
3,GCZach182,I like the games but for the price I paid I am disappointed in how many times I have updated the app and there has been no increase in the amount of levels to the candy sort game. All game levels should be increased every time you update the app.
5,chdisksndbrji,This is like the best game ever I like it so much you can play so many different games and it helps you with like math and other stuff download this game trust me you won‚Äôt regret it.
4,Makenna Robbins,I love the impulse app because it gives me a good time to do some things and it helps me relax! I just want ALL of y‚Äôall out there to get the impulse app so you won‚Äôt have to worry anymore just get the impulse app!! It gives you A LOT of relaxation!!

5,daughterdaddy,"Made an impulse buy and bought it for a year. I‚Äôm a gamer, but tired of doing things that don‚Äôt stretch my brain out creatively. So I‚Äôm going to make sure the impulse was worth it."
5,big tech needs to die,This is the brain game app I have been missing and looking for. Don‚Äôt even think about not getting it just go back to the top of the page and download now!
5,random15139,"I‚Äôve had this app for a few months and it‚Äôs honestly great, the brain training games r fun and it doesn‚Äôt take up too much time. Lots of fun tests to take like the personality quiz."
5,Lmg1007,It‚Äôs encouraging to know that doing something on my phone is actually beneficial. I really enjoy the games and the daily training goes by quick!
4,Oma Ray,"I‚Äôve barely gotten started with the App, but so far I am liking the challenge! I‚Äôm 66, newly retired and have a mother that is deep into the final stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking and terrifying all at the same time. Lots of motivation to keep my brain as active as possible."
5,Double gawk gawk,"I‚Äôve been playing for about 6 months now and I‚Äôve got to say , this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played , the layout and everything just feels great!"
5,Wordgirl31,I like the fact that I am doing some thing other than watching TV I like to challenge myself and this gives me an opportunity to do that

5,RE5 BOY,"I‚Äôve only been using it for a few days now, but I really enjoy a lot of the ‚Äúgames‚Äù and feel like I‚Äôm helping myself and not just wasting time playing games."
5,Munoz185,I can tell by doing a few games that I will Improve my focus and memory.
5,Jaycie Wilcox,"This is a really fun game that jaleos strengthen my brain, but I don‚Äôt like that almost everything needs to be paid for. I would like it if we had access to more games."
5,Spirit 89,It‚Äôs challenging.  Tricky in a way. I like the interesting ‚Äútest ‚Äú changes. I also like the sound it makes when scoring my choices. Last but not least it‚Äôs fun and makes me smile.
5,rev_neumamm,"Keeps me from mindlessly scrolling social media, instead of Instagram I‚Äôll play 5 mins of games and feel like I have my brain a little workout."
5,taylorswiftgirl22989,I downloaded this game to help me have fun on my phone and think at the same time. I love playing games to test my brain power. I love this game very much. I hope this helps y‚Äôall greatly!
5,djhmon,I really enjoy using this app especially because I graduated a few years ago so this app makes me feel like I am doing something to keep my brain sharp
5,Cndo7,This app is so much fun‚ùóÔ∏èI had brain surgery which left me sleepy most of the time. When I interact with this app I wake up. Some of the activities resemble the testing doctors have given me. Thank you for this app.
5,NAR1109,I like that these games not only stimulate different areas of your brain and working memory but that they also show you how to improve
5,Taru :3,Impulse is pretty neat the more I use it. It‚Äôs brain games that I miss being able to play to work my brain. Would recommend downloading it and see what you think.

4,NL63,"The idea of playing something helpful to your brain health appealed to me and this app delivered enough challenge to make me think without being overly difficult. The only issue I have was the price is beyond my means. I enjoyed the free trial, worth trying!"
5,CoachSam60,"Impulse is a great way to get so many things going. Thinking, anticipating, dexterity, and just simple fun engagement.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give it more than 2 thumbs up!!"
5,jet614,These games have helped me stay encouraged and sharp. I really like the challenge of achieving new levels. It shows how your brain is getting better at the various skills.
5,LoveYouRekha123,"Recommending for step by step process of boosting brain abilities for those who have never worked cause of any other reason,this will help you go ahead..go for it"
4,warlock's,"It‚Äôs fun and easy but there are limited games because of the subscription that has to be paid to be able to access all the games and just the overall experience. Otherwise, great game!"
4,Audio1420,I just started playing and it‚Äôs very relaxing and challenging and it‚Äôs definitely good food for your mind‚Ä¶. I might be overstepping giving it four stars but that‚Äôs how I feel right now and on Monday number two I‚Äôve been playing  it so like I saidüòÅSO FAR SO GOOD!
5,BoomCrazy,Impulse is fun‚Ä¶and frustrating in the best possible way. Only suggestion - make a confidence booster test that you always score super high on after scoring so low on everything else! ü§£
5,Sakindele,I can feel myself getting smarter! Great workout for your brain. Feel I reactivated a feel cells üòä. I set myself achievable daily goals but planning to aim higher and workout twice a day! Great app!
5,Jenniluckygirl77777,I tried this because I have MS and my cognition can get really fuzzy with mostly short term memory. I‚Äôve just started using it but I think it might help me. I can update later
5,boraskz,It helps train my brain and reminds me that my brain is actually still smart and fast working. My second day so there‚Äôs still a long way to go
5,ZSImoney,Fun games and I feel the reason I downloaded the game I‚Äôm getting that. At least I feel smart playing the joint. Only my 2nd day playing so I‚Äôll leave another review soon!
5,TalorFletcher30,I am in recovery and was having negative thinking couldn‚Äôt get out of my head and was overwhelmed with anxiety and came across this app it helped me calm myself long enough to think thru what I was feeling THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH ü§ûüèæüíØüíØ
5,Esdes_,Just started using it but the games really test all different skills. Took an IQ test and will take another at the end of 2 weeks to see what my improvement is. If any.
5,Saddomm1133,"I just started playing these games 2 days ago. The main reason I downloaded the app is because I seen it helps with you going to sleep. And let me tell you, it ACTUALLY HELPSSSSSS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è I LOVE IT"
5,Lourdes Cordero,IAbsolutely love playing this game it‚Äôs challenging interacting on top of the fact that it captivate mean it keeps my attention which is really hard to do so thank you you guys are awesome keep up the good work
5,JoJoJodster,I love this program! I have slight short term memory loss from a car accident a while back and this program is getting my brain to work.
5,Nakia10,I‚Äôve been using Impulse for a few days now and the brain games are really helping me feel smarter. I look forward to the more challenging levels.
5,Legand 63,I thing the app is very useful and fun to kill time I‚Äôm in college and edit videos but sometimes i get bored or frustrated and this helps kill time at times overall its really good
5,Lin4999,This is actually a lot of fun and it‚Äôs quick! Easy to take less than 3 minutes to help your brain!! Highly Recommended.
5,Porkchop&chunky,This was something that was not like most games. It's not boring they switch up to keep it interesting and you have the ability to change speed. Nice Job!!!
5,Jackie9712,I took the time to review because I believe I have finally found the best brain trainer app ever!  I have tried many! This one really understands your brain and how it works!  Thank you Impulse!
1,AquaDragon911,"Like many other people, I tried unsubscribing from the app before my 24 hour trial period was up. This is impossible in app, and the app does not provide you with any instructions on how to cancel further payment! I found out that it‚Äôs been charging me for months even after deleting the app‚Ä¶only because a different app had redirected me to my iTunes subscriptions page to cancel a separate subscription. It‚Äôs a trap. Stay away."
3,GR159,"I have had this app for a month, I am not sure if it‚Äôs doing what they claim it does. I don‚Äôt see any consistent results in my preference. Sometimes I do great on a task, other times not se much. I am not sure I would buy it again. I definitely can‚Äôt recommend it at this point."
5,BusyDadof13,You will enjoy improving with this easy to understand but still just the right amount of challenge app.
3,9lives,"The graphics of the games are flat & not immersive, which is notable at the outset, but recently over the past few days the game will not start & there has been no acknowledgment of an issue from the app developers."
5,Amanda8207,It chooses the exercises and doesn‚Äôt over do the time you need to spend on them. Can play for a little bit or for hours.  üëçüèªüëçüèª
5,Uothasdope,"What better to spend a little of your free time improving yourself. The achievements this app gives, helps motivate you to do better. Try it out!"
5,Gonnzo,Just started using but enjoying it so far. Instructions are clear & mini-games aren‚Äôt terribly difficult (yet). Look forward to my daily dose!
1,Britistheshit,"I'm not sure why I was charged for the free trial, instead of given the 3 days free. And im also not allowed access to any reports, without upgrading. But I was supposed to have access to pro for 3 days and then charged 6.99. Instead I was charged 6.99 and don't have access to anything except the tests which said that my IQ was an 89, which is insulting to say the least. This is a junk app."
5,theklausmeister,Been playing these games for two days now.  Hope to improve my mental health after some time.  Entertaining and simple.  Thank you.
4,Dino lovers,"When I take any of the tests it only tells me what I got it doesn‚Äôt show me what it says it would without buying premium or whatever. Please fix this, my mom won‚Äôt let me buy it but I want to know what I got!"
5,wendilyn1826,"I like the challenge, the fun, the way it makes you think.  I also like to know at 60+ I‚Äôm still able to be quick and accurate."
5,I Live to tax,Testing your ability to use your brain gives you a good feeling (or not if you don‚Äôt do well) based on your achievements.
5,Lizette582,I was getting kinda frighten with my memory lately. I‚Äôm 31 and this is easing my mind that I‚Äôm on the right path. It‚Äôs also helping me concentrate and decompress. Definitely worth the money
5,Dstclair,"This app is engaging, fun, and useful. I can‚Äôt wait to get on this app daily. I look forward to playing the games. I know I will improve on my critical thinking skills by using this game."
5,stevefh82,"These games are quick, fun and they keep my mind focused. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a 10 minute game break to stay mentally sharp throughout the day"
5,Unhappyscale,Just started using it. Enjoy the tests to work my brain without all the ads from these crazy other games.
5,1Butterfly Queen,"Great mind games, it builds your speed, visuals, and ability to figure out the game you‚Äôre playing. I would definitely recommend this app to others."
5,wackywalb,"Not sure if it actually helps yet but the games are easy, different (not the same thing over and over) and fun! reminders help"
5,Whutchuwant,The games are quick and it‚Äôs more stimulating than playing a game on your phone plus it helps with your memory.
5,Amyjo72036212,I really like using this app so far. It is a fun way to strengthen my mind. The games are varied and there are a lot of levels. I wish it didn‚Äôt cost as much as it does though.
5,aaaahhbdodnbn,"This app makes me feel good about myself in a way i never felt before. It sharpens my brain and body. Really great app, thank you so much! Can‚Äôt wait for more updates ü•π"
4,Raptortrainer89,It‚Äôs not to bad if you don‚Äôt pay really you just can‚Äôt see your full results unless you pay I just wish you could see some of the results for free that‚Äôs all other then that it ain‚Äôt to bad
2,bee.11,"Seems like a great app and the quizzes may be helpful however they don‚Äôt tell you that you don‚Äôt get your results for the quiz unless you pay. I spent about 15 minutes on a quiz and I could not read the results without paying for a weekly, or monthly subscription to full access."
5,9893107man,I really enjoy the challenging puzzles and get a kick to see how well I performed against my peers. Anyone on the fence should go give it a try. You will most definitely not be disappointed!
5,phyL2014,In a world where we already get lost in our phones; I enjoy doing something that isn‚Äôt mind numbing. I‚Äôm also competitive and enjoy seeing how many of my peers I am beating! Haha!
5,doxa04.v,"The games are fun but also challenging, definitely a better time consuming game than playing things that don‚Äôt train your mind."
5,Lissyjoycross,"Love this app! It has a ton of games to choose from that are designed to help strengthen your brain. If you are a curious person like me, Impulse app also has a bunch of different test for IQ and personality."
5,Ijijjijjijjijjtgrdwswdy,It help me so much that I am interested in doing so much better things thanks to this app and improved in so many more ways thank you so much
5,Kramer329,During a day when I‚Äôm constantly grinding away with coding I open this game to take my mind off what I was doing. I feel relaxed after playing a few games
5,Bgreen418,"I‚Äôve never heard of brain training, but once downloading this app I have noticed a huge difference in my way of thinking and concentration and so forth. I hi  go my recommend it!"
5,Impressed_4_Impulse,"I am just getting started, but the game ‚ÄúImpulse‚Äù offers a wide variety of cognitive testing through using speed as a metric. The diversity of games are fun and I want to stay engaged."
4,MisMaria1969,"Day 2, and I‚Äôm seeing what I believed to be true. I‚Äôm hoping this practicing will me overcome some of these obstacles‚Ä¶ I have a very difficult time and they cause so much anxiety. Hoping this will help a-leave some of this anxiety so I can have a calmer more productive life."
5,Rivers Coop,I love these tests although they can be difficult and confusing. They challenge me and help me to understand my own skills and what I‚Äôm rated against my peers. Good stuff for the spirit. Good Luck everyone.
5,Youngpro15,"Extremely helpful to do before work or school each day, wakes up your brain and processing skills. 10/10 would recommend."
5,BuleSilver88,"This is a fun and easy way to help improve your mental skills, boost your IQ, and improve your life. Would highly recommend for both kids and adults."
5,Ms.Kendra91,"I didn‚Äôt go very far in school, and I‚Äôve been wanting to go back to get my high school diploma. This is helping to exercise my brain and get me prepared to learn again! Challenging, but fun!!"
5,Rbones 68,At the very least try the free trial. I found quickly that I enjoyed this and once I played the free trial I got a 96% off deal from Impulse. It ended up being 56 cents a week.
5,ComeBloodyAngel,Great app I can get lost in all the puzzles a problems it presents me and It‚Äôs interactive so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve wasted my time. Like I would scrolling trough short videos
5,Cfizzla,"Rather than swiping through pictures of people you don‚Äôt actually talk to or see IRL, use that time to actively keep your mind engaged."
5,Patience81,It‚Äôs fun and I love it but I think it needs to be free. I don‚Äôt know why you have to pay to strengthen your brain especially when you‚Äôre old.
1,?!$&nickname,"Did you really just push an update where I am forced to watch an ad? I installed last week and was considering buying because I was enjoying the games, it was rather lovely to have an unfettered experience not tarnish by ads and then I updated and play one game and am forced into an interactive ad that will not progress unless I interact with it. That‚Äôs atrocious and I will uninstall."
1,DCMarvelGirly,"So I did the 3 day trial and immediately cancelled because I wanted to play before I decided to subscribe. Also, I can‚Äôt really afford it right now, I thought it looked fun. I can‚Äôt even get the report without signing back up for a subscription. I don‚Äôt want anything from the developer, I just want it known that I will be deleting the app and it won‚Äôt be on my phone ever again."
5,TarynES,Accidentally became addicted to this gameüòÖ very fun way to text yourself and even shows what percentage of your peers you performed better than. I think that‚Äôs why I keep playing ü§£
5,JJay H,"I really have boosted not only my intelligence but also my confidence!! My performance & all around character I‚Äôve been informed, has been nothing short of amazing & beautiful!! Thank u!!!"
5,An improvement in scoring,"In the first couple days, I‚Äôve found these games quick, varied and interesting.  The feedback is quick and motivating."
5,DanishIrish,"I strongly believe that if you don‚Äôt keep challenging your brain, it won‚Äôt get stronger and with age it will start beginning to have more cognitive decline."
5,gdxcgffffff,This is just the best! Know I have something awesome to help me with my wondering brain and the synapses fire off just right. I feel great! Finally something to challenge my brain and give me focus.
5,Kotlc book reader_Tam song,This app is amazing you don‚Äôt even have to buy things for it to be great. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing and it‚Äôs good app to waste time on or if you want a good IQ test non the less it‚Äôs amazing
5,Mowowmeow,This is a fun way to keep your brain sharp. There are brain exercises that include puzzles to solve and games to play.  There are helpful questionnaires included to help you discover more about yourself.
5,ninja.mattydea,Quick or longer if you want. Lots of different games to help keep your brain sharp. Plus metrics versus other users to stoke your competitive spirit.
2,Apria64,I would enjoy this app if it wasn‚Äôt overloaded with ads. Every time you begin to relax there is another stupid useless ad I never watch because I‚Äôve seen them all and they couldn‚Äôt more irrelevant. So don‚Äôt bother unless you want to watch ads two thirds of the time you spend on the app. I‚Äôm pretty sick of ‚Äò‚Äòem myself.
5,Karisma B.,Trying my brain.  Immediately caught my attention.  It‚Äôs a delightful time while using my time wisely playing the different games. I will continue to play not only because it‚Äôs fun but beneficial. Thanks.
5,Liono23,Games help me mentally get through my break ups with 4 of my girlfriends and when my great grandfather died falling off a step stool and when my mentor passed away from getting in a fight with a pedestrian.
5,Immmmmmms,I think that impuls is a great app but 1 thing I don‚Äôt like is that u don‚Äôt have veary much time but other than that I think that u should definitely get the game if u like challenging things
5,Whbrawer,I love the trainings and look forward to them. I was hooked right off the bat and am using this app to stay cognitively agile. Highly recommend for the fun as well as the brain training.
5,The firery speedy hooman,"When I first downloaded this app, I didn‚Äôt understand how fun it was. It also improved my memory over time. All of the mini-games are really fun. I recommend this app."
5,MemenanaGG,I have used Impulse for the last 2 years. I've never found a brain training program better than impulse!
5,Magic_Rogue,Look forward to my ten minutes of brain exercise. I love learning and this is a fun way to keep my mind sharp and ready to focus on other tasks.
5,PositiveChil,A couple minutes a day and it can help with many different aspects of daily brain functions.
5,3303popo,Can help keep your brain fresh over the summer for school or can just help it perform better. Don‚Äôt need a pro version or anything to play either!
4,Rpcykp,So far I really enjoy this app and like the different aspects associated with it but have only had it for two days so I can‚Äôt really give an honest evaluation yet
5,love your themes,It is so good and it has helped me so so much. I tried so many apps so when I saw I knew I had to try it and I ask so happy I did because it is all I have been looking for.
3,Zoo revue,"It‚Äôs fast paced, it‚Äôs creative, it‚Äôs enjoyable. That‚Äôs it. I would rather play the game than writing a review. I am sure there are people with a lot lower IQ than myself would like to express their intelligence in this review. Thanks for the game. Thanks for the challenge. Please don‚Äôt ask me to write another video review."
5,lolkfjfjf,This app is very good for brain training and making you smarter! I used this game just for two days and already notice a difference and my ability to focus!
2,Phthylo,"I miss one time purchase apps. This app is cute, so I hate to leave a bad review, but it is insanely over priced, and I just wasted 10 minutes (72 questions) taking a test that‚Äôs results are behind a paywall. There was no disclaimer that ‚Äúyour test results won‚Äôt be available unless you pay,‚Äù which genuinely infuriates me."
5,SarahMascara,It‚Äôs challenging. It‚Äôs fun. Play as little or as much as you would like to. My memory is sharpening. My brain is getting a workout every single day. And I look forward to it. Great app!!
3,hddicbx,"I subscribed to this app for the ADHD type test to better understand myself, and there is no test for it anywhere.   The puzzles they had are fun and quick, but even with reminders, if I‚Äôm not in the mood to do them, I don‚Äôt. Will not be renewing my subscription when it runs out."
5,Brian6876,I have been using this app for two days and have definitely seen improvements.
5,Sosmoovematt,"This game really helps me with my focus, consistency, and concentration. (Which is something I personally don't hone in on) therefore, these games help me increase the attention/time amount spent on what the game is asking me to do!"
5,britt.bish,Whenever I‚Äôm feeling blah and like I can‚Äôt think stressful I play on this app for a few minutes and it really helps my mood and brain function!
5,TheNaJoKing,"Is fun game, and is nice to help my brain with small games like these. üëçüèº"
5,Peterbau99,It‚Äôs a nicely made game to train your brain everyday. Unlike other games that just recycle old questions or puzzles and gets very tiresome or boring.
5,Tininilove,If need t achieve a small sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning or any time of day‚Ä¶ impulse is the way to do it! I‚Äôm excited for every challenge I‚Äôm sure you will be too!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
5,Garc√≠a-Haro,It is a great APP just a little bit at a time helps you feel sharp! You may be surprised! Don‚Äôt think about it. Get it! Try it! You will look forward to it!!!
5,Dab dab da great,Yet to properly feel the effects of this but the games they have us play make sense on how it‚Äôll keep our minds sharp. I did only start yesterday.
1,anonsocmanager,"These games and app are all really disappointing and kind of pseudoscience-y. I tried the quizzes, puzzles, and games and it all seems very strongly driven by pseudoscience. I‚Äôm coming up on the end of trying to use this app for a year and I can say I‚Äôve been happily using Elevate for ~120 days straight - I disliked this app by comparison enough that every time I use it I feel disappointed in wasting money on it."
5,Kimberlee B.,Doing these exercises has lifted my brain out of a fog!  These are great ‚Äúgames‚Äù that literally leave me feeling energized and fresh for my next task at hand. Best app I‚Äôve bought!
1,DieselC123,"I signed up for a lifetime subscription‚Äîwhich, I would believe lasts A LIFETIME. And after 12 months I was sent an annual renewal reminder. I sent a help request, which never got answered.  Honestly, I love the app. As a cancer survivor I struggled with brain fog from chemo and the games on this app helped me a great deal. I just don‚Äôt appreciate the misleading pricing and would like to have my lifetime subscription restored."
5,brandonmorningstar,By far a wonderful app! Easy starting levels building up until it‚Äôs truly challenging! It‚Äôs engaging and one will never have a dull moment on this app!
2,JerMusic27,"If you‚Äôre not going to pay for this subscription, do not bother to even try this app.   During my trial I was over ran with ads, trying to get you to buy games, and I couldn't even use the app for its intended purpose. It may be better once you pay the subscription, but it‚Äôs not worth trying for me."
4,KLM..,"There are a lot of adds, but you can pay to remove them. It also takes a while to unlock different games, but the free games are really fun. And they are challenging. Some of the games do make me mad tho."
5,Ninja warrior 10,"This set of games is a more welcome distraction than social media. If you have ten minutes, sharpen your brain instead of scrolling."
5,hdhdhdjrjfh,I like how not a lot of things cost money and how everything is kinda perfectly playable and not to many ads overall great game definitely helps with adhd
5,TTBrowns,Trying to exercise my brain a bit more. It seems to work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to keep at it. The games are challenging but not too hard. I enjoy it.
5,EssDeeEss,I enjoy playing these brain training games. They are a lot of fun and a great way to fill small moments in time knowing I am doing something helpful for my memory.
5,qadrpartyof7,I‚Äôm only on day 2 but just that fact that I know I‚Äôm doing something with my spare time better for me than scrolling on social media I think is worth it.
5,colliben,Usually get bored with things like this after a couple days. Impulse provides a ton of variability in the activities so it always feels like something fun and new.
4,Not Seth 2023,I love this app don‚Äôt get me wrong I have a berry hard time with math and it helps me sharpen my minds but they want you to start a free trial and crashes a few times I still love this app though and think everyone should get it.
5,Bmorty72,I am suffering from a TBI and left leg amputation following a motorcycle accident 4 years ago and I‚Äôm am trying to find ways to recover both my mind and body.
5,Shauna Kimble,"Impulse is an extremely fun brain game! It‚Äôs got interesting results and IQ, EQ, and personality tests. Seriously if you‚Äôre looking to know yourself better, build confidence in what you‚Äôre good at and strengthen weaker areas, this is the game for you too!"
4,Chenzo4u,The puzzles and workouts are fun and get more challenging over time. I don‚Äôt like the picture puzzles as the logic is often convoluted and the pictures are often not detailed enough to make decisions about.
5,Jordan Syd,"This game is absolutely amazing. I have a brain injury, and it challenges my brain in all the best ways. I took a personality test and the end results were scary accurate. I highly recommend this game."
5,ReetyBird,"Very fun way to improve memory. The challenge is definitely there, but the fun of doing the exercises makes it feel like a game. Definitely worth trying out."
5,Ignacio el Original,"I suffer from anxiety and whenever I feel like my anxiety will hit I try to play this mind games and it help reduce it. Because it keeps me busy in something else, I recommend this game"
5,MariaBonita74,"I truly like this app because they present you with challenging and engaging games that help you to improve your concentration, orientation to detail and focus. Plus they help your mental math skills to stay sharp."
5,zmoari,I always feel really accomplished when I use Impulse. And I‚Äôve noticed a significant difference in my processing time. Highly recommend!!
5,Rubiredo,I‚Äôve only downloaded the free version. It‚Äôs been pretty fun I‚Äôm sure the paid version has way more games to play. I think it‚Äôs worth giving it a try.
4,Timmy iShimmy,I enjoy the app a ton but would love it more if I could involve my family without having to pay for each of them to download. Are there any plans for a Family Plan of some sorts?
1,mx_nih,"Their training games are good, not anything other apps don‚Äôt have. The ads and pop ups asking you to pay for a subscription are a bit too much. What really bugged me was the ‚Äútests‚Äù section, they don‚Äôt mention anything about having to pay to see results, so you do the entire test only for them to then inform you that you need to pay to see your results."
5,kokesita,I love it only takes a few minutes and is also entertaining : )
5,Richwog69,"Definitely recommend if looking to challenge your self, sharpen your mind, work on your memory or problem skills or simply unwind"
5,Camelot time,Really good thinking games to stimulate the mind. I have to really think about each game but they are still not too difficult to figure out. Just enough.
5,1lameusername,I like that it really makes you think. Each stage appears to build on each other. It‚Äôs also helping me with my lack of memory. 1lameusername
5,me-sgk,It‚Äôs fun and i believe it does help your brain as youReview of  keep improving your score with practice.  The different areas that you practice are interesting to perform as well as enjioyabke while you are performing them.  C good
5,Tdiggadee,I can be kind of a scatterbrain so this takes my mind off of everything that‚Äôs happening around me and makes me focus on what I‚Äôm doing right now
5,CMumea,"By far the most engaging and fun app I have used in a long, long time.  I can‚Äôt wait to see how it helps my cognition over the upcoming weeks and months. Thank you!"
5,momasof2020,"I chose strengthening the brain! Definitely a great option, I love the games, love that there‚Äôs morning, mid day and afternoon suggested ones!! Love that they are quick. ‚ù§Ô∏è definitely becoming one of my go to apps"
5,Ghost rooms?,The variety of games and the nuerodivergency of the exercises really helps improve cognitive skills and challenges me in ways I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of. Highly recommend !!
5,hernandeeznuts,This brain game is so amazing. I could play it all day. I‚Äôve tried so many brain games that are not good And don‚Äôt work for me and this one is just really really great. I am so happy I found this brain game!
5,TIZLUV,I have only used this App for a few days but I am truly satisfied with workouts for my brain. I suffer with High Anxiety and now when I am struggling I have this App to help me stay focus.
5,miss.ladyolivia,"A great game to play to pass time. I‚Äôve played this game when I couldn‚Äôt sleep, while I wait at doctor appointments, and  in long car rides. I feel it‚Äôs a great way to exercise my brain."
5,Ludachris2530,"I have trouble retaining a lot of things and this app really helps me in all aspects plus it‚Äôs really fun as well. It also encourages healthy habits, like doing 20 squats and avoiding sugar.  I highly recommend this app. I love it!!"
5,MrFckYoBtch,Other brain game/teaser apps are more like riddles as oppose to this app that actually has games that help you build and exercise those cognitive skills I love it! You should download it.. Do it.. Don‚Äôt be a puss..
5,mic reg art,I‚Äôve been playing 10 mins a day and I can see my mind organizing information as it presents itself in a much more efficient way.
5,SofiaJ.,"I really liked this app, but I only wanted the triel. I downloaded it today, how can I cancel it before I get charged for it? Is that possible or will I need to give approval after the three day period to purchase it? Thanks!"
2,youremusty,"I'd like to at least say the content is good but there's an ad after almost every click that prevents me from really focusing on the puzzles and everything else. I get you have to make money somehow, and a subscription isn't very expensive at all, but dang. Did I download an application or an advertisement farm? I'll stick to Elevate."
1,MonsterTakeOver,If you want to pay for it go for it. But if you‚Äôre like me and hate ads and hate that you have to pay for a subscription. Then don‚Äôt waste your time. I turn off the data for every app. This game will not let you play without data or wifi and you need to buy a subscription to unlock the content. Oh and there‚Äôs ads! The ads are just the cherry on top of their revenue
5,Zorojuro3000,"Lots of fun games to sharpen your mind, only takes a little bit of time out of day! Better spent doing this than scrollingüëçüèº"
5,Homie671,The tasks are challenging and fun.  I look forward to this each morning. I‚Äôm not a person who plays games much at all but I love challenges. A great combination of both.
5,AugustKukuk,"I wish you didn‚Äôt have to purchase anything, or lock into a subscription otherwise it is awesome!!! So glad I came across it by mistake"
5,Bremarie1994,I‚Äôm learning more about myself and challenging my brain daily. Hoping that the long term results will help with my memory and cognitive abilities. Enjoying it so far!
5,MBPDR82,"This app is an intriguing blend of fun and challenging. The games progress at a pace that keeps you enthralled and focused. If you‚Äôre looking for a game you can‚Äôt put down, pick this one up."
5,TX_Mom,I got the app because I saw that it had the connect the pipes game but since I‚Äôve gotten it I‚Äôve discovered all sorts of other ones that I love too. It‚Äôs a great way to pass the time.
5,Mot0r0609,"Colors, games, instructions everything is easy to understand and makes you really practice your brain love it"
4,Person1848,I don‚Äôt like that you have to pay to see your results but at least it shows you at the top of the screen. I couldn‚Äôt choose but I would give it 4.5.
5,tltcdm,"Fun games, but you have to think, and read the directions. I‚Äôm liking this so far!"
1,PapaMike25,"I quite enjoy the app, but despise subscription based plans. I was offered the lifetime purchase in the introduction to the app before even seeing its functionality, and now this option is no where to be found. Very underhanded method to get people to pay monthly instead of just purchasing once. Deleted on searching for an alternative."
5,Nikitabonita1,I love Impulse so far.  I‚Äôve only completed a few training games but I'm enjoying myself & learning a lot.  I‚Äôm looking forward to more difficult training. üëç
5,Bmp912,"I was hesitant at first when I saw the Ad for the app on TikTok, but once I downloaded it and used the 3 day free trail period to test it out, I was pleasantly surprised at all the brain quizzes and exercises it has for your brain to train."
5,Cccoolman,I like this game it is good to see your accuracy and how well you do compared to others.  Always good to work the brain a little.  üëç
4,Shoyt79,I really like this app but I feel like my daily training is the same puzzles over and over again. The side games are fun. I prob wouldn‚Äôt purchase another subscription.
1,DarkSF01,"Actual time waster, TO BE HONEST. Only wasted like 9 minutes of my life, but gives me enough information to know what the app is like.  If you‚Äôve saw an ad on Instagram or Facebook something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat type of ____ are you? Test now‚Äù You CAN find those types of tests on the app, and you‚Äôll spend a few minutes filling out and answering the questions only to be greeted with ‚Äúsubscribe to us to see full report!‚Äù You literally just wasted 5 minutes answering questions to see nothing.  What a useless time waster money sucker. You can find better tests just on google for free, so you‚Äôre way better off with that."
5,vamp_snake_83,It‚Äôs really fun plus the price is not bad specially for whatever month do you start it starts from there and goes until next year of that $28 is not bad $.56 is not bad
5,sammifromdabloc,I really like playing these games and I like to see what my scores are and what I can better improve on after playing.
5,Edyalpsid,It‚Äôs very accurate and I believe it can test u in every which way possible even to tell u if u got heart or not I love it for myself I believe it‚Äôs a great app to have it‚Äôs worth the download
5,ksgurl1000,I love the variety of games. I can feel it making my brain work harder to process what information I‚Äôm being given.
4,Jherold81,"I like the app it would be nice to see when it states you out performed a certain percentage, if it showed you the amount of people that make up the percentage. Just a idea"
5,Ndewitte,Finally found an app that allows me to play games while exercising my brain and helping my overall memory and reaction time improve.
5,Pepper8969,"If you love playing many games after another or want to relax, this is an awesome app. The tests and quizzes are also fun. Just remember to go to an actual doctor and not diagnose yourself!"
1,Addierahh,"Basically they say hey take a free trial to see if this is right for you ,right? Then with each test you take, it requests that you pay for that portion of help for the category. So basically it should say,"" here you go... a good waste of time. Take quizzes but you don't get to find out the answers for them unless you pay."" F your free trial you accepted. Because only the quizzes are free. Nothing else."
1,Flappingsparrow,"Yet another app that hides its price from you until you‚Äôve wasted your time on setup. Just tell me up front that you want $7 a week for puzzles so I know not to download.  Edit: the developer responded with lies. I downloaded the app again and went through the whole onboarding process again to double check. Maybe I just missed the free option right?   Nope. There is no free version at all. You get 3 billing options and a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù. The free trial is 3 days, and then it switches you to weekly billing. This is 100% not a free app.   I don‚Äôt care if you want to make money on your app, but stop with these scummy smoke and mirror tricks. Just be honest that the app costs money."
5,_iSNOTNiCK_,"Great way to replace doom scrolling. Fun games, interesting quizzes, and easy to put down and come back to rather than getting pulled into the electronic void lol. Would highly recommend!"
5,Chickenfried,It has fun games that help you perform better mentally. I could spend hours on impulse and not get bored its fun to see how you compare to others in your age group.
5,Brittybobitty69,"I‚Äôm only on day two but I think it‚Äôs amazing. Its entertaining and it makes my brain feel smahhhht. Well not super smart yet, but knowing I‚Äôm at least average helps for the time being. Haha."
4,FNAF OTAKU,I‚Äôve not been playing very long but the games are engaging and versatile and genuinely helpful. The small bite sized segments you do each day keep it from getting overwhelming. There are plenty of badges you get as reward which is good motivation.
5,ZiggyRicky,I‚Äôm starting to realize I need to work out the brain muscle. This is a fun way and I like the progression to harder problems as you move along.
5,Louieb_fit,It‚Äôs very stimulating. I can see where this can help prevent memory problems down the road as I get older. I‚Äôm in the health/wellness field and this app will be very beneficial to me and the clients I refer to it!
1,JustTrixie,"I liked this app at first so I went ahead and subscribed taking advantage of a discounted subscription price.  I‚Äôve been playing daily for about a month now and it is the same 5 or 6 games every single day and they are now BORING!!!  I want to cancel my subscription but lo and behold, they make it nearly impossible to do so.  I would recommend staying away from this app."
5,Susan OP,"I love being challenged,  however I am doing this on my cell phone and the typing is too Small to read quickly.  Any solutions for me?  Thanks so much!  This is great fun!"
5,JC Mixer,"Great game to improve mental acuity. Even though I‚Äôm in my 40s, I still feel like I need to keep my mind sharp and this game app is what I need in my opinion."
5,Airsoftlobr,I love the quick few minutes it takes and that I am staying active in many different ways.
1,Baman AC,"In using the Free trial, I was offered a subscription (1yr) for $6.99, I accepted. However, the amount charged does Not reflect the advertised price. Additionally, prior to the 24-hr free trial, I‚Äôve cancelled my subscription. I‚Äôm can not Trust apps on Apple due to such deceptive and false ads.  Requesting Apple to remedy this situation. I want a full charge reversal/refund and the ‚Äúvendor‚Äù/‚Äúseller‚Äù/‚Äúdeveloper ‚Äú be sanction.  This has been a huge waste of my time."
5,Our class,Just starting the free version and loving this app. Feels like it‚Äôll be exactly what I need to keep my mind sharp as I  age. I like that it‚Äôs got a lot of variety and it keeps your interest
5,Ahneria,It is good it help me to relax but most stuff like this you always have to pay but I didn‚Äôt and I can still get a little bit better
5,Milsnickens,I have experienced some brain fog as I have entered my 40s and it has made me feel crazy. I invested in this to help me get my mental focus back. So far I really love it. üëçüèºüëçüèºüòä
5,VSüòÅ,"After my brain spending 10 hrs a day on my ‚Äúday job‚Äù, this app really keeps my brain stimulated in different area from what it is used to."
5,FaithNoelle97,"I‚Äôve been enjoying the app a ton so far, it‚Äôs only my second day but I do think it‚Äôs helping keep my mind more active through the day"
5,2cutthroat4leah,I love the app I feel like it‚Äôs improved my cognitive ability.I only with everything would be free so I could further develop my mind thank you
2,Sabesey,"The games were mostly fun, but I went through the entire IQ test just to be hit with a ""pay to proceed with results"" page after I completed the 20 MINUTE quiz, and i was using the 3 day free trial. They want you to subscribe before receiving results for something that's supposed to be for fun, or pay an extra $5. Unethical practice."
5,Chikezie Victor,Keeps my mind sharp while being on my phone instead of mindlessly scrolling on social media. A great way to start my morning
4,PuzzlesRMyLife2,I love this app but there need to be levels added to the games. i have run out on most. Been waiting a long time. I play on it every day. I feel it‚Äôs not updated enough for the more than casual user.
5,Gavin Leroy,"I love it so much, not only does it help with your brain power, it‚Äôs also fun. And it just catches my attention and then I just wanna play it!!! Definitely a 5 star rating from me!!!ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô"
5,cChriistyy,"I love the games, and puzzles impulse has! I love to play brain games, this is my favorite app so far. Highly recommend paying so you don‚Äôt have to deal with the Ads though."
5,Wendy_Jo,Funny little distraction throughout the day to keep your eyes and brain sharp. I like the diverse group of games each session vs. the redundant games. This game is for everyone. Just get it.
5,grchhgfdhgfdhgfd,It‚Äôs so good I learned how to do this in 5 seconds and it‚Äôs good for ur brain I had to redo college but once I downloaded this app I understood a lot of puzzles and things in life so thanks!
5,Bella_xoxo:),"I love it because there are not too many ads, and it is still easily playable without premium. I love the games and they are simple to play ( they can get tricky though haha)"
5,megs9443,I have not sprung for the version that costs money yet but I‚Äôm definitely considering it. The memory and mental math practice games have been helpful since having a tbi.
5,Rachelmn76,I love this app! It‚Äôs a super fun way to train my brain- I use it everyday. I especially like the quiet reminders it gives me to take a quick 2 min break from my day and play a game / train my brain.
5,Kittycat3378900,Great games to keep the brain sharp! Takes a few minutes a day to play the brain games and give your brain a workout!
5,Fireking226,It helps me work my brain and use logic and thinking skills. If I had the money I would most definitely pay for the full version
5,Collino888,Literally the most fun I‚Äôve had on a game in a very long time and helps me focus and concentrate when I keep getting distracted while doing homework
5,Colorbee2005,I feel that playing brain games can help keep your brain thinking and challenge yourself to help you stay healthy!!
5,Bambi Luv,"Before playing this game, it was hard for me to remember everything. Now I‚Äôm starting to remember things little by little. All due to playing this game everyday."
5,Adonissssssssss,I enjoy the daily brain exercises that continue to improve my skills daily. Impulse is very informative and easy to maneuver through the app activities. Thanks to the creators for Impulse!ll
5,Reilly221,"Honestly really opening. I never get this much from an app, but it‚Äôs a mental opener for everyday and a 10/10 recommend that DOESN'T require a membership on download. Love it."
5,ScariestList,I found this game as a sponsor add and decided to give it a shot. It definitely is fun and keeps you on your toes. I found it good to play between quick breaks at work.
5,camzerker,I find this app very helpful to training the brain like you train your muscles. It‚Äôs fun and keeps you focused while increasing the way the mind thinks! Would definitely recommend.
5,Redzilla72,"I just turned 50 and I saw this app and thought I would give it a try. So far I love it, it makes you think. I give it 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è"
5,Noodles762,I have used this and similar games over the years.  This one is more engaging and fun than most.
5,Lynettieo,I like that it changes to new game instead of playing the same thing over and over
1,DougieFreshSoCal,"I had only used this app a couple times, and promptly uninstalled it and canceled the trial subscription. 7 days later and it insists on charging my family‚Äôs plan payment method for another week of the PRO version. Who can I contact about this, the data will show I did not use this app for more than 5 minutes, and I uninstalled it.   Just a warning."
5,X_Jc113_X,"I really found this app as something that I actually look forward to. It really has helped me with problem solving and more,"
5,Bolch44,Brain fog is no joke after 40. This app is full of fun and challenging but quick games to challenge you. I look forward to my brain gym sessions everyday.
4,AntonioIsSoCool,This game is fun to do like once or twice throughout the day. Sometimes I find myself stuck to it and it‚Äôs not a bad app to be stuck on. Training my mind has always been on my mind and now I can finally do it.
5,Emmoly getsin,This game is really good I‚Äôm working with your brain and I love how you get to play different games to set your brain I never knew you could use games get better like really fun games
5,DemiKit666,It doesn‚Äôt even feel like you‚Äôre training your brain. You get to play all these fun little games that also help your brain in so many ways.
4,AliveAndFree,"I don‚Äôt have much time during the day or evening for that matter, but Impulse gives me a chance to build the muscle that matters most‚Ä¶my brain. A quick round or two of brain games and I feel sharper."
5,_app.lover22_,"Having adhd and not wanting to take medications, this game is a great alternative. The game taught me to slow down and think about my next move. I found it to be a great game for helping me."
1,Metroguest,This app tricks you with easy puzzle on Instagram and tricks you into thinking only smart people can figure it out (which makes you want to prove you‚Äôre smart because it‚Äôs obvious what the answer is and we all love feeling like we know the ‚Äúright‚Äù) answer. Once you download its $30 or some joke of a fee. I might put a dollar for puzzle app. But not an annual fee. What a joke.
5,Faithier29,"I‚Äôve been trying to find an app that‚Äôll help with my memory, test my IQ, sharpen my cognitive functioning, etc., and this app has it all! I truly would recommend this app to anyone."
5,gingermidge,It‚Äôs been an easy habit to start working on the brain every morning and just before bed. Addictive format makes you want to continue and improve. Grand game!!
5,PvtJoy,"I thought the games were going to be easy, but surprisingly I was challenged, especially with the basic Math.  I think the game is great but over priced."
5,acm2022,I struggled with short term memory for awhile now. I have been doing the targeted memory games to work on it. It‚Äôs great! They are short and fun. I recommend this and my brain feels younger already! -acm2022
5,rrraquelll,This app really helps you when you need to fix something that you want to get fixed. So your not insecure how your Brian works.   You should get it!
5,AtlasV3,"Impulse is fun, creative and actually challenging enough to to hold my attention. I‚Äôve noticed several day to day benefits just from using this app in the short time that I have!"
5,kevinspelican,Hi get this app it's not even that expensive and you'll probably like it and it's good for your brain. don't you want to have a good brain? i sure do. that's why i got this app
5,AldoG.,Honestly a really good game to kill time with and challenge yourself. Keeps me interested too with the different games it has and the challenges too.
5,TezIsAwsome,I started using this app two days ago and I‚Äôm loving it and it‚Äôs been a great experience with this app when I have spare time and just need to wind down a little bit
5,beautysilverstar,"The Covid headaches really damaged some of my memory. This games is super awesome gets my brain moving & exercising. Fun quit games too. Btw I‚Äôm intelligent, just finished grad school but noticed my memory isn‚Äôt 100% so grateful for the fun brain teaser exercises."
5,Misfortunekw,"A lot of fun, super entertaining and I can see the difference in reaction and memory in just a week üôåüèº highly recommend for people trying to challenge their mind"
5,KattU2309,I‚Äôve tried a few of these apps and this is by far my favorite. There‚Äôs a lot of variety and the games are straight forward and fun.
5,sassem18,"I love doing the test and seeing what I get, you do have to pay but there‚Äôs SO many other things you can do for free. You get daily workouts (for your brain) and lots of fun games!"
4,Mazatlan Layla,I love this. It is challenging and fun and I know it is not wasted time playing because it is keeping my reflexes sharp. I have read over and over since my last ‚Äúmilepost‚Äù birthday how important it is to keep your mind active and challenged.
5,rashaado,"Gotta be honest it‚Äôs challenging and from my perspective also beneficial for anyone that downloads this app. Not a waste of time and with so much variety, there is plenty opportunity for advancement so yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a keeper!üíØ"
5,Sixtring87,Definitely noticed some things going more correctly in my head the next day after using the app.
5,theemcee3,I ended up playing for an hour didn‚Äôt expect to be this hooked. And the ads aren‚Äôt bad just after every game it doesn‚Äôt interrupt in the middle like some do
5,Sahuggs,"I have severe memory issues at 47, and the games help you to focus, force you to think critically, and all of the games are so diverse. This is the best thing I‚Äôve downloaded this year!!"
5,Tootie Loveeü§çüíô,This is the best game app because it literally has EVERYTHING all in one app you could really learn from this app plus play all kind of games üíôü§çüíôü§ç Keep up the good work come out with more app‚Äôs like this !!!üíØ
5,DaisyMonea98,I love brain games. Every morning I wake up and challenge my brain and the olds games I had were getting worn out (too easy to beat) so this game is definitely just for me.
5,Thee blessed,I love how they have different challenges for a specific function to improve on. The interface is pleasing yet fast without any glitches or delays.
5,That Guy 4356,"I‚Äôve never really used this kind of app before, but this definitely gets me to think a little clearer after a series of brain teasers with daily reminders!"
5,Taysllim,"There was an ad in a game for a game that wasn‚Äôt in a game.  That game was in this game all along.  This game has all the games you have been looking for but didn‚Äôt know you needed.  You lick my brain, I‚Äôll lick yours."
5,Ally_MN,There are three games that take about 3-4 minutes a day for training. There are optional games you can play too. Like their own version of Wordle.
3,S Is For Spirit,The free to use version has a bit too many ads. I understand it‚Äôs free but one between EVERY  is a bit much. I think it would be better to be one at the start and one at the end and then one after a set of three for tower of Hanoi.
1,Honest thoughts 54,Be care it automatically puts you down for $40 a month as soon as you get the app. I got the app didn‚Äôt think much of it and deleted. I downloaded as a free app and trail. I looked at my statement 2 months later and I had been charges $10 a week the whole time with a deleted app I was never on. I was also denied my request at a refund. One of those sneaky charges that gets you before you can catch and cancel it.
5,halftoad,App does make you use your brain and really think about each game you‚Äôre playing. I can feel my IQ going up as I type this out.
5,#CKSolution,This game allows you to think quickly therefore it helps you to bring decisions to the forefront of your mind‚Ä¶
1,JayyT09,"There are ads every single time I go to the next round. They are NOT spaced out accordingly.  It only takes a few seconds to complete a level and then BOOM, an ad that‚Äôs worth a minute or two long! If there‚Äôs an ad at least every 10 levels or so then I can tolerate that. But after one level each????  Such a waste of my time and so not worth it."
5,DespinaCherie22,I enjoy exercising my brain üß† with the games & challenges. It‚Äôs better than mindless scrolling (which can be fun too) all the time. It‚Äôs good balance.
5,proy1978,I‚Äôm just starting out but it‚Äôs a nice way to see what I remember academically and memory strength. It compares you in someway against your peers who‚Äôve taken it too so it drives me to compete lol (I do not pay for it)
2,homicidepiinksÓÑΩ,Before the ads I would use this app daily. Then they added the ads and now I can‚Äôt even THINK about using this app. The ads are excessive and on top of that they‚Äôre long. It gave me anxiety. Only way to use comfortably is with paying a ridiculous amount. It‚Äôs giving very much greedy energy.
5,xeroninja,"Hi I‚Äôm Becca and I like it it‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs confusing, so can you fix that? I am trying to get good but it‚Äôs confusing again,"
5,kitcatkittycat369,"If this is helping my brain to remember thing‚Äôs better, it‚Äôs the best app I‚Äôve purchased. It‚Äôs fun it gives you great feed back and now I‚Äôm waiting to notice the results."
1,Celia71,"I read reviews of this & gave it the trial, which was just ok, but never authorized beyond for the insanity of the $7 per WEEK fee, nor did I receive the ad free version that I was charged for. I maxed out 2 levels of the games within that timeframe which never update amidst the barrage of freezing up unclosing ads. There is better out there without scammers"
5,Tennessee Chic,I saw this advertised on Instagram. Downloaded it and it‚Äôs been. Didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôm not really using my brain until I started these games. This is a great way to train your brain.
5,durgigl,After only a couple of days I am already noticing changes in brain activity.
1,jclyonsmama17,"I signed up for a free trial and before the trail was even over, they took a weekly payment out. I tried to dispute this with Apple and they are not refunding my money. An app to help people‚Äôs mental health has a confusing pay system and then steals from the same people.  Update: I was happy to see the game responded to my review in hopes of a resolution but all they commented was #N/A. Zero help and still no refund."
5,SB Addicted,"Love this app!!  Not only is it fun but I actually see improvements in my focus, memory and mental processing speed. I recommend it to anyone looking to stay sharp and enjoys challenging themselves!"
5,Lizkea,I love these games especially as a day break from social media and other distractions. It also helps me calm my mind and brain before going to sleep.
5,Jamebroo,The games are fun and start out slow so you can work yourself up to more difficult games!
5,Noli nuggy,"I have only been on this app for, like, two days and I already love it! I have recommended it to a few people already! This is not a robot review. I really like it"
5,Simplelyfe101,This is something good to be addicted to because it helps you be intuitive about your abilities.  Great for keeping your brain engaged and not addicted brainless games.
5,tskrtrm,Just got started but I can already see how the training will work. I‚Äôm happy to give up the games ads and spend my time here!
5,kimberlya777,This app has so many fun games that appeals to any age. It‚Äôs fun and trains your brain to adapt to a better way of thinking. I recommend to anyone who wants to strengthen their cognitive skills.
3,cajetane,"Why does this app not keep correct count of the games I complete? It seems totally random as to whether it keeps score or not, no matter whether I use the buttons to leave the game or it times out. Seriously annoying."
2,hilvca,The Candy Sort game makes me redo levels I‚Äôve already completed if I leave the app and reopen it. It‚Äôs really frustrating. Otherwise enjoy the app and games.  Updating‚Ä¶I cancelled my subscription because of the repeating levels. Makes the game frustrating instead of relaxing.
5,sosavi,Love the stimulation  Easy and also challenging. With lots of other options for insight into the way your brain works! recommend
3,Anither fraudulant game,"Impulse is a pretty good brain training game. Although I think that the individual, mini games are a little bit on the easy side. I would like it even more, if they were made a tad bit more challenging‚Ä¶ Pretty good game, though. I will continue to utilize this app to SHARPEN  my mind, EVERY day, Unless o FORGET to‚Ä¶"
5,JayeHoward,I‚Äôm definitely enjoying the Impulse app! It offers great challenges and is great for a refresher on subjects/topics I haven‚Äôt had to use in a while.  Its helping me to relax as I wind down for the night too!!!
5,NaeNae14!,So far this app is very intuitive. Had a seizure some months ago which affected my memory and I‚Äôm using this to help it along. So far it‚Äôs not hard.
4,Idk üíÄüêç,"It‚Äôs helping me focus a lot and stay connected, I‚Äôve noticed how when you take a test you have to pay to see the full document and I‚Äôm not too happy about that but it‚Äôs a pretty good app"
1,Sebastien666,"Nothing but advertisements. I signed up for free trial and IMMEDIATELY cancelled it but APPLE decided they would go ahead and try to charge my card and now I cannot buy ANYTHING or update anything from the App Store!! I just went through this 3 weeks ago!!! Apple has completely been run into the ground and is a terrible, greedy company whom I used to adore! I‚Äôve had every iPhone but iPhone 5!! But I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE EVIL, GREEDY FRAUDSTERS!!!"
5,..Kierrraaaaaa..,"I rarely leave reviews, but this app has been really good for me when it comes to unwinding and giving attention to activities that are beneficial for my brain."
5,Patrolin2k,It‚Äôs been along time song I‚Äôve enjoyed a game of any sort. I really enjoy this game. The math portion makes me laugh because I really need to think about the order of operations.
4,Toe461,This game is so fun but you have to pay on some things but I really like it I have played for a month now and have learned so much this is the most relaxing game that I have played in my 15 years that I have been alive
5,kkkhhh8,I‚Äôve enjoyed the app!! Lots of games to pick from and they become harder as one levels up. Glad to know I‚Äôm improving my brain while having funüéâ

5,Limbusa,Just started a few days ago. The variety of challenges is impressive and it keeps me motivated.
5,JeanieVan,"Great app.  You challenge yourself with a variety of games, and you get feedback on how you compare with others.  Let‚Äôs see how it advances my everyday performance, but so far, 5 stars!"
5,New York KC,"Unlike many other games, this one helps sharpen your skills in a multitude of tasks! Each game will have you using your brain to solve the puzzles. It‚Äôs so much fun!"
5,ChrisF522,Fun and sometimes challenging games to keep your brain sharp. Also a bonus that the games in the ad are actually the ones you play.
5,Tracillia,"Honestly, the fact that I am learning something from it is just a plus! Better to get on here and train my brain than mindlessly scroll"
5,hunting the best,It keeps your brain sharp. You don‚Äôt have to get the subscription because the ads aren‚Äôt every minute. Also you get a lot of stuff for free. Love this game.
5,Harmione4ever,"Being recommended by a TikTok ad, it might be good or horribly bad. This app was neither. In the first five minutes it was great! It was fun and tested your brain! It‚Äôs a great app and I definitely recommend"
5,slimsdanna,This app has sooo many games and things to unlock. Definitely recommend trying it out over other brain games.
5,Top jam,This game has really helped me with my mental memory and is actually a lot of fun. I opted to get the years membership. My mother and great aunt both had Alzheimer‚Äôs and I think this will help me to keep my mind active. Great fun.
5,JanninePrice,I really like this app. The games are fun and the personality tests are fun as well.  I like the push notifications to let you know when it‚Äôs time to do your daily games.
5,NikkiKim,This gives me something productive to do on my phone rather than mindlessly scrolling social media or any other time waster.
5,Kaila_Fay,"So far, so good. I have anxiety so I really like the basicness of the game. No loud noises or too much going on. Just enough to throw my eyes off, but not enough to send my anxiety soaring through the roof."
5,juiyv,If you wanting to improve you memory processing speeds whatever it may be this is the app for you
5,cristyü§óüòä,This app is absolutely amazing cause it actually helps train your brain and you can choose what you want to focus on to help.I couldn‚Äôt recommend anything better ‚ú®
5,muffinmaster72,It‚Äôs a must helps so much as long as you start slow and are consistent you will see a difference
5,#zi,I just had the opportunity to play and I really loved it because I could see my ability to focus and I have ADHD and I can improve a lot here. Thank you
4,Curator R,"I am playing my first try with these games. I feel like my recognition reactions are faster than my manual reactions because of unfamiliarity  with game layouts, but it is fun in seeing the challenges to get better."
5,DonutDuple1222,"I cant put my phone down, this is literally the most fun I‚Äôve had playing an app in YEARS. And I can tell I‚Äôm getting faster at the games and puzzles!"
5,Butycheeks,These games actually teaches you to allow yourself to think and play and it keeps the mind woke at all times
5,medicShelly,After suffering a TBI- my memory and attention have been greatly reduced. This game is more like fun and not a test.  So far so good.  I‚Äôm able to stay focused and find myself wanting to do more.
4,unlucky in love 2021,"If you know, then, you know this takes time and agility, which makes you focus on what you doing is tedious as well as intriguing but you‚Äôll enjoy what you‚Äôre doing"
5,ninjagardener420,The games are fun and challenging. The tests are fun to do as well and offer a nice insight as to where you stand. Worth it and definitely notice a difference when doing ex rides to keep my brain sharp
5,random person3676885455,Amazing üëçI love this app it has helped me with my stress and I fell better now that this app has been here! ‚ù§Ô∏èbut I also think the ads need to go. Although it is great I give 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
5,datkangel12,I like that my phone send is notification when I need to start brain training. The exercises are explained well and easy to follow.
5,Awhitty,A good way to work your brain when you need a break. Could see this as being a useful tool for my clients suffering from TBI‚Äôs. I got this to try it out to use in therapy
5,killeermoode24,If you add this to a daily to do list along with other things to do you will definitely see more success in your life
5,crusty boii,"A very nice game to keep you focused,at first I didn‚Äôt think that this game would be fun or interesting but when I played it, I ended up really enjoying it."
5,batmansego,The games are fun and they work as a great fill in when I‚Äôm doing nothing at work.  I subscribed for the year. It‚Äôs worth  it so far. Just trying to outdo myself with each new game.
5,prettygirlwolf,I love this game because you can customize your goals. For example I picked memory training and basic math and now i can easily remember stuff. Plus they barley have ads.
5,SW Fitness,As someone who takes care of their body in all aspects. It only makes sense that I exercise my brain also!
5,Jlar2000,Of all the brain training apps I‚Äôve tried this one is the best!! The games are simple and fun! And it‚Äôs also free!!!! You don‚Äôt have to pay to get all the games or anything like that!!!
1,ynddhuwn123,"THE WOEST APP I try so hard to cancel the subscription that I mistakenly got. But this company really just want to use our money. So it cannot cancel in its APP. Also, when I write in there support the message cannot be sent. It is said like that. So that it is really difficult for people to cancel. And even in their website they gave us a fake link to contact itunes. What kind of company it is....."
1,joanna96r,I got this game because I saw an ad on Instagram. The game was for connecting the dots. I opened the game and I was so confused. I just wanted to play the connect the dots game where you have to connect two dots without overlapping. So annoying. I‚Äôm tired of these ads on Instagram that advertise a completely different game and when you download it it‚Äôs not what you thought it was going to be >:/
5,urmomhasspermbriws,It‚Äôs very fun and helpful with memory and math and I‚Äôve only had it for two days and it doesn‚Äôt force you to buy thing‚Äôs every five second
5,CoolestMan43,It‚Äôs wonderful and is relaxing and u can do it even if ur 13 üò±üò±üò± I love it and my girlfriend has anxiety abt like everything and I gonna show her it covers a variety of subjects her highly recommend
5,In Growht,It‚Äôs a five out of 5 because it helps you with your brain and it helps you get smarter with growth and I think that‚Äôs right because it helps you get smarter by getting older

5,Minecraft women,It has many different games. I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm playing the same thing over and over.
5,1st fawnderella,This is fun to challenge yourself and exercise sharpness. I love that it shows how you rank compared to others and I can see where I need to better my skills. Very fun!
5,RockstarsOnIce,This is a fun app!  Different mind challenges.  Some easier than others but the purpose of getting you thinking is the goal and it is met!
5,Maukido,This app is the right amount of challenging to keep you on your toes but also adds an element of fun to keep you wanting to do it. I highly recommend it!

5,BJ Passion,"The exercises are so much Fun! I enjoy that there‚Äôs daily exercises, along with options to play individual games and their levels, also personal testing for different topics"
4,yvette714,They seem quite simple and sometimes they are however sometimes they are somewhat challenging so it keeps your mind spry. Good job. Please do not sell my information or I will be really mad and leave a no star review.
4,Tsm_God*,I have this app four stars because it is a good mind game app and also if you want to play in again in the same day you have to pay other than that and the hardness this game is actually pretty good so download it
5,TeKk $,"Hey I‚Äôm TeKk $, I started this game about a week ago.  With being only under the surface of the whit sharpening game, I already feel way more sharp and much like a brand new rubber band, snaps back with a quickness!"
5,GerryFromTheBlock,"I was briefly mad that I got so little for free, then I was addicted, paid for it, and now I feel the price is extremely reasonable. I don‚Äôt spend money on games, so that‚Äôs saying something."
5,Karolee1,Good mental exercises. I see people struggle with memory loss and loss of mental sharpness. Some of it can be diagnosed but much of it is just due to lack of mental training. (Becoming brain couch potatoes!) This is easy exercise for the brain!
5,ACT121317,This is the first time I‚Äôve ever used a site like this so I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to expect. Impulse is amazing! The games are not too easy which I like as a challenge. I highly recommend!
3,Danse,"Fun games, fun app: does not track progress properly at all. I‚Äôve been playing everyday for 20 days in a row ‚Äî has reset the streak 3x and once said I played 23 days straight??? Also, I‚Äôll complete a game for the day and it lists no games completed. Frustrating!  Otherwise, so far I‚Äôve enjoyed this app."

5,Iwatchtoomuchnaruto,Impulse is a thought provoking app that can challenge your mind and help you with focus. Additionally it has iq tests that you can just do on your phone. Really 5/5
5,my_kenzie,"I‚Äôve only had this app for a couple days, but it‚Äôs honestly so worth it already. It feels like a game app, but at the same time I‚Äôm training my brain and learning!! I love it."

3,B_r_i_d_g_e_t_h_,The app seems really cool until you spend 10 minutes on a quiz and then it tells you you need to pay to unlock results. I understand things aren‚Äôt free but be upfront before a user starts an activity.
5,Dani Twin,"I am still discovering the app in it‚Äôs entirety, but I already know it is fantastic! Can‚Äôt wait to see the improvements, which will definitely happen! üí™üèæüòÉüëèüèΩ‚ô•Ô∏è"
5,RalphyPolo,"Games and improvements in brain functions are a green light from me. Fun, challenging, can observe progress, enough data points to figure out something‚Äôs about yourself. Love it."
4,$h‚Ä¶,"Although it‚Äôs a good game, I dislike the amount of ads had. Every time you win two rounds an ad pops up. Even when you leave the game you have to watch an ad."
5,Raul Gonzalez Monreal,Tried the 3 day trial and ended up buying the yearly subscription before my trial ended.  Probably the best brain app hands down. I‚Äôm a male 41 years young and this app helps . Highly recommend
5,DiFlumetelli,"I‚Äôve only begun playing the Impulse ‚Äúgames‚Äù.  At 65, and having had a parent die from Alzheimers dementia, I want to do all I can to stay as sharp as I can throughout my life."

4,CadeNelson,"The ads are a little to frequent and anything even tho you can skip them after about 10 seconds, but the apps pretty nice and simple."
5,SAlitaK,"I just got it. Most of the games are simple for me. However, I don‚Äôt know my IQ. I like to think I‚Äôm a  genius. But hey  give it a try. It‚Äôs just brain exercises.  Not like it‚Äôs gonna kill ya to work it out."

5,JesusG512,"This is a great way to improve your brain activity. I was bored one day and just wanted to keep my brain busy. It costs but if you got spare change, it‚Äôs worth it."
1,MaryOfTheHill,"I decided to give this a try with a week long free trial but it charged me for an entire year?! I went through the steps! I canceled the trial within a week! Yet it still charged me for the whole year the MOMENT I signed up! When I went to the website to reach customer service, the site was down/having issues‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt help but feel scammed at this point!"
5,ndjdhdkanf,"I was surprised at how engaging this app is. The puzzles are fun and they can be a challenge at higher levels. Overall, worth the money for the subscription"

4,Zeeeds,"Its been 2 days since i have downloaded impulse and i must say its great but i dont think i m still ready to give it a 5 stars not because it lacks in any segment,I simply havent tried all of it yet"
5,aliwheel423,The only problem is getting more levels for my favorite games I‚Äôve already finished. I really hope they add more levels.
5,YungChop,I‚Äôm new to it so I like it so far I want to see the difficulty increase throughout the days as well as it keeping track on if I‚Äôm bettering in areas
4,Songstress 92,I work and go to school. I‚Äôm over forty and impulse helps me with my memory. It also feels good to have little successes when you‚Äôre always on the go. It also helps me with focus and concentration.

5,rex_easily,Fun brain training games. Great way for me to wake up before logging into work. Allows me to have a little fun in the morning and helps motivate me to start my day!
1,MizMoonbeam,"I love the idea of this app, but I couldn‚Äôt do much with the free trial to even see if it was worth paying for. The test I wanted to take, which was advertised to get you to try the app, wouldn‚Äôt even let me see the results after I‚Äôd already signed up and agreed to pay after the free trial ended. You had to pay for results even under a ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial."
5,Bustervana,So far I‚Äôm impressed with what I‚Äôve seen. I have also noticed that after only one day my brain feels like it is waking up.
5,Daly 22,"I am enjoying this. It is easy to use and provides with this statement, make you feel confident, no matter what level you are."
5,Thenikksmeister,"So hopefully it actually does help memory and focus, but overall at least all the games are fun. I paid for a year so I still have to see if it helps regain mental acuity"
5,Juju bean nuber one,I love their little challenges that they have and how if you need help in certain subjects you choose it and it will help you to learn
5,Terilr1,I am so glad that I decided to try this app. It‚Äôs a great brain exercise. I actually enjoy it because it‚Äôs fun and challenging at the same time. I highly recommend the Impulse App.
5,sarahros3,I can‚Äôt remember what tests I have done so far but I know I really liked them. A real app that actually uses content that means something. Thank you.
5,aaaarg im lonely,"This brain game is the first one that actually does what it says it will, it helps me to focus on this instead of what could be going wrong in the world . Creators of impulse thank you !!!!"

5,gabby.uwu,"Definitely helped me with my memory, and the activities aren‚Äôt boring to me. sometimes i forget i‚Äôm even helping my brain since the games are so addictive"
5,Sadie and zoeys mom,Like I‚Äôve downloaded games before and deleted the app within 10 minutes . I actually like this impulse thing !!!!!! It‚Äôs challenging! In a great way .

5,carly01nn,I love the variety of brain exercises to keep my brain sharp. As we age keeping a great memory together can be challenging. I‚Äôm hoping that things will improve
5,SDRAMZ,Most other apps are the same dull tests but this is something new and different. Give it a try!
2,Jodymancody,"The app itself is a good idea, but without paying a yearly membership all the game and quiz results are locked behind a pay wall. I feel like games like these if they were free would do so much better and they could collect revenue from another source."
5,Catlady01327,I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but I love this game it really helps work your mind and focuses on the area you want to work on ! I love puzzles and challenges so it‚Äôs definitely worth it

5,steve dove,I really love brain games and impulse is one of the best I‚Äôve played. I was really good at trivia games but Impulse is a game changer as far as brain games go it‚Äôs brain games that never stop. Hats off to the creators of Impulse.
5,haughtharper,This game is so great! It makes you use your brain and exercise it. This will help my memory problems also! I would recommend this for anyone!!

5,Ginsbachc,I really enjoy the games as they get harder each level. I can feel my my hand /eye coordination and response times increasing with each game and level! Great app!
5,mkanatzer,I absolute love these kind of games and puzzles  But I can‚Äôt handle the f‚Äôn adds and I‚Äôm not paying 40$ to remove the adds that‚Äôs cost to much money. Soo time to delete your game
5,lokkgg,"Fun to do with my son, my favorite activity is tower of Hanoi, that‚Äôs what captured my attention in the ad and I gets soooo challenging but it‚Äôs fun to try to figure things out"
5,totallyawesomegurl,Omg this is amazing I have had so much progress and there are not even that may adds and if there are it is only for like 5 - 10 seconds
4,maks10111,Fun and good warmup to the day. I like the idea of the app. But when I bought the free trial I got none of the perks. I did the personality test and it kept trying to get me to buy the yearly and monthly plans when I already had the free trial. I‚Äôm wondering why that is
5,Stella's Still Got Her Groove,Really enjoy Impulse. I need to give social media and tv an break. It‚Äôs a great tool when my mind gets bored and wants to be stimulated. It also keeps my basic cognitive skills sharp.
5,D.Meatrie,"I came across this randomly and it has been awesome. I can see the areas where I need improvement and also, the puzzles are a blast."
5,Thugadoug,Fun better then a lot of these repetitive games this  keeps it refreshing and new you never know what your gonna get when you log in.
5,Meggie balze,"The games nice tho,just that it contains a purchase where you‚Äôll have to subscribe either monthly or yearly and not everyone can do that. But apart from it the apps the best."
5,ChristinaJo82,"Other then the little commercials you have to watch, this game is worth downloading if you have some time to spare, and want a little mental challenge :)"
5,JarodMic,"Simple games that test my focus, I was looking for a source to test my attention and speed, this app seems to have a lot of depth for people who wanna focus on various things"
5,**LanceT**,I love playing while I'm unwinding from working all day. Gives me the mental bump I need to finish up my day and relax at the same time. It's like jogging a cool down lap at the end of a marathon.   Well done.
5,bpsmx001,"There‚Äôs a wide variety of games to play, so its very fun, on top of being challenging. Helps get the blood flowing to your brain in the morning or anytime you want to train."
5,Trucker_Z,"I‚Äôve got a few brain training games which all I enjoy, and this one seems to have all those apps! Such a convenient (and fun, of course!) app!"

5,willieop,Makes your brain wake up and actually work instead of steadily wasting time and effort watching someone else do the work
5,mini-lobo,"It has help me improve my thinking process an speed, also able to keep it a challenge"
5,WarumonoMac,"Compared to similar products I used in the past, Impulse has a very carefully curated selection of tasks and mini-games with a very carefully tuned adaptive challenge. Highly recommended."
5,den-ben67,I like the variety of games. A dr will tell you as you get older that you should play these types of games to improve your memory. I think this is just what I needed.
5,@nc.nightman,"This app allows you to be challenged everyday even if you‚Äôre very busy, take a few minutes of your time and train your brain"

5,Chrissy poo only,Gives your brain something else to think about besides social media and who‚Äôs posting what and who liked your stuff!
4,Nivea1223,"When your brain is declining this game is a great way to exercise your chops. Also, if you do a lot of waiting in line or waiting at doctors offices, instead of complaining or getting upset, play this game and keep your good mood."
5,OLIVIA GRACE LIV,This app is great exercise for your brain!! If you can master these skills they show you it will help you a lot in life. I definitely recommend this app!!
4,The diamond wars,"I would rate it a 5 star, however i prefer the IQ test results to tell you whats best to improve your score. But i like how theres a focus option, because some people (like me) may have ADD/ADHD and may need help focusing! I really like the game."
5,1volt28,"I enjoy everything about this app! If I‚Äôm feeling tired, I do one of the activities to help me get the rest of my work done. I really like the iq part!"
1,William Killian,I enjoyed the app so I purchased the no ads within one game for $4.99. I then started playing another game but noticed there were ads after the first game. It‚Äôs disingenuous to have it cost $4.99 to remove ads for less than 5% off your application. I‚Äôm extremely baffled by this bait and switch without explicitly stating it‚Äôs only for the single game.
5,gdhgdhhfdcjjfxv,It‚Äôs a really good app just wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay as much !!! But really helpful and challenging so if that‚Äôs what you are looking for you should definitely buy !!!
5,lotionman70,Impulse is great you can do almost everything without having to pay a dime. a great way to sharpen your mind.  I would consider even buying a membership!!
5,User 3019620,"Safe and healthy games to not only enjoy, but also make your memory, thinking speed, precision, etc. better!"
3,Kittkat2012,"Has anyone else experienced this? The app does not load  I try closing it and opening it several times, however it just doesn‚Äôt load. Frustrating when I want to play the games."
5,$amaRaaa,"Awesome game , im trying to quit smoking weed and improve my brain chemistry and learning so reduce brain fog!! Highly recommend this before anxiously scrolling through apps , trust me they make it fun for u and increase ur attention span."
5,Chells Wells,I‚Äôm finding this as a nice way to maintain and build my brain skills.  I want to always be able to keep up w/ with my kids in terms of my neuro health.
5,_carmencadena_,I find some games fairly easy - and some quite challenging. But to know that I‚Äôm helping my brain stay in shape is really something!!!
5,‚Ä¶MRS‚Ä¶,They were not wrong when they said they have a variety of brain teasers. Not only is it fun it can be quite challenging at times.
5,Lolo2024!,Wow!  I have been  layed up with a broken ankle and so bored! I never play games. But this one popped up and I totally Love it!!! Kills time and makes me feel so good cuz I haven‚Äôt gotten anything wrong yet! üëç
5,lorna poi,Directions are easy to understand and read.
5,HLHS.MOMüíï,This app is great. Although I have only had it 2 days I actually really enjoy it and could spend hours playing it if I had the time. I
5,Nativerayray,Growing up with parents avoiding the fact that I have adhd I now look for alternative ways to medicine and am so thankful to have come across this app!
5,OGB-,So I was a bit on edge as I didn't know what was actually happening but after my 7 day streak I realized I was actually having a blast with it
5,tripOvr,Out of all the distractions online today this is one app that will actually help with mental health. Your body is a powerful force and your brain powers your body it‚Äôs worth a stretch.
5,MVMike,I enjoy these little brain games in morning to get my brain going. I also am interested in the stats of others in my age group.
5,fullerherd,"Playing this game is, not only fun, but it stimulates and exercises your mind at the same time. It challenges your metal capabilities and if you like competition‚Ä¶it has that too!!"
5,Gizmo7416,I like to keep my brain going by learning new things and refreshing old things as well. This game is awesome and does just what I like to do. Keep my brain sharp.
5,Truck Farmer 1,This app seems to have it all. I‚Äôve only been using it for about a week now and I feel that I‚Äôm improving everyday.
5,Anna Liza G,"Impulse, as I said in the title it‚Äôs very tricky and easy at the same time, it‚Äôs one of those apps that passes the time interestingly and funnily!"
5,pensilvanja,I love this app because for me I just have many problems with math and sorting this but this app helped my brain function faster than usual
5,hmitauer,I like using this app for training and learning how to see objects and not jump to fast trying to solve problems.
5,xorosalena,I don‚Äôt even pay for this and what‚Äôs available for free is amazing. Don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt want to do some fun brain training. I use this everyday.
5,Loopyboxcar,I‚Äôm thankful for the brain training games. They cover all progress and reports to see how ur brain works each test in this app. Deanna
5,Eureka PACU RN,Super fun thing to do in between tasks or when waiting somewhere. Makes me feel smart and  more productive than scrolling on social media.
5,Sukiwg,What a fun way to get my brain thinking quickly again. I love trying to improve my scores. The games are fun and improving skills that I don‚Äôt use everyday.
3,MikeMTX23,"This is a pretty well tool to use and it has its fun bits.  The training lessons focus on individual traits such as, peripheral vision, memory and other things such as math etc.  However instead of ad being after your morning lessons they slap them right in the middle of each on lasting enough time for you to lose all focus. Including the personal $15/Year offer. If you‚Äôre not paying you aren‚Äôt allowed to focus on the lessons without being interrupted in between.  Love the idea of this tool, however."
5,Happy girl Ukrainian,I have just started but I already love it. Because there are many things to train and many levels. Thank you the team who creates whose games üôèüëç
5,Nfran,"Purchased the yearly plan, really happy with the games so far! Enjoying this compared to doom scrolling or watching pointless videos! Thank you to the creators!"
5,Silencer‚Äôs,"I am getting older and my concentration has dropped, I feel more confident now that I have been using this app, it keeps my brain working."
5,happybird13,I mostly downloaded this app to have access to the tests to know my archetype and trauma response style but the daily brain training games are really fun and it‚Äôs cool knowing how you perform on a percentile relative to age related peers.
5,Psilovehoran,Even if you don‚Äôt buy the features it‚Äôs still fun and it really helps. I hope more features become free or that they keep it this free cause it‚Äôs great
5,Reddakk,You get to learn about yourself while playing the games the games are fun and go from easy to harder the app breaks down your score in detail
5,blessmeJesus22,It‚Äôs worth it. Worth you‚Äôre while and good price. If you‚Äôre going to be on your phone to kill some time use it for this! Help your brain. Get this
5,Ajay the Trans Guy,It‚Äôs only day two but so far it‚Äôs help with work stress and being at home. I‚Äôll leave a more better review after a month !
5,Abby_b03,I really love this app. I‚Äôm in my 20s and I enjoy the games. They really challenge me and get my brain juices pumping. It‚Äôs fun and much better and much better than playing candy crush:)
5,lej1227,"Really, I have noticed a sharper thought process since starting ‚Äúplaying‚Äù this app.  Recommend it just to reactivate skills that might be falling off."
1,Andy-rev,"First few days are too easy. Then the game gets WAY too hard and squeezes you with time for a round. There should be some sliders to adjust the difficulty and time cuz the game just becomes more frustrating than challenging. Also, the rating is misleading and not based on real data. SCAM for the money they are asking."
5,Maryen 23,Let‚Äôs you know where you are at in certain categories and let‚Äôs you practice and improve your skills
5,MGBeko,"It‚Äôs a new game. So far enjoyable. It‚Äôll probably get tougher, but that‚Äôs why I signed up for it. Makes you think. I am competitive, hope that won‚Äôt be my downfall."
5,Lela Kurtz,As you stop using certain skills it helps to use these type of puzzles to increase your memory and math skills
1,Linn's Garden Decor,The puzzles are somewhat interesting. Then you get the same stupid ad every couple minutes! Sometimes the app will have ads stuck on and won‚Äôt go off until you uninstall and reinstall! Fake new user installs!!! I‚Äôm going to find similar individual games and uninstall this once more ü§Æ
5,Laurenlee29,"Fun, easy, quick way to feel like your doing something healthy for you mind with out having to do a cross word puzzle everyday."
1,Rpops36,"I canceled the free trial upon downloading the game I do this, so I‚Äôm not stuck in a subscription. If I like it, then I choose to start the plan however, again I canceled the subscription right when I download it and you charged me anyways, you should not be charging clients first of all if you allow a free trial period. Fraudulent ! I wouldn‚Äôt pay close to $30 for an app that‚Äôs insane."
5,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwawa,There is not an app like impulse that helps you to train your brain in almost every way thinkable and unthinkable. I love this app and have recommended it to family.
5,lmduquec,This app is the best choice that I made because sometimes I just want to entertainment but this is the best way to do it and also help me to improved my skills.
5,meeshi51,I‚Äôm only a few days in but I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. I‚Äôve been looking for a app that will push my mind again as I‚Äôm getting older and I love it
5,whatthehellboi,"As someone with ADHD who struggles with remembering math problems and stuff like that this helps me a lot.  I love sorting out colors in different jars, memorizing patterns, and a lot more. This app couldn‚Äôt get any better!!"
4,James L L,"Even after my first time , I could feel the parts of my brain were being worked! The next day was even better! Thanks for this app!"
5,bbh20polo,I‚Äôve been using the app for only a few days and can already feel the difference. It‚Äôs like candy snacks for the brain!! Love it!
5,M&M üåÆ,This game is so fun and you should definitely download it! It has so many different games to play and the premium cost is only 28$ a year! Even without the premium it‚Äôs super fun!!
5,nono hjiko philipenes,"Impulse is such an amazing app that is not only fun, but also mentally stimulating. It has taught me so much about myself. Do wish the weekly was a little cheaper, but I can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt worth it."
5,Simkets,It really makes you focus and gets the mind off everything else. Helps with memory and concentration. Recommended it for my mom too
5,Zachias88,BETTER. I love kill time with a fun game on the toilet or when ever I‚Äôm waiting on other at work. Now i can do the same thing while improving brain function!!!
5,Nagadyzania,Games are fun and enjoyable and give me things to do to pass the time that help me brain activity and keep me away from things that may waste my time.
5,MadtheHatter,I recently downloaded this app and I already look forward to when my daily brain game notification pops up! It feels good to exercise my brain!
5,Mrs. Miranda,I LOVE IMPULSE But‚Ä¶ I have a few corrections .I think that there should be categories for younger children like 15-14 or 13-12 so then there are easy games. Also I would like if you could challenge a specific person not just the age group your in. BUT Don‚Äôt get me wrong impulse has to be one of my favorite apps so let me state what I love. ‚Ä¢very fun games ‚Ä¢sharpens your mind and senses  ‚Ä¢Let‚Äôs you pick what types of games like math or others  ‚Ä¢Game ideas ‚Ä¢AND MORE!
4,Charlie Mo,With all the apps available that only waste time this is a refreshing alternative to pointless time wasting. It it only helps mental capacity just a little it better than not at all.
1,Andrea Bair,I think the positive reviews are fake! One said you can use the app for free and purchase what you need if you want to. Giving the impression that you don‚Äôt have to buy anything. FALSE! Only a 3 day free trial! I will never pay for an app. I searched and did not see anything saying purchase required. Makes me feel like this is a scam! Deleted the app!
5,QuelepaCity,Challenging and fun games. Adds always pop up but that wont keep me from playing
4,shetha1,"It‚Äôs a good way to stay sharp and on your toes, you will not be disappointed it‚Äôs an great game for those who struggle with concentration and memory and it also helps improve cognition. Go head and try it you‚Äôll love it! It does wonders for me"
5,Bdoll1821,I have two days using this app and I love it it actually really helps me get my brain to exercise areas I usually don‚Äôt do as a stay at home mom
5,Izzy Fi,"This is fun and engaging. I just downloaded this yesterday but I‚Äôm enjoying it so far, I‚Äôm only using the free version but if I still like this after a week I might upgrade"
5,Whoismojones54,Brain excellent is the tool anyone can have. Without we can not exceed in anything so keeping strop and up to par is my main focus should be yours as well.
5,Moviemaker27,Fun games that make you feel like you‚Äôre exercising your brain. Not sure about the science or if it really works but it‚Äôs engaging and I look forward to the games.
5,ArtistOfNoise,"It‚Äôs quick and smart. Yes it has adds, but you get a little game fix and you get back to your day. Enjoying it."
5,unoweed,"I haven‚Äôt had to pay for anything yet lol but it makes me feel better about spending time on my phone, i like it so far."
5,JHapplesful,I usually never play iPhone games but I love the idea of improving my focus and brain function at the same time there are variety of games and they are all super fun!
5,pjm0220,Just started using the app and love it so far. Great way to spend some down time instead of playing a game or scrolling social media.
5,ShariJJ,Easier than I expected but gives my brain a much needed workout
1,hdjxnebebdjf,Just wanted something I could spend some spare moments on to increase memory and such. But everything requires the upgrade to premium! Took a test on the app and you have to pay to see the answer. Wasted my time answering 40 questions. Can only play like 5 games a day free basically the rest of the free ones are boring. Would rate a 0 stars if I could
5,shoshees,I‚Äôm not a game person.  I do feel this so different.  Helps me focus on what matters and gives me a quick rest in my day. It‚Äôs like a brain refresh.
5,ya mammi ho,"It keeps your mind busy and when you pass the  games you feel so good, also they have test for w.e you wanna know about yourself ."
5,Bam915,"Definitely helps keep my brain going, plus it‚Äôs helping me stay off of social media during this detox. Great way to spend your spare time."
5,JackiePanfil,It‚Äôs so cool to see where you place on these tests and after every game it tells you where you place amongst others in your age group!! Really cool! Definitely worth it!
5,CharmingCharley,I love this game so much because it helps my brain grow and it‚Äôs a fun thing to do when I‚Äôm bored I definitely recommend this game! I never had any problems
4,011001111010,"I think this app is great to give it a try. It has OK puzzles and mini games for you to play but if you don‚Äôt pay for it, you have a lot of low budget ads. But overall I‚Äôm satisfied with it."
5,Espinjaie,I am able to keep myself busy while also making my brain work and I love it
5,RK63839,"This is the first app I actually wanted to do review for. It‚Äôs really fun and entertaining while actually helping your brain, problem solving, & critical thinking!   Really enjoy it!"
5,notbri3,"This app is great! You‚Äôre able to test your iq, play stimulating brain games, and track your progress along the way. I‚Äôve been having so much fun with it!"
5,t3_the_kid,"Between this and Lumosity, these games will keep your brain sharp and they are actually fun and quick. It‚Äôs the modern day morning ‚Äúcrossword puzzle‚Äù. Get this game, stop reading what I‚Äôm typing lol."
5,pies&shoes,Thought I should brush up on my skills.  It‚Äôs been a minute since I was challenged so thought why not give it a try. So far I don‚Äôt have any issues
5,ArtgirlA√ºra,Honestly the most fun I‚Äôve had playing games in years - gets me right to the edge of my seat & makes me competitive in the most positive way. Very visually pleasing & always leaves me wanting more
5,bonnie71V,I like the variety of games and challenges this app offers! So much fun . I Just got started but can‚Äôt wait to see improvements!
5,LowerBobs18,"It started off pretty easy but now it‚Äôs getting more intense with every level. Definitely a great way to get  my brain sharper, especially at the my age. Need to get back to par with my A game."
5,Paul Garrett3,"I didn‚Äôt know what to think upon finding this app, but I‚Äôve come to enjoy it. Some of the games or tasks seem mundane at times, but it‚Äôs a fun cognitive exercise. I‚Äôd say give it a try!"
1,DallasBoy88,The games are enjoyable but loaded with ads. Eventually you will see the option to pay $4.99 to get rid of ads on the game. This is extremely misleading because most people would assume that it would remove ads throughout the entire app but it actually only removes ads from the specific game you are playing. Pretty scummy tactic of you ask me.
4,pineapple0814,"I love this app I just wish there was a little more variety, and sure you can have more if you pay. :( But for free still quite a bit of games that can keep me busy. Also love the math reviews helps me remember!"
5,Chibi!2,Pretty good too ok kill time and helps you in other things that you need help with through out the day
5,PennyWize ik,Impulse is a really good app it helps improve your IQ and it has test for u and puzzles. It does have a lot of adds but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really effect any thing. I really recommend this app
5,Keyly22,"With barely a day already with using this game, it self explanatory, then again some seem like it‚Äôs challenging but solve it anyways. So definitely GOOD in general!"
5,DYEHFD,"I just started using this a couple days ago, but it definitely works your mind. We will see if it has any long term advantage."
5,caralaalaa,"Totally obsessed! Love this app and the many, many options it has. Love being challenged and they always have something new to try. Very, very pleased with my purchase!"
5,PMacStrong,"Gets me away from social media, while still being able to decompress but use my brain at the same time."
5,Sharon 1985,I am loving the variety of games and how short they are. I can pop in for a mental change of pace and pop out easily.   Thank you!
5,Tonya08021,I‚Äôm still checking out all of the different games but it‚Äôs definitely a break from the day and mentally stimulating
5,BugblockHoot,Just started using this app and i can see where it will help. You have to think quick
5,Wg2017!,"One of the best purchases I have ever made in the App Store. The variety of games and puzzles keeps you entertained for hours, truly. I am addicted in only the first few days!"
4,Bowl-her,Changes my thinking pattern by exercising my mind.  It also relaxes me‚Ä¶. No stress; I do it at my own pace and progress as I move along.   Thank you for making it so much fun and easy to help my memory and thinking skills.
5,Jawaiian Jam,"This game really tests you on being focused, and also tests you on your memory. This will probably help you on preventing you on memory loss and being distracted."
5,HotTammili,I definitely enjoy doing these brain workouts for 10 mins everyday. It definitely helps keep your mind sharp and going.
5,Zhavjlen,I absolutely love this app and enjoy testing all aspects of my brain. My memory can be really bad at times and I don‚Äôt do anything in my personal life to practice and train.
1,Wrecknology ,You can‚Äôt play the game without accepting the trial. I played the trial and decided to Pay for the Lifetime subscription. After paying for the lifetime subscription I was still getting charged for the weekly subscription. Which the app did not override nor give me notification to cancel the weekly subscription.

1,Ehaaff24,"This game can‚Äôt let you play more than one level without an ad, I get needing to pay for the app while it‚Äôs free to download but there is such a large amount of them that it makes it completely not worth playing. Play a level that takes 10 seconds (at least at the start) and get hit with a 15 second ad."

2,BeTrueToMe,There aren‚Äôt enough games to keep you occupied for more than about two weeks. Their updates don‚Äôt give you more games and their challenges are the same games over and over. It becomes seriously boring and useless very quickly.
5,Tnkgurl,"As a person With adhd thesis game is so much fun, the game is interactive and gives you a challenge in fun way. It is great for the brain because it challenges with new games each day."
2,Sara3bey,And ads and ads and try to sell you subscriptions or ad free sessions between more ads with skip buttons that open ads‚Ä¶ this is the only game I can‚Äôt figure out how to exit ads and play the game. After loops in ads to app store to ad to app store it starts another ad! enjoy!

1,Dancing with heart,I clicked the trial button and then proceeded to download but didn‚Äôt realize they would charge the purchase price immediately. Beware they lie about having a trial. I‚Äôm unable to cancel because it shows up as a purchase and I cannot dispute the charge until it is no longer pending. App it ok but not interested in keeping it.
2,I‚Äôm not okay with in app ads,Love the games but at $28 I should never get in-app sales ads that prevent me from playing the games I PAID for. I unloaded the app and want my money back yet NO customer service. I‚Äôll take this to my credit card company. I do NOT recommend bc like I said $28 and you still get ads that interrupt your games. No thank you.

5,Eduard raptunovich,Great app i use it often and have for months. One of the few i go back to regularly
1,Jpinto171,"So this app says it‚Äôs free on the main page. However when you go to use it, it requires you to pay to use it. Technically, they aren‚Äôt lying when they say it‚Äôs free to download. They are being misleading. If the app charges money to use, than they should be upfront about it and not try and manipulate people into downloading it to boost their download numbers."
3,nellllio,Just getting started but the light gray and tiny print is so annoying! And can‚Äôt zoom so have to take a photo of every page.   And a grammatical error the second page in?? C‚Äômon guys. Hard to take you seriously.

5,e411bo,It‚Äôs refreshing to my brain and I‚Äôm actually considering buying a subscription to see how much it will improve my memory. The devs put a lot of effort in the app and it‚Äôs noticeable.

I got charged $7.49 again on Nov 23 despite no longer having a subscription. I thought fine again. I should have done something at this point, which is my mistake, because I got charged $7.49 again on Nov 25, not even a week later!   Beware, folks!"
5,Keys_and_Kicks,"I think that children should play this too, or at least they should have things like this in school to test their knowledge."

1,Bobbie Jo Stracener,Same issues as everyone else. The app giving 3 day free trial and not even  10 mins in already requiring me to pay to get results from a quiz that was free to take. Scam. Reading reviews looked liked the company replied which means maybe they are trying to improve it but then reading they generic and pretty much say same thing over and over
5,Rynosaurus,This game is everything and more I have dreams about impulse brain games it‚Äôs taking over my life and i love every minute of it

5,pyrochem15,I enjoy playing the trial version. I wish there were better price options.
5,dotkaio,"The headline is pretty self-explanatory. Once the brain has constant contact with such exercise, neural plasticity take care of the rest. Highly recommended."
5,LLainey24,I really enjoy Impluse. It has so many brain games that I like playing. I especially like numbers. Even my 7yr old son likes to play some of the games.

3,Sem8480,For some reason the app is not registering the games I played today. I‚Äôve done each twice but it shows I‚Äôve done 0 and wants me to start a 3rd time. I hope this is a temporary glitch or the app will be useless.
1,MightyManX,"The creators of Impulse are greedy people taking advantage of people who are struggling to make a quick buck. They allow you to take ‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù and ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù tests but then hide the results behind a paywall. The games meant to ‚Äútrain‚Äù your brain are also a complete joke, no need to charge $6.99 a week for things that are already free all over the internet."
5,TLBryan,I‚Äôm enjoying this app even tho I‚Äôm finding out how much help I need.  I‚Äôm looking forward to working thru these exercises to work this old brain!

5,vbbbtyypppffqq,"Love the apps all the fun brain games all in one spot, but not willing to pay a monthly subscription or $40 for lifetime too expensive for apps games you can get free else where"
5,all hail tiktok,I have add and this is really helping me right now I‚Äôm. A 9th grader also a beta student so I have to keep my brain strong and steady for the up coming test and this is really helping me!

1,Joytaciousrex,Decided to try the 3-day free trial to see if this is worth paying for. Took one tests and was led to a screen saying I need to upgrade to the yearly plan to access my results.   I don‚Äôt know how they expect someone to be able to determine the value of the paid version if the free trial doesn‚Äôt provide any insight into what information you‚Äôre paying for.
4,CSY0123,I have not been using impulse for far now but I am already impressed on how much you can learn and how much this app offers. I really like the daily quizzes and the tests section of the app.

3,_kristennp,"I wanted to take some tests and enjoyed the ones I did take but can‚Äôt see my results without paying. It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt offer something free, like watching a few ads to be able to view like most apps do."
5,helpless102,I love challenges and being challenged so I am thinking that based on what has come up so far this will fit the bill. We will see.
5,Zk890,I've really been enjoying the training and have noticed improvement in my processing speed.
5,Merkus1978,This is a great way to keep the brain moving. This should be something that would help people that are Alzheimer‚Äôs prone and prevent that from happening to them.

1,dairyyyy queeeen,Advertised to me via a personality test. The app has much more. Tons of games tests etc. If you don‚Äôt pay for a subscription it‚Äôs all pointless. Might be worth it but might as well just make you pay up front rather than wait till after you invest in taking a 100 question test then make you pay for the results. SCUMMY!

2,sdm_cgc_mdc,Recently I noticed that sometimes when I launch the game it just hangs on the logo screen.  The only time I got it to work was when I rebooted my phone.  Even then when it finally finished launching I got an ad even though I have a subscription.

3,Hurricane_Shane,"This developer keeps advertising this app by showing a specific game/puzzle in the ad. But when I download the app, that game is nowhere to be found! The app seems solid, but I am SO annoyed that I downloaded it SPECIFICALLY to play this one game and it‚Äôs NOT‚Ä¶. on there!!!  The game/puzzle is one where you are shown multiple pairs of colored dots and are asked to draw a line connecting each dot with the other one of the same color without crossing the lines.  It looks fun. But it‚Äôs NOT in the app.  I just wanna play the game!!! üò´"

2,baaaarki,"The brain training games were really fun and well done. The gamification of the application has some nice touches that I enjoyed.   Here‚Äôs my problem. When I go to fill out an archetype questionnaire that‚Äôs 72 questions long and I can‚Äôt see my results before hitting a paywall, that is just a shame.   From a UX standpoint it makes me feel like you didn‚Äôt value my time enough to warn me that I would have to sign up before receiving results. At least inform the user to ensure that they understand how they‚Äôre about to spend their time.   I deleted the app."
5,LF Bus & Rec Frequent Traveler,Make sure to understand how game works because you can‚Äôt go back if you hit wrong button

1,Akmomma25,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre willing to pay pay pay! Played it for awhile but everything seemed to push towards having to pay for everything. Took a test but couldn‚Äôt see results without paying. Waste of time. Make it a one time fee for buying the app, these subscription based apps are annoying as heck."
5,REWBQ,I haven‚Äôt committed to anything yet as I am in the 3-day grace period and am excited to see if this app supports my even evolving Artistic Awakening with own Spiritual‚Äôs friend.

5,AmyBCtheOD,Other brain games seem repetitive! This one has so many options and levels to each game!
1,b√ºks,Found this app on a ad. Was immediately spammed with so many questions and pop -ups. Made me sign up before even using.

1,babbabsbsbbabsbbabsb,"It didn't even help me improve my memory it only taught me things I already know and overall is wasn't even fun. The advertisement was nothing like the game which also made me really upset. I wouldn't recommend this because it doesn't improve anything and it is so unworthy that you have to pay to play, for something that is useless."
5,Nicaux,I am a true sucker for marketing schemes but this app is actually fun & challenging enough while being cute enough. A joy for me to look forward to when I‚Äôm going to bed

5,Teddys mammy,So much fun. Love the insight and the games. In order to get breakdowns of IQ and ADHD test etc you have to pay the month or year‚Ä¶ other than that the trial is awesome so far!!
1,OCDVampire,You have to pay weekly.  Don‚Äôt waste your money on this. It‚Äôs very expensive.  When you load the app they ask you your goals etc and before you can play they offer you a short free trial.  If you accept the free trial it will automatically start charging you every week after the trial is over.

5,#TObHonest...,I like to play games from time to time on my phone; and it‚Äôs nice to play games that make me use my brain power and focus!!!
5,Dime 525,"This app is very beneficial to the cognitive brain development, a great way to start and end your day as it stimulates your brain. 10/10 recommend"
3,Testy and bored,"Some of the games have very specific regional understandings needed to be successful. Also, the tests do not up date and are extremely limited. The ones advertised have not been delivered months into usage."
5,Cfzvgghh,"Perfect game.  Love all of them.  Only downside is there is no feedback on whether your scores are improving, just how you score against your peers."
5,Igna Group,It‚Äôs relaxing because you think of nothing more than what‚Äôs happening in front of you and it flexes your brain!
5,emilyrcraft,"I‚Äôve been using Impulse for over a year and their games are fun. I like to play games that help memory, increase focus, and include problem solving. Love it"
5,p.&.c forever,I like these games very much i actually do better than i thought i might
5,batshee,Started this one day ago and I‚Äôm already noticing a difference in the way I think when I‚Äôm out and about.
1,ahannahahannah,"After maintaining a streak of 29 days, my account mysteriously deleted. I took so much pride in my streak because I‚Äôve been working on my consistency and mental growth. I was even looking forward to reaching a 30 days streak. However, that all came to an end. This crushed me and I will no longer use this app. I do not recommend this app."
5,pinksma56,I enjoy the challenge and I felt good about the results. I think it‚Äôs a great way to improve your memory skills
5,KnitWitzStitchery,"The variety of games included in the app was very good, and they‚Äôre both entertaining and challenging.  Highly recommend!"
2,TjP√Ønk,"This app will not let you try it without a subscription. I did the three day trial subscription, and it would not show the results for tests without paying completely for a subscription. I was originally tempted to buy, but won‚Äôt considering the deceptive practice."
5,smokey sings,I a RN and worked with many elderly patients.  Watching them loose their ability to use their brains is hard    This app is a great way to maintain our health
5,Smitty1659,This app is awesome! Has so many different brain challenging games inside! It always keeps you on your toes no matter how often you play!
5,M@ttsgrl16,I decided to try this app to train my brain. I like the tasks and plan on continuing with the app I would recommend to anybody that wants to become sharper.
1,Cyn123456,This game is totally useless clickbait. The games they advertise on social media aren‚Äôt even what you get when you download the app. Plus the games it does have are just constantly interrupted by ridiculously long advertisements for mind numbing games. I can‚Äôt believe this app has the ratings it does. Must be fake.
5,4swanys,"I never have played any games on my phone, but these are great.  And I love that they are helping my cognitive and executive functioning skills to improve."
3,3 stars it‚Äôs ok,Impulse is great for training your brain to do certain activities better but it does take a while and it‚Äôs not as fun as they make it sound you might like it but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like the greatest thing ever                      At least that‚Äôs what I think
5,Hippie_Gypsy_Witch,Take a break from life and enjoy the games that will improve your memory and other skills.
5,AfroJack68,got this app because I wanted to keep my brain from deteriorating from nonsense information we get on the daily.
5,Robbieheybake,"I enjoy the app for what it is. I have the free version, and it gives me daily little tests to get my mind going in the morning. So far, I‚Äôve had fun with it!"
5,Coyboy1224,Great variety of games and the interface is very user friendly which helps you focus on the games.
5,DacodaRose,It seems pretty easy now that I‚Äôm just in the beginning but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to get tougher
5,Kingsosa_3000,"Always looking for ways to grow my intellect, thankfully I came across Impulse and have started my journey toward true mental health."
4,ashesofgrace,"Enjoyable fun and gets you thinking; I have enjoyed all the games I‚Äôve tried. Only drawback is ads if you use the free version, but that‚Äôs expected for games."
5,Kaleesi10,"I try to walk 7 to 10,000 steps a day for my body and impulse is what I do on the daily for my brain. It‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs a great workout for the brain."
5,Vane Hernandez,I enjoy Impulse because it keeps me busy and focused. Sometimes I go to sleep later because I don‚Äôt want to stop playing
5,khelwig,I had a large tumor removed in 2019. I deal with a great deal of new brain deficits/damage and severe memory loss and this has been a great training game to help strengthen the areas that are weak!!
1,WDPERK,"Don‚Äôt buy anything if you think the tests will tell you new stuff you can‚Äôt find online. If you want the brain games, seems to be plenty of that there for you‚Ä¶ but the advertising makes it seems like you‚Äôre gonna get an easy-to-read test result to help understand your ADHD type and personality, but the reality is lackluster."
5,w0olfie,"Just a little something quick to do, when you need to take a second."
5,Mo3Diggity,I can really see the improvement in my remembrance of all the tests that I‚Äôve done that I haven‚Äôt seen in years. I can only imagine what‚Äôs next!! Keep up the good work!!!
5,tygamerforce,It takes practice don‚Äôt do everything at once just go in bite sized your skills will improve solid
5,Makuch2,I‚Äôve had it for one day and I can already see how beneficial this will be after daily use! The games are fun and the streak helps incentivize daily practice!
3,mckeownjess,"Fun games and quizzes, but the free version is over the top annoying with ads. The games are very quick and after every two games is an ad, and they are longer than the games!"
5,Elloquito,"I have been using the application for a few days, usually in the morning and it wakes me up just like a cup of coffee!!!"
1,kiwiyamagushi,"I did the trial to test the archetype test, and after answering 72 questions they ask to pay for the app, if you decline, they ask to pay for the results üòÇ   I didn‚Äôt bother to even check out the other games and just deleted it. It‚Äôs a money grubbin‚Äô app, they should be upfront with what they will charge so you don‚Äôt waste your time. I hate these dark UX patterns."
5,Very great and calming app,This might be one of the most calming apps I have ever used. It‚Äôs calming and is has helped with helping muscle memory
5,@technicallybry,"So far I‚Äôm really enjoying this app, and I can say after a few days I‚Äôm enjoying clearer focus. I also taught myself a new mental math trick at 34 years old, which is really cool!"
5,Kip Roughrider,"Love it so far, great way to wake up my mind in the morning,  even before coffee. Time will tell if it really works, but even if it doesn‚Äôt it is a lot of fun"
5,Super fun@$@)(,"I am 36 and love playing phone games. That being said, I wanted something that would also challenge me. This app fits the bill!"
5,SKCOLUMBUS,Helps me clear my mind from the day‚Äôs stress and makes me feel more on top of things in terms of my brain functioning/thinking clearly!
5,Rhondooo,Just started this and I love it already give it a try you won‚Äôt regret ! My Brain feels better already..; thank you!
5,Aalexy,I liked this app ‚Ä¶ i had the app downloaded but never really paid attention until now and i like it
5,BPD CF,"I‚Äôve only had this for a couple days, but it‚Äôs been fun and WAY better than death-scrolling social media!"
5,Andrewhooded,Have a lot of fun and also feel like it let me decompress after a long day at work
5,Zugeex,Impulse gives a brief explanation for the skills practiced prior to each activity and  at-a-glance review of performance after. The activities are stimulating and progress in difficulty at a reasonable rate.
5,‚ú®GwOrL‚ú®,"It‚Äôs literally every brain sharpening game ever existed! Also on my first day you could choose from 3 boxes and I got a 92% discount for premium! And it‚Äôs fun, relaxing, and perfect for younger kids"
5,Mem#85,Great streamlined games that challenge the brain. App is also so easy to use and I like the pop up reminders
5,werrtgvxxaswawNOW jfcffjcgjcg,"At first, I did not know how to read, but it taught me how to read and how to do my multiplication better and my division and everything else I need help in"
5,MamaBearBF3,"So much better than mindlessly scrolling social media. I‚Äôve only been using the app for one day, but it‚Äôs amazing how much it has reduced my anxiety. And I love that I‚Äôm sharpening my mind."
5,Woowendy,Still trying to figure out what all my results actually mean but entertaining and challenging.
5,Danimal1978,"Fun quick games to help relax and unwind. I‚Äôd almost say it‚Äôs mindless fun, but you do have to think. it focuses you on small quick tasks that also help w/ memory skills"
5,Bob2229,You are wonderful. The only way you could be better is if you did not charge!?!
4,GoopyGoop66,The games are fun and I enjoy challenging myself to do better each time. Only complaint is that it seems a little expensive for something as simple as a phone game.
5,cc2388,"I‚Äôd love more levels of candy sort and a response to my inquiry to developer about an issue with one of the levels. But still, best game app out there!"
4,Fire Avocado,I downloaded this for the adhd type test but all I saw is the general do you have adhd test. The games are nice and it could be fun and useful but I really wanted to take that test
5,sandman5209,"I love the game there‚Äôs so much to do like tests, games, quizzes and etc the free game of the day is one of my favorite parts of the game and if you are trying to challenge your brain this is the perfect game"
5,Masseymomma3,I‚Äôve done two days worth but it is pretty cool so far. It keeps wanting me to subscribe to a yearly subscription. So far I can close out of it.
5,Ironbullets2003,You‚Äôll forget all about you problem while trying to solving these fun and intense questions. Your brain will thank youüòÄ
5,a person i guess?,It helped me focus a lot and if you need help like remembering or focusing or anything else Impulse is the right app for you and to train your brain! Thank you for reading and shoutout to Impulse!
5,BelieveIt88,Really nice when you have idol time or just need to take your brain for a walk lol from normal everyday routine and strengthen skills while doing something!
1,Jekehdgejdnhzuf,Don‚Äôt buy this cause I tried buying it and the first thing they did was try and get money outta me frl and it was all good until all I wanted to do was relieve my stress and do this quiz and now I can‚Äôt even see my results because I got to pay for a subscription or buy the results like what? They over here just tryna get money outta people frl so don‚Äôt buy this.
5,KalunIsTwo,"I‚Äôve personally been using this game as a brain warm-up daily, just to wake my brain up, and refocus. It works so well for training my brain to be mindful and more aware."
5,eetspeedilyootendooten,"As we age, we need to make sure our brains stay active. I love games, and these are designed to make your brain stay flexible."
5,BanduGuy,I love impulse! It‚Äôs the best anxiety reliever app! I love it because it helps your brain develop new skills and it unlocks SO MANY skills you didn‚Äôt know you could have! Just get the app! It‚Äôs amazing.
4,NYC Kasia,"It‚Äôs a good app to exercise your brain for a few minutes a day. It helps you set goals, choose what you want to work on and how much time you want to spend playing games each day."
5,dark eyes raven,If you feel like you aren‚Äôt as quick with as before you should try this games to keep you on the ball
5,barbalba,I like being able to challenge myself mentally every day. I think it keeps me young and sharp and I enjoy the challenge.
5,Anne Marie C,So far I am not frustrated.  It will come before I know it.  But that‚Äôs just me.  It is fun though.  I wish I had started this a while ago!  PS I am 62 in a few weeks.
5,nova1234554321,"This game is amazing. They help you relax, test your brain skills, and get a sharp brain. For the time I have had this game I have enjoyed all of it and I suggest that you download this game.üòÅ"
5,Bonagirl69,"I really enjoy this app, because I really like the variety of games and they really do test your memory while making it fun!"
5,ZegbanK,Great app Day 2 and already seeing improvement in my problem solving and cognitive abilities. Very helpful app Thank you to those who created this God Bless you guys
5,Jonesmsr,I‚Äôm excited about a game that makes you utilize some critical thinking and works the ol‚Äô noodle out for a change!
5,hoopermusic,I‚Äôve had it a couple of days. Went ahead and paid for the discounted yearly rate. Fun little challenges.
5,Tyrannicus Rex,"Addictive, need I say more?! Plus it brings out your competitive side to see your performance against others"
5,Yeroc's girl,I like the variety of challenges offered as well as the opportunity to level up when you completes round error free.
5,cupcakesobrien,Love all the games on this app. And at least I know they are helping memory and function rather than mindlessly staring at my phone!
5,fufhdhfh,I think that this app is a very nice app you can read your IQ you can test your brain and there‚Äôs lots of fun and educational games that I love there is also a lot of fun puzzles
5,Lazyriverfridays,"This game is awesome for keeping your Brain Sharp! The only downside is that you have to pay a subscription, but it‚Äôs totally affordable and you can cancel anytime."
5,Gurtis Lemay,Really would recommend if you feel like your brain is melting away. This game makes your mind sharp and adjusts to what you want for your goals üëç
5,DaviPBD,"I highly recommend this app to keep your critical thinking, processing, and memory skills sharp. It is very fun and the science of neuroplasticity and BDNF growth is proven to help. Highly recommend"
4,ANABSOLUTEFOOL,"Try more visually appealing techniques so it supports visual processing speed, which you‚Äôre supposed to work on obviously I know but the layout is a bit difficult to decipher sometimes"
5,Abigail.l.watson,"I enjoy this app because it occupies my brain, I‚Äôm a huge over-thinker so it helps me focus on one thing for longer than two seconds."
4,cvipe,I like the game Impulse because I am a competitive and I like to compete against myself to better my mental math.  The game is also well organized and easy to understand.  Material is presented in a non traditional way that encourages concentration and focus.
1,QUEENTQS,Says the IQ test are free but they aren‚Äôt You have to pay more money and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù but it charges you right then and then and then says that your previous amount that you were charged will be refunded in several business days. Really bad for business seriously just a money grab and should be definitely used for entertainment purposely only. It‚Äôs a waste
4,Chel1990,"I really enjoy playing this game, but there are a lot of ads. I get sick of waiting and end up clicking out of the game. Other than that, I really recommend and enjoy this app."
5,treewood817,This app is wonderful and so much fun I shared it with my team at work it is great for helping u problem solve and view things from different angles which is great for life
5,joker_alexander,When I have a very unproductive day I use this and it makes my brain up and going again!!!!! Highly recommend this game.
1,professor dep,"I purchased ‚Äúno-ads‚Äù for $4.99 while playing a game. Apparently the fine print says that it only removes ads for the specific brain game I was currently playing, not for the app. So the moment you switch brain games, ads are back. This is misleading and crazy expensive when compared to the cost of ad removal in other game apps."
5,2560164,I use impulse everyday and everyday I get better at the games. This app recommends games based on what you want to improve. I definitely recommend this app!
5,spatrob,"Good game to keep your mind sharp. Helps you focus and it‚Äôs not a time consuming game!  I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days, but so far I love it!"
5,Vik in NOLA,"I like doing the puzzles daily, and trying to beat my own high scores. Never gets old, and I feel like I‚Äôm actually challenged! Love this app ü•∞"
5,RoqueITFDB,You have to try this game it‚Äôs so much fun & the games it has you play keeps your brain going & I love the fact that my brain gets to work lots.
5,survivor 5673,"For someone who‚Äôs been suffered from short term memory since 2012 , I‚Äôve found something that‚Äôs not only helping me with my memory but also wit confidence & moralüôèüèª"
5,Rickbob,"Aside from the daily games, I‚Äôve noticed that taking a time out to play a game or 2 in the middle of work has helped in refocusing."
5,Subes31,I really enjoy taking a few minutes to play this. It‚Äôs calming and I feel sharp rather than mindless as I do when playing other games.
5,Rus+The+Nail,"I like this app because it causes me to think,and to actually use my own brain,and not a smart phone, so, I thank you for the breath of fresh use, lol"
5,Oshujala,In my 18 years of using mobile phones I have never liked the idea of gaming on them but this app will s much more than a game app. It‚Äôs a brain app
1,KHOfficial,"This game is a swizz - a freaking con which preys on the vulnerability of those just looking for something fun to do once in a while. It is nothing like it is advertised, doesn‚Äôt tell you that it‚Äôs going to be priced until you have downloaded it. To be honest there are FAR better and more superior apps that help support mental health functions than this‚Ä¶ just saying."
5,lettuce100,I‚Äôm being charged for this game and I don‚Äôt even play it! There is no way on the settings screen to delete payment information!! What type of app does that
1,Peachs 'n Cream,"Yeah so when setting up the app it requires a paid subscription and gave me no way to navigate past it to even see what the app or games were like.  Their response to people keeps being that you can get past that and then have a version with ads, but mine wouldn‚Äôt even let me do that.   It just wanted me to pay."
1,Jrad b,DO NOT! Download this app. I downloaded this in September and when I realized it costed money I immediately deleted it. Well without me knowing they automatically make an account for you and charge you for every couple weeks(even after cancelling and deleting the app).  I look back now and they have charged me over $105 for an app I haven‚Äôt had downloaded on my phone since September.  These guys are scumbags DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
5,justke11y,"I really enjoy the app. Especially because it explains what each game helps with (decision making, memory, etc.) Thank you!"
5,TheCrystalWitch1231,This is a great app for anyone who wants work on basically any brain function. The games are fun and quick and I like how it‚Äôs tailored to you.
5,cd5052,"So far I like this, haven‚Äôt decided to purchase but may do so after a few more sessions"
5,paisa2018,I can‚Äôt think of something to help may be share how smart you are with friends and invite friend like on call of duty
5,austend,The first thing you should do is to check your email and log in.
5,TheOldMe4,"I‚Äôve actually surprised myself with my skills!! I LOVE the games, and the information provided on your particular test results. I‚Äôm looking forward to mastering it all!"
5,SoftTony,This is an easy way to train your brain as well as being fun.  This is simple game that helps keep my brain and reactions sharp.
1,StealthGear,"I started a free trial and within the first 10min of use, I decided to purchase a longer subscription but it charged me for the 7-day trial anyway. The charge I accepted was only for the other subscription and was surprised to see a higher amount on my bank account. I never approved the 7-day charge. Would be nice to get my money back."
5,jacquz,I recommend this to anybody who is having trouble with their memory. This helps to focus and think.
5,Summertime AJ,This game is the best. It has every brain games I could never think of. And when lesson is done I play nice games that help my brain. I so recommend this game it is awesome.
5,Jojo567hake,So far so good. There‚Äôs deff pop up for subscriptions but easy to bypass and utilize with plenty of free challenges and games. Easy to use easy interface great app.
5,Amanda Wait,I look forward to seeing how I rank to others and it‚Äôs interesting to see the ones I do well with!
5,Njmerritt,"As an older person, I am happy to have a place where I can exercise my brain. Great puzzles and challenging as well."
5,Judy 3x,I can pick it up anytime and spend as much or as little time as I want. I hope to get better as time goes on.
4,Punkrocklitty,There is no place to update your age. So being in a certain age group is permanent? I also purchased this for a lifetime I won‚Äôt be the same age for a lifetime. So far that the thing I see that I don‚Äôt like.
5,Aimee from DE,"Impulse is a very fun way to spent your time online. Instead of mindless scrolling, I feel like I‚Äôm doing something positive for my brain!"
5,ESprog,"Not only do you get to learn more about your personality, test/strengthen your IQ, but you also get to unwind with fun games that keep your brain sharp."
5,Shesews,"I live in fear that I will get Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. My mother had it and it was awful! I want to do what I can to prevent it. These puzzles are fun and helping my memory to improve, you gotta love that! üòÅ"
5,Jayden is cool to /:,"I was told by the app to give this a 5 star review, but tbh it‚Äôs not bad. I feel like it‚Äôs 10 brain puzzling games all in one game. 5 stars is a little much, but I‚Äôd say 4.4/5"
5,NatL6,I have ADHD and it takes quite a bit to keep me entertained and focused. This seems to do the trick when I feel like I am hyper focused on unnecessary noise or tasks.
5,Shanman7,I love the games because they are really short. I can play 3 games in a few minutes and move on. Great app. Worth the premium for sure!!
5,Gnat2417,I originally got this app to play the games. Every test I‚Äôve taken so far is accurate and describes me quite well. I recommend.
5,fineasscardplayer,"I‚Äôve only just started but it‚Äôs keeping me interested. The dopamine hits I‚Äôm getting from playing, makes this app super satisfying and effective!"
5,Mens Agitat Molem,I like the intuitive interface and seeing my stats. I‚Äôm only on day 2 but enjoying it so far.
4,Mope0,Really enjoy this app but I wish I could back to easier difficulties to practice on certain games other than that this app is awesome
5,Rey David Del Mundo,I really like impulse because it‚Äôs making my head return to normal and I like staying sharp.  Thank you impulse.
5,atrigaldo,"There are a variety of games that are interesting, fun and stimulating. If you like to challenge yourself and push the mental envelope this game is for you!"
5,Riosstoria2013,"Impulse is the best game ever! It is fun and entertaining. I only had it for a week and boy, it is amazing!! I don‚Äôt even need to download any other  games because it is so cool plus it is cheap."
5,youtube3suck,I have bought the app two days and I like it. The games are well designed and could make me focus‚Äôs.
5,mrvintage1945,"These games do get a lot harder at the higher levels but I guess that‚Äôs good, right? DEFINITELY gives your brain a good workout at the mental gym. Really enjoy them."
5,Hinachan23,"I love the layout on this app and the games are pretty baller in setup. Added bonus, the daily workouts aren‚Äôt mentally exhausting üòå nice bite size pieces so you can keep going afterwards."
5,JulieKyna,"Easy and quick instructions. Games itself are fast, too. I like it a lot, so far."
2,NatAlt Foco,I‚Äôll admit I have little patience when it comes to ads but I tried the free version to make sure this was going to be worth the purchase‚Ä¶There are so many ads that I closed out. I got three pop ups before I could even make a selection to start and then ANOTHER ad.
5,slimqt1,The games have been fun and chalk and jus what you see on the ad! I play the free version so the ad are long but m considering purchasing.
5,debi jbk,This is a fun app and I‚Äôm learning as I train my mind to react to stimuli.  What‚Äôs better for this old lady than to get more intelligence and be Whitt and wise!  Enjoy the fun when you join in.
5,SheMama09,Impulse is the BEST app that I‚Äôve purchased. Ever! From the personalized training sessions to the different game you can play to strengthen your brain in between training sessions. LOVE IT!!
4,phlly_chs_stk,"I love the small games and I feel more confident in my mental abilities after using this app, and I just do 10 minutes a day in the morning before work"
5,KimJones1973,I‚Äôm doing the free trial right now but so far it‚Äôs great. Exercising your brain in the form of quick little games that make you think.  Great app!
1,H suze,I signed up for a free trial - the app clearly stated no payment today - and was immediately charged $43. I requested a refund through apple but it left a bad taste in my mouth so I won‚Äôt be using the app after all.  Edit: developer response didn‚Äôt seem to actually read my review. The app offered a free trial and it wasn‚Äôt given. I already know how to cancel a subscription.
5,PY--- miss Open Table,"Impulse is fantastic. I have become quicker, deeper thinking, and more comprehensive than when I started. Impulse is far more than I had hoped. Got to keep going!"
5,Thereareliterallynonames,"This app has so many fun options. It‚Äôs like every brain app I was looking for is in one app! It is fun and educational, and a perfect app for everyone"
5,RAAW SOUNDZ,I work this app everyday just to build and keep my brain strong. It‚Äôs like my daily brain workout without weights!
5,tabbydrew72,When I sit down to do my daily work my kids even get excited and watch me and we all get a brain exercise in. Absolutely love it!
5,Kate9618!,"Loving Impulse completely!!! Only had it for a few days, however can‚Äôt wait for what comes next with this app!!!"
5,yea2710,"I do these brain games for about 10 mins each morning, its the best way to wake up and their fun!"
5,MFlo928,I‚Äôm 40 and this is a great way to keep my brain sharp. I enjoy all of the exercises. Everyone should do this a few minutes everyday.
5,Raymondgirl97,I have tried other brain games and this one by far is the best! I like the games and the app is easy to use!
3,Lilau13,The app is good but definitely some questionable/offensive/inappropriate ads. I think some other folks have brought this up. Really should get that under control or users need a way to report them.
4,kira diaz,"This app is okay and it does actually work, I‚Äôm having fun playing the games and I‚Äôm learning at the same time"
5,Journey Dawn,It‚Äôs a great learning experience for me . It‚Äôs helps my ADHD alot . I‚Äôm able to focus more on what I‚Äôm doing rather than focusing anything else or everything lol.
4,Max_36048,I like Impulse but it has its flaws. Every time I get out of a game an ad pops up for me to buy something and it comes up right on top of the play button so I almost spent $30 bc I wanted to play a game.
4,GoatedMarino,"It‚Äôs entertaining and definitely helps with cognitive skills and coordination, a great way to spend spare time as opposed to playing video games and things of that nature, I definitely would recommend"
3,JYDEtroit,Great games. Super graphics. But it needs updating. Did you just write this then never again put effort into it? Please add more candy sorting. Once I maxed out I couldn‚Äôt reset it. Once you‚Äôve done it for a few weeks it gets boring.
3,cool coaca,"It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôll make this short but not too many ads, interesting things to do. Big downside: YOU HAVE TO BUY SO MANY THINGS TO GET FULL ACCESS. To find the results of a quiz, you have to buy. And every time you open the app IT ADVERTISES BUYING UNLIMITED ACCESS. Not something for people who don‚Äôt want to pay money."
5,#1PradaDog,"I love the games and how it increases in difficulty. Although I am unable to purchase the game, I definitely feel it would be beneficial."
5,mikoGamer:),"Not only is this app the best brain training app ever, but I got a coupon so I have to now pay $30 yearly!!üòä there are brain games too! Thank you so much Impulse!!‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,im a giraffe rawr,I tried this app out thinking it would be fun and it is for the most part until you get to the results for any test you have to pay to see your results which is ridiculous I mean what‚Äôs the point of taking the quiz if you can‚Äôt see your results I mean really it‚Äôs disappointing
5,Twinklestarisbright,"This is so easy to use and at anytime you want to use it. Helps improve cognitive thinking, quickness and accuracy. Get it.  You won‚Äôt regret it."
5,Grapejuicerickey,There are an excessive amount of ads if you don‚Äôt pay but if you can ignore that it‚Äôs a lot of fun and keeps your mind working
5,lolhiidkwhatsup,turns your mind off and makes your brain workout at the same time. Best of both worlds
5,inushi,This is the best game ever I say this because I have tried many of them and this one has worked so well I feel so calm. Hope this helps :)
5,LilBigPine,"So far so good wish I didn‚Äôt buy the lifetime package that‚Äôs what happens when your drinking I guess, challenging and fun makes me think I‚Äôm getting smarter"
3,Monkey_D._Luffy,"It‚Äôs good to exercise your brain but this game is kinda limited. If you want more features, you have to pay. Don‚Äôt waste your money. There are more free games with unlimited features. Save your money and manage your budget wisely"
4,Mangomuncher1,I think the impulse is a really good app. You can play a bunch of games and it‚Äôs really fun. The only downside I think it has is that it has a lot of ads but other than the ads I think it‚Äôs really cool
1,yngboyjake,"Absolutely useless, all it does is give you vague pseudoscience and spam you with notifications to get you to hop on it and watch more ads. Definitely a pointless app but people who feel they don‚Äôt know themselves enough and need others to do their thinking and labeling for them will fall for it. Would not recommend"
5,BugPartyTime,I got it because I got the huge sale and I‚Äôm not disappointed. I love the peer comparisons it makes me want to keep going!
5,bobboboboobobobobovf,This app makes me feel less guilty for enjoying some screen time in stolen moments during my busy day. I am doing something positive for my brain and it is relaxing and fun. PERFECT!
5,Monerolord,The apps is user friendly and very interactive. Daily exercises help you keep your brain sharp while you wait in line or lie in bed. Great app overall!
5,Sheweeeee,"Frustrating but that can be the nature of a good challenge. Haven‚Äôt invested in it as of yet, but so far (it‚Äôs only my second day) I am enjoying the app"
5,Rue ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"My days can be pretty boring, but doing these little brain games makes me feel like I‚Äôm actually doing something üòÇ"
5,Proud Tsa La Gi Mom,"I‚Äôve enjoyed leveling up on this app, I feel like the short daily tests are giving me a boost. Plan to keep up with daily checks."
5,CaseyLeeLane,This course works with you and is a very reasonable way to get your brain back on a learning tract. The program builds confidence well.
5,rpm1956,I Really enjoy the games and I surprised myself by how much Work I need in my reaction and memory I look forward to working on my mind
4,TMILLLOVESMUCH,Enjoying this app so far - I was never one for multiplication or division as a kid and recall spending lots of time in the hallway crying during Algebra.   So an app like this helps me brush up on some skills I never quite mastered as a kid. üòÄ
5,tobybrint,This game definitely keeps your mind sharp and health. I would like to thank the team of developers for dropping such great product!
5,GroovyKndoflove,Thank you sometimes you just need a little push in the right direction to remember what you are capable of.
5,notmyricksha,Impulse is addictive in a good way. It helps you retain memory in the most fun way. I found myself kept on going back to it on my subway rides.

5,Nightingale68,I downloaded this application to keep my brain healthy. Both of my parents have been diagnosed with dementia. I am really enjoying the experience.

4,bickivkl,After having my left hippocampus removed (where our memory mostly is) this has really helped!
5,AriesTaur,It is a subscription and so I decided with the black Friday pricing to try it. There are many games daily to help with memory.

4,Sucky dashboard...111,"The messages for the large # of updates drives me nuts. I haven‚Äôt noticed any improvements or added levels in any updates. Also, pricey if you want to upgrade."
5,JBev34,"fun, and keeps my brain in check!, just wish it was a free app, because im maxed out on a budget and can‚Äôt even afford to add this in after my trial ends :/"
5,Kolene223,Starts out slower and builds. I feel that this app has helped my concentration improve and I‚Äôm able to recall information more easily!
5,Mae Jean,I like this app because you learn a lot about how to speed up and keep mental math in your head. But you should not need Wi-Fi to use it.
5,JenZenQ,Something to keep your brain working if you have a few minutes to burn on a train or in line.
5,Janagg2010,"It‚Äôs really fun, it test my brain and they are also other puzzles to do after you do your daily workout. Is so fun I can‚Äôt stop playing it!"
5,ashlizrow,I‚Äôm really enjoying this game so far! I‚Äôve only had it for a few days but it is entertaining and helping to keep my mind keen! Highly recommend!
5,Deananarama,"I have been battling long Covid. I don‚Äôt know if it is helping in a clinical sense, but I feel like it is. Impulse seems to be helping me concentrate in little snippets of time."
5,Scrubs1989,I hope the deets on here is accurate because I wasn‚Äôt never sure of myself. ‚ù§Ô∏è

5,Bolowei,"I have only had it for a few days, but the app handles your dally tasks while there is still a lot you can do if you want. Pretty cool."
5,Kay Baldwin,"It really exercises your mind but is a relaxing and calming game, it is excellent for training the eye and being quick to have the brain really moving to reach the next set goal."
5,jaymel44,This has been a very helpful app for me. I‚Äôm looking forward to experiencing some of the other things that the app offers.
5,Meechem22,I have been looking for a game to test me and no other game has so many things to test you on all fields of academics and puzzles and memory
5,Tacolover664,Started playing brain games to keep my mind sharp. The games in this app are fun and challenging and I can definitely see how playing them will help me long term.
5,Crystald18,I enjoy the games on Impulse. I can see how beneficial the skills are in the games. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to strengthen personal skills in a fun way!
5,GrifdaKing,But it is very rewarding I feel like this could help a lot of people that have issues focusing on tasks. Overall excellence describes this app
5,owner of original idea,I understand you want us to purchase but let users use it more before
5,Yooo ‚úåÔ∏è,I definitely needed to brush on skills after not being in school for a bit and this definitely helped!

5,ArianaFujino,This game is awesome I have trouble staying focus and this game is helping me a lot it has a lot of other different things as well try it you are going to love it
4,biggreendad,"Initially, you wouldn‚Äôt think that you would not only enjoy the types of exercises but also the effort you make trying to achieve the next game."
1,talktotisha,"I get that the goal is to make money - but the ridiculously loud apps after every single level just made me hate the game - I grew increasingly annoyed after each ad that I deleted the app, versus purchasing.  There‚Äôs a way to entice players to buy your app - dumping 20 seconds ads after every 30 seconds of play is not it. at. all."
5,BibiKim2,I start my day off with Impulse. I love the challenging activities and believe they are helping to exercise some of fine motor and cognitive skills.
1,12345678abracadabra,"I just got it and was able to play one game after watching 2-3 commercials. It froze after that snd it was no way to open it. I am taking it off my phone but I was wondering if there is a payment after the two days, although I did not go far enough to agree to it. Please let me know how I can check for subscription or not. Thanks"
1,MODERNxESK1M0,"I downloaded this app hoping to train my brain and while looking at the subscriptions I accidentally clicked on one, somehow when I pressed cancel it purchased it so now I have a premium subscription I don‚Äôt even want, I go to the website i see them saying where to cancel it but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. All I want is to cancel my subscription I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on this at all!!!"
1,MacTeve,"I seriously can‚Äôt believe you would charge $6.99 a week for something like this. You are ripping off your customers. On top of that, you all have a very entitled attitude when responding to customers reviews to your app. No wonder you are charging so much up front, rip off your customers for as much as you can now because you know you won‚Äôt last as a business."
5,Blessed Humble,The impulse app is very helpful. very good. The games actually making me smarter and making my brain so much sharper in every area. I absolutely love it and is greatful for this app.
5,RubyRoo702,"It‚Äôs very fun, easy to understand and it gives you insight on why you think and do the things you do in a very unobtrusive way. Love it!"
5,Shamee44,Thhese are great challenges and I am certainly enjoying them. Thank you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖI haven‚Äôt played recently but I‚Äôm back now and love the brain  challenge!! Come join us!!!
5,KymberlieMarcelle,Severe memory issues running my family. Just trying to keep my brain going.

5,dajbjj,I really enjoy this app.  I was never a game person on my phone.  Great games that are fun and educational and keep you learning and sharp !
5,KLuv85,This app has already helped me maintain and grow my mental capacity in a fun way.  I am a Director of Engineers and the games help me stay sharper at work and in my personal life
5,Sam013196,Helps me ease my anxiety and instead of scrolling on other social media platforms I can go to Impulse and actually make my brain happy!!!
4,breezer by the bay,Still being introduced to Impulse. This maybe the app I‚Äôve been looking for.   Working the brain muscle and getting feedback on my efforts.  I like it.  As an older adult with ADHD I could get ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on the mental workout.
5,Vanni0894,It has great memories games. Simply but if you want to distract yourself for a couple os minutes I think you will like it.
5,myboykavanaugh,"After cranial brain surgery, I found this app to stay on top of my cognitive development & functions and it has been helpful for my mental health and mental wellbeing."
4,jteaches,I just got started and I am already noticing a positive difference in my mental abilities. I only rated it 4 stars because I believe there is always room to grow. It would be nice if there was a musical option.
5,Jeg780,Several different games. They do not take long
5,JAGAIMX,"It‚Äôs really fun actually. I‚Äôve been enjoying it so far, definitely recommend trying out the free trial first. Everyone enjoys different games, ticks or whatnot."
4,1986kittycat,I would give it five stars but the personality tests (trauma for example) with the images are not available even after buying the app.  It was a simple questioner. The games are enjoyable.
1,Pobbusu,Can‚Äôt read the full archetype report after answering all 72 questions without paying even if you‚Äôre using the free trial. They don‚Äôt tell you this until you answer the whole thing too. The Dev response makes no sense because if you won‚Äôt show the results you shouldn‚Äôt allow a free trial user to tow the test in the first place
5,Cowgirl@7,These work out games are so fun that you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre exercising your brain. Highly recommend.
5,Alexis Amendola,I like it a lot. Passes time without knowing it. Takes my mind off of everything and is fun too. I like this a lot.
1,Natal_000,The free trial has limitations that can only be removed if you pay the yearly fee! This app also claims to give you a free 3 day trial. The app doesn‚Äôt honor their own cancellation policy and will charge you despite cancelling within the recommended timeframe. This app is not worth the headache of having to dispute the charge with your bank. Pick another reliable app that honors their own policies.
3,Iluvstormies,"I understand the need to make money to pay for the development of this product, but the free trial is not really free. You have to pay to get the results of tests. that false advertising just makes me distrust and dislike the product. Practice transparency."
5,AA3120,Really good way to help my short circuits. After a demanding day at work my brain is exhausted and my executive functioning is nonexistent. Helps get me balanced so my brain is less frenetic at bedtime
5,Lizzy Riley,"I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been having brain lapses throughout the day. Forgetting names, zoning out, lack of concentration. This app really helps keep me focused and sharp."
5,probablykate,"I enjoy all the puzzles and quizzes available. It makes learning about your brain, and solving puzzles seem like a game."
3,Bumblebees45,"I love brain games, but too many ads! No one wants to watch a 30s ad after every single 20 second game‚Ä¶. This is a problem across the board these days and I‚Äôve deleted a lot of games after 1 play."
5,lizbecca,It‚Äôs better to do this than most other things I waste time doing on my phone; it‚Äôs set up really well too.
5,ND farm girl2,Enjoy using these quick games to keep my mind working.  Is nice tool for relaxing and taking mind off other things.
5,DRG1,I‚Äôve just started and love the quick brain challenges that I‚Äôm asked to complete. I hope to keep my brain sharp!!
5,Wendy0000000000,"10/10 would recommend, If you don‚Äôt have this app on your phone you‚Äôre not in the cool kids club."
5,caro feild,It‚Äôs a game that push your brain to be fast but fun at the same time. Give you the tools that you can apply in the real world! Love it
5,MMNORTH,I enjoy the fact that there are many different games to choose from.
5,MegEGEdwards,I just started using this app and I‚Äôm already in love! It provides a great break for when I‚Äôm stressed and makes me feel like I‚Äôm exercising my brain :)
5,Dee Wayde,"Really love this app. It has multiple games, all in one app, which really gets your cognitive thinking in high gear. Would recommend 100%."
5,RGSOTELO,"I love these games, they really test your abilities. I have very bad memory thanks to Fibromyalgia and Lupus and I been searching for a game that forces me to use my memory and skill. I SURE FOUND IT WITH THIS!!!"
5,D7489,"This app has help me use my brain more than I normally do, reminding me of knowledge I seemed to have taken advantage of and forgotten. I really enjoy the app it is a very good eye opener"
5,Cytdiva,"Hey I really am enjoying this app. I have been struggling from a TBI, with short term memory issues. Impulse has helped a lot, besides being good entertainment during my recovery."
1,CareerWoman101,"I could not see my basic results for the ADHD test. You can sign up for a 3 day trial, but you don‚Äôt get any of your test results without paying and the app asks you to pay at every new screen. Deleted immediately. I might‚Äôve paid for a subscription if I got the chance to see any of the process besides answering the quiz questions."
5,KJCC111,"It is easy to dive into the brain exercises, even if you only have 5-10 mins to ‚Äúplay‚Äù."
5,ChanceFit,"I haven‚Äôt played long enough to reap the benefits, but it‚Äôs fun and the money is well worth my memory and smooth brain function."
5,RylieLK,It really is helping me with my brain development as an adult. Totally totally worth it. I have ADHD so this is so much better than medication . Fixing it naturally with games like this and clean plant base diet.
5,fkruggoobnxjgdifkiyg,"Two days in and i already love it. Theres a great selection of puzzles & games, as well as data & statistics to keep you informed & encouraged"
3,dgherastovschi,Every app is the same. You can‚Äôt really get anything out of it but to watch ads to move further and you constantly get a pop asking you to subscribe.
5,rcor0562,"I enjoy the games and my memory is improving everyday, I‚Äôve been using the app for a week and it works"
5,M&M Ashley,Even the free version has games that truly provide a brain workout!
5,Swagger28,This app has really helped me retain information especially since I started back going to school. The games are unquiet and challenging
4,TupTuprocks,"This is quite a fun brain training tool as someone who has a cognitive disability. I enjoy doing this sort of sorting and memory work, it‚Äôs been too long since therapy. I personally enjoy this app!"
2,Scuba.Steveo,Every screen movement activates an ad of some kind. Want to turn off ads for $1-3 like most other apps? Nope. It‚Äôs $7 per week! Too greedy. No way this app is worth that price. This is a $5 app for the content it currently has. I‚Äôm deleting. It‚Äôs unusable with the amount of ads pushed.
5,voidjacked,I find this to be an entertaining way to sharpen the mind and see where you‚Äôre at with your own brain
5,Stimulated Acres,I find this entertaining to pass by the time and at the same time improving the ways my mind and brain work!
1,bethua,I‚Äôve enjoyed every part of this app up until I went through all the levels for several of the different games. I‚Äôm replaying the same stuff and am super disappointed because I‚Äôve been waiting for a long time. Y‚Äôall said it would be updated last year and nothing has happened.
5,Powhoodoshow,I loving playing impulse to improve my memory and problem solving skills! It‚Äôs also helped me get my mind off of things on stressful days!
5,Sircy11,I enjoy the games to pass time with but I have actually noticed an improvement in memory.
1,wagnerke11,"The free trial is 3 days, not long enough to even form a habit of doing the program, and all the diagnostic tests are available, but YOUR results are hidden behind a paywall. Super unhelpful, super sneaky waiting until the last screen after 72 questions to try 3 times to charge me for the year to learn about my own ADHD. Will never use again."
5,Buff Brain Billy,I absolutely dig this app! Every day at work I play on my lunch break. Definitely notice the improvement in memory and problem solving.
5,Nate_Carroll,It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm firing on all cylinders. This app has taken a spot in my daily routine to help me stay sharp and I thoroughly enjoy the trainings and tests!
5,linda with a dog,"These games are very different from those of other apps. I can see how these games will help my brain to stay sharp‚Äîthey are not mindless, repeated the actions."
2,Soulbre,"I would love this app so much if it had any sort of free-ness to it. I only get to use it for four days and then nothing is free and I think that‚Äôs silly. If the app isn‚Äôt actually free then you should think about putting a price on it in the App Store, so broke people like me don‚Äôt get their hopes up."
5,Epicriss,"Slow and not too challenging at first, but I can see that, with time, the challenge will be there."
3,eheusk,Give me a break. You‚Äôre app isn‚Äôt telling people anything new. If you‚Äôre quicker and smarter then most then voil√† it‚Äôll tell you that. In percentages it‚Äôll tell ya if ya got it or ya don‚Äôt for 6.99 a week or month?! Get out of here and it should say right away not free
1,Te Menon,"This app makes it impossible for you to cancel if you sign up for the free trial. I have sent them multiple emails, comments and messages on social media to ask them to cancel and they still have not.  The games are so-so, so if you are on the fence do not subscribe to the free trial as you might have to pay for something that you can get elsewhere for fee"
5,061889Emj,Cool concept. Fun interesting tasks to complete. Though it‚Äôs a cool app I think improvement on the score like what is your actual score and what the comparison means
5,JuNeneK,You don‚Äôt realize just how solving simple problems can keep your brain sharp. I use it often.
5,Avocadolvr,"I love this app. Even more I love the candy sort game. This is kind of silly but I wish there were sounds when I click on the balls. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èotherwise, I love it! Great app!"
5,Softpoet1776,"The games help to lift the brain fog that I didn‚Äôt know I had. They tickle my brain and are now part of my morning wake-up routine. Bible and time with Christ first, then Impulse brain trainingüå∏"
5,gentle unicorn ü¶Ñ,I recommend this app to everyone because of how great it teaches people how much they need to teach their brain and practice and to keep learning.
5,Lazerwolf07,Straight forward and very enjoyable. I plan to play often over the next several months.

5,downlod it now!,Great experience with the apps bf the interface. Highly recommend but definitely be ready to pay
1,terrible-app-good-job,"When signing up for a free trial you are told the trial is for a period of 3 days. In their subscription policy, they state ‚Äú Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period.‚Äù Thereby your ‚Äú3 day trial‚Äù is really a two day trial. Don‚Äôt let these guys screw you over!"
5,hdld skabdjsnvd,Its helped with my stress and strengthened my memory. I would definitely recommend it to everyone even if they don‚Äôt experience stress and anxiety.
5,HalfJasonHalfKarren,I love these little cognitive improving games they are actually addictive for me! Helps me pass the time and keeps those basic skills up!
5,Scoobdolvr,I hate video games I liked candy crush but I annoyed me after awhile as it was constantly the same. This game is fun yet enhancing of motor skills!
4,mC2016Eddie,This game is nice to use while unwinding from the day. It helps with Lessing my over thinking from the day‚Äôs adventure. Second day of using the app looking forward to what may happen.
5,GI@ssy,This is my favorite brain game that I have though I don‚Äôt think we should have ads ever time we are doing our daily game/s.
5,Hei Hei 1234,It gives you great ways to wake up your brain and helps to improve your reflexes

4,10mm gurl,"It is a fun and interactive game that has just enough challenge to keep you coming back but, not too hard to make you never open the app again!!"
5,KitJohn17,My kids love the games as much as I do. It‚Äôs fun to let them play it and share excitement over brain games instead of mindless crap games.
2,Justin.S2,"Great concept - ads aren‚Äôt intrusive, games are engaging and can be tricky. I would pay for the premium version if the app worked. Crashes continually got worse to the point where I can‚Äôt even open the app past the loading screen."
5,papagino,I downloaded this a while back and only recently started. I‚Äôm having fun and plan to continue the free version!
5,cashcow9999,This app is a great start to everyday! Enjoy waking up in the morning and taking 5 minutes to wake-up my brain! Strongly suggest this app to everyone.

1,cokerdrpepper,"This app features an experience that upon first use guides the user to enter demographic info and then buy a subscription. If you cancel out of the payment, then you are presented what I would consider to be a convoluted UX/UI that goads you into buying access to their games. The free games are garbage and merely exist to serve you ads using the info that you‚Äôve provided them."
5,kristin 8D,I‚Äôm in need of strengthening my brain in various areas after sustaining a concussion- this is easy enough to navigate and seems fun so far‚Ä¶ enjoying it!

You need three things in your daily life to stay happy.  Mental stimulation/accomplishment  Physical stimulation/accomplishment Social stimulation/accomplishment   This app very clearly checks off my mental stimulation and makes me feel accomplished in that aspect

1,Sierra6758,Really weird app. Why offer a free trial if everything is gated by starting a subscription immediately anyway? I would have been willing to try it out if it actually let me see the benefits of it during the trial. I spent 25 minutes on a test only to find it gated when I was on the free trial. So weird.
5,hasjhqshas,Quick game to pass a few minutes

1,SynNGrin,"Do not download.  I paid for a year and here is my experience. Games you see in ads do not exist in the app, even with paid membership. After 6 months of use, one update deleted all my progress. It even asked for age again. Nothing was left. No test history, daily exercises.. nothing."

5,Lil‚ÄôSiS‚Äô,"Impulse is a wonderful way for me to relax and let my brain have some much needed fun! I would enjoy knowing my scores, but it‚Äôs fun to me either way!"
3,Fiery Red Sunrise,"I signed up for the free trial. However, I cannot see any of my results. It keeps telling me to choose a plan to view the results. Basically that means I can‚Äôt view anything until the trial ends and I‚Äôm billed $6.99. That‚Äôs not how a free trial works and is pretty deceptive."

1,Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus.,Unless u plan on subscribing to the app u won‚Äôt get much out of it. I saw an ad talking about find out ur personality type or whatever. Sure I‚Äôll check it out. Download it sit there completing the test. Then the magic moment of it tallying up my score for the grand reveal‚Ä¶ all for it to tell me to subscribe to find out what it is. No.
5,[SNARKCORN],I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with the different games they offer. Unsure of the effects yet but I will update my review when I find out!
5,Ion333333333333,"Unlike the other brain training games, impusle has few ads and has actually helped me"
2,BrownieLocks29,"I mean I understand having ads in free versions of apps, but this is extreme with an ad after almost every few second activity. It makes me not want to pay for it just bc it‚Äôs such a sneaky way to get people to pay. üòè"
5,BuckElwood,I only have the free version so the adds are not fun at all but when I do get to play the games they are very fun and challenging.
5,8thstRED,"""I absolutely love the Impulse brain training app! It's been such a great help, and the fun factor is a definite bonus. Highly recommended for anyone looking to boost cognitive skills in an enjoyable way!"""
5,astrozack,'I found using this app helps my mind relax from stress. I feel more relaxed from the bustle of a work day.'
5,&tater,I just started using and am surprise how well the drills are designed. I especially like the daily prompts to remind me to do my mental exercise.
4,lucky gander,"I‚Äôve played similar apps like elevate brain training and I feel like this one holds up and is well made. I like that it explains benefits of games, but it‚Äôs too early for me to know if they are really helping me."
5,mommyshark0622,"The games fun, and even addictive! I love seeing my progress and I love that they‚Äôre all in on app with no ads!"
5,JustMikeyü´°,"Impulse is a great way of relaxing and strengthening your mind, it has helped me have better memory and reaction time.   Great app!"
5,Birdyzie201,I used to play a couple of different word and problem solving games. This is all of them in one. It‚Äôs fun and healthy addition.
5,fun word wizard,I love this app.  The different things I can do to get my brain thinking is amazing .  I look forward to the next day to get my new assignments.  It‚Äôs the best!!
5,Bf***,Great game for brain stimulation and performance. I am so glad I didn‚Äôt just try the game and rather committed to enhancing my brain performance. This app is worth it!! It will not disappoint!üôåüèº
5,BunNan65,I like the varied activities and different skill levels as well as the encouragement!! üëèüëçüíú
3,Zozmael,My free trial was supposed to be for three days but it‚Äôs already having me pay for a yearly sub when I can‚Äôt pay until next year. Yikes. Also I don‚Äôt see the image tests that attracted me to this app from the Facebook ad.
5,Iscam02,I take a few minutes each day to start my brain and it keeps me focused at work.
5,Insomniamania,"After suffering from an injury that is causing memory issues and slowed cognitive activity, this game is helping me to slowly improve my abilities."
5,CyanViper8603,Really good lessons and definitely well made. Would definitely recommend. Will keep using.
4,elenafabiani,I couldn‚Äôt understand one game and it messed up my score but I‚Äôm sure it will reset it and I finally will have the score I deserve‚Ä¶not competitive at all üò¨ü´®üò¨
4,Mills808,"The brain training games are fun and addicting, having to pay for a subscription for full access is the only downer."
5,DaniJoOhNo!,Love this app!! It‚Äôs fun and engaging!! Doesn‚Äôt feel like learning!! Anyone 7-100+ can play!! I also like the wide variety of games!!
5,Qadfgtreuythgedghhhgffvbbn,This app really makes you work your brain in many different ways. It‚Äôs never to late to train your brain.
1,fluer7,The games themselves are mostly okay but only download this app if you‚Äôre willing to be constantly hounded by ads. You can‚Äôt go more than two turn on something without 1-2 mins of ads and on top of that the ads constantly launch you into a new screen you have to exit. NOT worth it.
2,kawboy250,"The puzzles are fun and challenging, but it comes at a cost. Constant ads between games and now pop up ads taking me to the web browser in the middle of a game ruining strategy and planning. Deleing the game never to return. I get they need to make money but now they lost an ad viewer by pushing it too much."
5,Madeline Mc,I use this app almost every day. I downloaded it to improve my short term memory and attention span.  Check it out!
5,Cubano1977,This is a great app and not only keeps you engaged but gives you a feel of pride and confidence.
5,Nathan_236,This game really helped me on a bad day.  Relieved my anxiety and gave me something to do/focus on instead scrolling mindlessly through social media.
5,Carol981,Love it!!! I love all the interactive games and how it helps me focus and exercise my brain as well as helps me relax and unwind in a smart way! Will def continue using it!
5,BeStill&Believe,I‚Äôm not usually one to waste time but it‚Äôs interesting how it works to keep my mind healthy and give me something positive to do with my time
5,Barbiev0mit,I really never care to write reviews but this app is bomb. Do you hear me BOMB babes okay. It helps me so much and keeps training my brain and I really love it so far I‚Äôm 15 and I just enjoy it.  Ok bye :)
1,SerratedGrin,I only downloaded it to take the ADHD test that keeps popping up on Instagram to find out that I have to pay $5 or subscribe to find out the results. I uninstalled immediately after that. I would have given the app a chance or possibly subscribed if it wasn‚Äôt set up to waste your time in such a sleazy manner.
5,RoeActive,"Instead of mindless scrolling, I spend some time to de-stress by doing some cognitive challenge exercises. Stress can lead to short attention span; this app exercise my memory and mental agility."
5,zalmostout,This is one of the most useful apps I have. Very modern training. It gives lesson that‚Äôs at your own pace. I love it!
5,Nelibabyy,Thought It was going to be boring ‚Ä¶ does have ads but not so many and easy to manage . Brain gets stimulated playing this game
5,ùñòùñçùñéùñóùñëùñêùñì,Really interesting games with challenges that allow you exercise your brain everyday. Really recommend it!
5,Emily Herod,I love that the games and puzzles start out easy and gradually get more difficult. I do wish it was cheaper though.
5,Jski215,So many games to choose from makes it a great one stop shop for short and sweet games to keep your brain sharp.
5,Ikiwiki007,"I love this app as it helps to train your cognitive skills and it‚Äôs also very relaxing.  I have noticed I am more centered, focused, and calm after engaging with the app."
1,Girly82,I downloaded this because it was #6 in the App Store. It had me do a free trial but the weekly was 6.99 a week which I thought was a lot of money. So I exit out and was able to do a game and than was offered a special deal for the year. I still wasn‚Äôt sure since I‚Äôm new. I decided to read reviews. Lots of critical so I deleted the app.
5,ArthurThaAuthor,I begin just 2 days ago and I already purchased the annual plan! Looking forward to a stronger and faster brain!
5,Nbchjj,Thanks to impulse I am starting to get my brain back from a tumor removal that was pressing down on my central lobe causing memory loss. Thank you. So much!
5,StartLite1980,This is one of the best brain games I have ever played. I recommend this game to anyone. I am in my 40‚Äôs and let me let you all in on a secret. You need to exercise your brain like you exercise your body. Also need to eat better foods that help with your brain healing. Here are some brain foods that I recommend.  Fatty fish. Coffee.  Blueberries. ...  Turmeric. ...  Broccoli. ...  Pumpkin seeds. ...  Dark chocolate. ...  Nuts.
1,IL1322,Very displeased in this app. It‚Äôs free to download but once you open it it tells you you either need a subscription or to do the free trial. You can‚Äôt do basically anything unless you pay for it which is ridiculous. Charge for the app or tell it straight forward. Very misleading. 10/10 would NOT recommend.
5,ldycakz,I have fun with this brain game and its the best one I have tried so far it has definitely helped my memory and improve focus.
5,XoTerraoX,I love seeing the results of games and trying to improve every time!
5,erp#1,"I am so happy with this app because it is different, challenging and guilt free!!! I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time playing games and it‚Äôs not repetitive! The price is reasonable!!!"
5,toni197111,It is challenging and difficult but I feel that it makes you use all of your brain.
5,DavidYork,Ok to do in small steps but takes time
5,EmilyTBowman,This was the the first game I played on my phone this morning. I got it last night. I enjoyed playing it for the first time!
5,Galaxy205jk98,I honestly like this app it makes you work your brain and as you go the exercises become more challenging?1.
5,Alvgonzalez,You gotta focus and be in the moment to not miss anything. It‚Äôs helping with my self diagnosed ‚Äúadhd‚Äù and being mindful/staying in the moment.
5,RCBABYy,I've been feeling less of myself and more stressed lately. I found myself enjoying the games while focusing on skill-building!
5,daddy oss,This game is actually good but they just need to make the game a little bit harder still fun tbh is a good game to help you
5,beebaaadee,"Keeping the brain nimble and attention focused is the best thing for it. Keep it up, kids!"
5,0817Cookie,I‚Äôve been out of school for some time and it actually kind of fun to challenge myself
5,MellyGrrr,"I enjoy these daily challenges, worth the expense no ads and keeping up with your peers.  Having fun"
5,susan610,"I love Impulse.  All the different games as well as personality tests are fun, informative and help keep my brain alert and active (esp during chemo treatment!).  Highly highly recommended!!"
5,Bmriekeee,I love it because it takes my attention off of everything else.
5,DrStefani,Such a great and easy to use app! Better than surfing social media. A nice app to go to in breaks in a day and know that it‚Äôs helping your brain health
5,Daninibanana,"i have only had it for two days, it is very fun and also calming i‚Äôm more than likely going to keep my streak going!"
4,NAKEDKARMA,I love it because it‚Äôs a fun but fast and a tiny bit hard to and it helps me with school a little bit more and I made my brain work more and stronger and especially smarter to.
5,EmilyS05,"Really does help improve speed , reaction time , problem solving etc  More productive then scrolling through social media"
5,Lorivitro,I‚Äôm 60+ so interested in keeping my brain functioning at optimum levels. These are fun tasks that keep my mind alert and provide a break in the day. Fun and enjoyable!
5,VibeWitMo,Sense I‚Äôve started playing it‚Äôs been nothing but joy. Everyday I can feel and see my progress this app is truly amazing.
5,honeymustardfan23,"This is mind soothing and mind strengthening, there are great options for people if they aren‚Äôt looking for a membership quite yet. i recommend this to anyone."
5,Mind567,Only using the app for two weeks and it does challenge my mind.
5,cftkgdrhj,"Im 14 and i absolutely love being on my phone. Im usually scrolling on TikTok or playing a game. So when TikTok showed me a brain training game i fell inlove with the idea. Ever since, this is now my favorite game."
5,kikithebrat,"This app is so fun! I tried it for the first time and it increased my smartness, memory, and never gets boring! It comes out with new games and supply that‚Äôs helps your stress and anxiety üòç"
3,elc.923,I specifically got this app because the very first ad page advertises an ADHD type test. That‚Äôs the only reason i downloaded it. Then I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere on the app!! Explain? Feels very much like false advertising to me.
5,ximenaslays40000,I don‚Äôt like to leave reviews but this app is so fun and helpful to me. I really appreciate it to the ones who helped make this game. It‚Äôs super fun to play to. I do recommend it.
3,Esilix,"The app is overall good, but not exactly what I thought. But it said free trial?‚Ä¶ so I signed up, and canceled my subscription shortly after because‚Ä¶ well, it did not do much. And it charged me $30?! I thought it was free! At least the games were fun, so woohoo?"
4,stivk star,"Honestly it‚Äôs good for younger kids, it can help them with puzzles, math, and some memory games. But it‚Äôs pretty simple I‚Äôd recommend it more for kids around 4-8 but it‚Äôs really whatever you decide."
5,CDR2879,I think impulse is a fun way to train your brain. It makes you think outside the box on the bonus questions. I really enjoy this game.
5,Karthikeyan Gunasekaran,I have tried many apps to refresh my memory and this is the best app. Fun and easy to engage. I am enjoying it a lot.
5,For my new figure123456789,"I really like this so far, it‚Äôs challenging to an extent however fun. It serves as a nice break in the day to not focus on the day and rather what‚Äôs right in front of you. 5/5"
1,Anon150964890,"There is literally an ad right after every game, sometimes every other game. I know they do this to make money, but I feel as if it‚Äôs being shoved down my throat to make me pay for the ad free version. I can understand the occasional ad, but it‚Äôs just too much and I‚Äôd rather delete the app than pay to have no ads."
5,nananananananana batban,I can tell how it has my brain working. Somethings reduce my anxiety by having me use my brain in certain ways that I didn‚Äôt know I needed.
5,Kaylynn Rader,All the games so fair made me had to think about what I was doing and some made me look dum but they are so funnn!!
5,RedEveTillDawn,I‚Äôm still not turning my notifications on. I don‚Äôt want to feel obligated to do it I want to do it when I want. But I like it
5,Netflix original series,It‚Äôs going good so far but I don‚Äôt wanna pay for it bc it‚Äôs fine with out all the ( good ) stuff but overall it‚Äôs fine.
4,Wilsonbd1,I only score 4/5 because I‚Äôve completed all levels of the puzzles and games and now it‚Äôs just replaying games I‚Äôve finished or maxed out
5,C.tsunvmi,I‚Äôm just doing the free version right now. But I‚Äôm definitely considering buying the full version
5,ajm91484,I really enjoy the mini games that you can play and it does help to stimulate your mind and makes you think.
5,liddypooh,Definitely a good app to play for a challenge and to wind down. Not many glitches. Transitions are smooth when playing.
5,VidaVibes,Lots of fun brain games that keep me entertained for hours! Also love how it shows me how my score compares to others who have already played.
4,liquidmorbidus,"I really hate when apps will ask for $$ right away, before testing.  And then they want a review 30 seconds into testing it."
5,rentalmade,I already feel better about myself and my brain is getting a reset!!
4,han22**,It has been good to use this because it helps confirm different ways I knew I struggled in or thought I did. I‚Äôm using this then too help strengthen different parts of my brain!
5,9181har,I love this app! Especially since I often find myself perusing social media with no end in sight! This gives my brain a tug and keeps me engaged!
5,ShawShank Mike,This is a positive alternative to ‚Äúzombie scrolling‚Äù when I have a couple minutes of down time
5,Losing this customer,I enjoy working my through the levels as fast as possible.
5,Castilj89,This app replaced the mindless games I used to play whenever I was bored. Now I get to play games that workout my brain.
5,Lt71786,I like taking a few minutes out of my day to challenge my focus and memory!
5,The best bae,"It actually makes me think, I thought it was gonna be stupid and like meant for kids but it works for adults too."
5,deinboo,This game is so fun it helps you with memory and learning and you don‚Äôt even know that you‚Äôre doing it because it‚Äôs so fun and interesting
5,NikkiNicolex3,I love impulse it helps me calm my nerves and helps keeps my mind clear I like how it has different games that yu have too use ur brain great game I don‚Äôt have any downers about it
5,kREAMup,"thanxxYouu , i enjOy the detailed information as to how and why the ""games"" focus their help to improve which parts of memory function :)"
5,Ricky Ray Taylor,I‚Äôm up at 3a everyday for whatever reason - and these exercises keep me from feeling that I‚Äôm ‚Äúprogressing‚Äù and not wasting time.
5,UniversalSkoob,I had an impulse to download Impulse and that impulse was on point‚Ä¶ Impulse is great if you want to keep your mind sharp. I played a basic math game and noticed how much I needed this app in my life‚Ä¶ Good stuff
5,fugihioytoeiorogoh,"I like this game, only reason why I gave it a four instead of a 5 is because of the amount of ads."
4,Jerome1234421,Got this as a deal for the full life time payment and it‚Äôs not bad although i‚Äôm a bit skeptical of the crossover this will actually have in my life but we will see!!
5,anisnIssjshhshhhvxxcgv.,This all is great! I‚Äôve only been using it for a week or so but I‚Äôve really seen a difference and improvement in my memory.
5,Gigi Buhrow,"As I have gotten older, I feel more scattered in my thinking. This game helps me with focus and following through."
1,Piglady1992,I tried to take the IQ test with 60 questions. For every 4 questions there is an ad‚Ä¶.& some do not have the option to ‚ÄúX‚Äù out even after it‚Äôs done.  There are far too many to actually maintain a focus & accomplish anything. I deleted after only 1 time trying to take a test. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle & frustration.
4,trailrunner2011,"Love the challenges and goals that keep me working toward things. Price is reasonable for value. It‚Äôs frustrating that on the brain teaser games, the pictures are so tiny that I sometimes miss details important to solving the problems."
5,Dobebiz,Your activities are really helping me a lot! Thank you so very much for you program!
1,900 rated guy,In the first 2 minutes of downloading the app they asked me 3 times to pay for a subscription. The cheaper option is $6.99 PER WEEK.  I took a different test during my free trial and they would not give me the results unless is paid for a subscription.   Misleading advertising. Deleted it right away.
5,orquidea8,"I love the app keep the graphics of your improvement, the games are very fun and it helps me unwind after a long day of work."
5,Wichhart98,Honestly probably one of the best along with Lumosity and Balance. It‚Äôs free but definitely need to put your money into cause there is a lot to see and learn.
5,Amazing grace of F1,Good tests. I learned a lot and improved on many things as well. Hopefully I‚Äôll get way better soon.
5,forget lt,I‚Äôm 81 I fell about a year and a half ago and have had difficulty with memory lots of metal things and this helps. Thanks.
5,Nena0569,"Love the different games, really makes you think, & keeps you on your toes!"
5,brodkyy,I really like how it tells me how much of my peers I can beat and it's also very fun and I didn't think it would be (I got the add for this on tiktok)
5,Monkey king88,Helps with keeping ur brain healthy and functioning properly when you‚Äôre in doubt about yourself
2,Can't signup acorns,"They‚Äôll collect your data and responses, but won‚Äôt share the results with you unless you agree to pay them. It‚Äôs practically data for ransom. Two stars. Not interested in keeping this."
5,AVas_X,"I‚Äôm only my second day using it, but I absolutely love it!! So much variation and creative thought went into designing the different games. Amazing"
5,chris2018XC,"The different levels and games get me more entertained to keep playing, sometimes has me on my toes."
3,nugget man 321,It‚Äôs so good and helpful but I wish I could see test results without having to pay money. Being honest I think they could do really well without all the purchases and adds
5,HM2673BVW,I love this app! It absolutely helps you keep your brain sharp and is a lot better than mindless scrolling!
5,Anonymously720,It‚Äôs actually a very fun little break to get your mind back on track.
5,Aurora potter,I think think this all is really good it‚Äôs been helping my memory and helping me with a lot of other things to!
5,liteOhope,I love this app. I have ADHD and it frustrates me most of the time. I decided to use Impulse to help me focus and concentrate and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I feel more confident in ability to focus!!!
5,Jjhjfbgyt,Good app to help wake your brain up and get moving. Download today and get your brain 1% better everyday!
5,tstudies,Only day 2 and I‚Äôm liking this app! I love how it explains exactly what we are working on for cognition. Looking forward to keeping this app after the free trial!
5,nicoleihhs,"Great interface, breaks down easy concepts and makes lasting impact fun. Would definitely recommend."
5,roxlive,"The best of game style fun,  without the annoying stops to watch another game I don‚Äôt care about - and best of all, the time spent is good for my mind!"
5,barbquilla,"it's a simple and easy way to keep my brain active and healthy, it helps with focusing, memory, attention, agility and more!!!"
5,awesome vero,"I really like it so far, it‚Äôs only my second day but we‚Äôll see as time goes by I will update later."
5,Eli-Dale,I really like this app because I feel it has improved my memory speed and concentration. All of the games are fun. This is why my title is ‚Äúsweet‚Äù.
5,DRKKNIGHT83,Excellent app instead of scrolling on social media this app gets your brain thinking and working! Very good range of tasks and games.
1,Paulettelee,This is my within 24 hour notice- I want to cancel  Read through terms of how to cancel hyperlinks do not work.  Going through App Store to cancel as the terms suggest is also not an option.  Instead of being scammy how about a cancellation button within the app?  Now there‚Äôs a concept üò°
5,wild cats lacrosse 44322,It helps me so much that I now have a goal I do it everyday and that is making me feel stronger thank you so much
5,My nameüòÑ,This game is amazing I don‚Äôt have much to say but it‚Äôs helped a lot. I can focus better and remember stuff more! Hope yall enjoy this game too
4,2023kerry,App started including a game from somewhere else that I didn‚Äôt recognize (had a cartoon King). And then froze when I tried to close it. So I deleted Impulse app and started over.
5,Bear's Belle,I‚Äôve found that it is helping get more focused. I do it in the morning to help stimulate my brain before the day begins.
5,Amnd593,Impulse is a fun and educating app that can help you with some problems you might have and it has tests such as an iq test or personality test like i said it is fun and helpful
5,MDJüòä,I am having fun while keeping my mind busy have many interesting games to choose from.
1,avictorymaker,"Every couple of seconds, I felt like the app was asking, ‚Äúupgrade?‚Äù And ‚Äùupgrade?‚Äù. I considered it until I took the adhd test and it said in order to get the results I had to upgrade. It was clear to me at that point, it‚Äôs only about the money. For a minute I thought I found and app that could help point me in the right direction in life. Nope"
5,Angelshock,"I had a great round in the free trial, but I know the next levels will get successively harder. Looking forward to giving the old noggin a workout."
4,Iceolated1,"I enjoy the tests this app comes with! However, I am unhappy that it promotes certain tests on social media that isn‚Äôt in the app when you look for them. That is very disappointing."
1,S4x1,"For any of the various tests or profiles contained in this app, there are many free alternatives one quick search away.  The ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt unlock results until you pay - bait and switch.  In fairness, there are a number of profiles in a single app with a good design here - but with a little effort, you can find other resources without privacy concerns or an expensive subscription to unlock results- and with transparency re: validated sources.  Ultimately, I can‚Äôt think of a good reason why anyone would give this app publisher access to their personal data, correlated with personality profiles‚Ä¶.  Yikes."
5,jesjcvrilcfbjlu,Very extensive training that involves many different areas. I love that it also offer tests that measure a variety of aspects.
5,reversole23,Using this app to break the habit of doom scrolling in the mornings. Puts my head in the right space every time.
5,Hopethiswashelpful,So far it‚Äôs been a good addition to help keep my brain sharp. Enjoying learning more and trying new things.
5,Jenni-toocrazy,Love the activities on this app it gives me something to focus instead of mindless stroll on other social media platforms
5,JordandaOP,I downloaded this app yesterday and I‚Äôm already starting to learn a lot about myself that I didn‚Äôt know before! üëçüëç
5,Daisymae665,I enjoy spending time here bc I am at least ‚Ä¶ do something good for my brain‚Ä¶ instead of endless scrolling in other apps
5,Amneet1912,Loved the games so far. Worth paying for this one.
1,Donald12306,"I would rate this great, but upon winning a prize for 92% off i wondered as to why it was still 30 dollars, when it said my total was .52 cents. well i try again and it tells me that it‚Äôs .52 cents per week which adds to 30 per year. which means i didn‚Äôt get any discount what so ever which is false advertising. so count y‚Äôall‚Äôs days."
5,ray22233trill,"great app , i love how adds dont just pop up, and i can play non stop mini games that test my brain power."
3,ARMYWIFE 86C3D2,The lifetime purchase option disappeared after I selected to try the trial version. I‚Äôd rather own something I can play for life than pay monthly. Was disappointed as the app is fun and has some great games to unwind.
5,crystalkrzy,When I feel overwhelmed or highly stressed I will play this and it does seem to help my mood and I get back to my normal rhythm
5,Shadowmonarchdead,Impulse is amazing it helps me remember things when I need to do it. It also helps me with stress so when I‚Äôm mad I can go to this app and play it.
1,smilefacenerd,"I cancelled this app before it was set to renew and charge me for a subscription. It charged me anyway. The company won‚Äôt offer to refund me. But it gets worse, I don‚Äôt even have access to the app that they charged me $80 for. I tried to click ‚Äúrestore purchases‚Äù and nothing‚Ä¶I got swindled cold heartedly. This company should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Chi3.29,"Love this app! Sharpens my clarity and thought processes, making the daily work stress load much easier to handle."
3,Bzmie3,"The exercises and tests are helpful, however, many of these tests that I see on various social media ads, as well as on the App Store page are no where to be found in my app. Yes, I have updated the app. I have the paid PRO version."
2,Dcgal23,"There are some games that are interesting/fun, but be aware that there are adverts for Archetype tests that do not exist in the app.  For example, I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúfemale archetype‚Äù test advertised in several places (Facebook/instagram, etc) but the test is not on the app.  I‚Äôve noted similar comments from other users elsewhere."
5,blove817,"I like this game because it brings up stuff that I have learned a long time ago that I should know now. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm retraining, my brain and I love it!!"
5,Genesis_Fides,Too new to really rate it.  Developers should wait for a while before asking for feedback
5,Joyful525,"I love a challenge and although it starts out easy, the increasing difficulty makes me just want to play more."
5,Party-bee,Honestly so much fun and so many game options. It‚Äôs like cool math for adults. It makes me feel less bad about being on my phone for it.
5,_Meeeeeeeeeee_,Love playin these brain games. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm truly exercising parts of my brain I don‚Äôt always get to use. 5 stars for sure !
5,chbellchell,I‚Äôve played this for about 2 years straight. It‚Äôs how I unwind from a long day. It‚Äôs as challenging as you‚Äôd like. You won‚Äôt regret it!
4,gleaning2day,"I decided I need some brain games to sharpen my skills. This seems to be appropriate for what I need. Some things are more challenging than others, especially when I‚Äôm tired! Lol"
1,Meaningful Miles,"The quizzes where super bad. They just kept repeating the same questions reworded, I could learn more about myself with a buzzfeed quiz. They kept having these pop up ads to pay a subscription. And only told me I could get my results after I did the quiz. Don‚Äôt waste your time it‚Äôs a scam"

1,nickysl westfeather,Great app but I updated it and lost my streak so I don‚Äôt like this unless they give me a restore streak button. And everyone who complained just got the same customer support thing if you have problems talk to this email address and we might be able to help why don‚Äôt they just help right away instead of wasting everyone‚Äôs time.
5,Hawkins 1234,Helps you focus and concentrate. Also it helps you learn how to work through your anxiety when you are trying to solve problems.
1,Jrol12334567,Constant ads. I did a 60 question IQ test and at the end of it they ask for money instead of giving my results. Don‚Äôt let me have a free download of your software if you‚Äôre just going to inundate me with ads and constantly ask me for money. Just make me pay for the app to get it. annoying. Deleting. Bye.

1,12484924,This is not the first time this has happened with an app. I wanted to take the IQ test and after around 10 minutes I completed. Thinking it was completely free I was shocked to find out that I had to buy ANOTHER plan not on top of my already existing one. I wish you just said that before I answer 60 questions.
1,JoeFrat1,"I gave them a suggestion about updating a game, they completely ignored ignored the issue, and proceeded to develop the game in to utter trash, pun intended. Go thing I don‚Äôt have to pay for this app since I payed for a lifetime subscription when it launched. I‚Äôd say if you want to keep customers, listen to them, otherwise it‚Äôs bad business."

1,Joseph Reyna,I‚Äôm all for testing the limits of our brains. However it‚Äôs somewhat annoying that these is a subscription based game.

5,Keba28,"Fun, quick and addictive. My wife told me about the application. Tried it on her phone and decided it to purchase it. Good choice!!"
1,averyboiii,"Money making scam, it‚Äôs the same type of tests you get on facebook ads but with clever sounds, haptics, and graphics that make it cute.  They force you to pay a ridiculous subscription of 7$ a week or $30 a year (this is advertised as a 92% discount of course)   After you do your test that just took you 10 minutes to take, they only show you a portion of your results and once again ask you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to see the rest ( this is after already having the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù, the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt give you any sort of access to the app‚Äù   Junk, dotn get it."
3,dndsahni,Loved this in the past. Really unique daily games that were quick and fun to do. Way too many ads now which makes getting to each game distracting.
1,ChristinePA19083,You spend some time answering tons of questions to learn it‚Äôs free for 3days and after that you have to pay. Feels misleading to call it free when it‚Äôs only free for 3 days and then you‚Äôre on the hook. I uninstalled immediately but not sure if that canceled the free trial that automatically turns to be being billed at the end of said trial
5,Halfpintnana,This brain memory game is great!! Keeps you on your toes and really exercises your brain and keeps it fit while you have fun!!

5,DullerTagg,"I‚Äôm not sure how effective it‚Äôll be yet, but it‚Äôs a fun little activity to pass some time. Hopefully it actually has some positive impact."

5,Ear3371,Need something to focus on and not think about other things this  is it
5,1225Kitty,This is only my second day playing Impulse. I am in love with it! The games can be played anywhere as the content is only visual.

5,Ingrita031671,Love the app. I look forward each day to see what the next challenge will be.
1,DelaneyDMM,The free trial to this app is not a free trial. The moment you do tests (complete 72 questions and waste your time) it hides the results & tries to force you out of the free trial and pay annually or for a full week. What is the point of offering a free trial if you don‚Äôt let subscribers utilize it? You‚Äôre taking our info and not providing the results unless we pay.
5,Saphyer,I just started using Impluse and so far I am enjoying this app. I will circle back after longer use and reevaluate.
5,Cakers44,Love the games! It‚Äôs so much fun and really relaxing. You‚Äôll be hooked. It really makes you think. I feel it‚Äôs helping me perform better.

1,Me123246,I thought this looked interesting so decided to try the ‚Äúfree trial ‚Äú they app immediately removed $22:99 from my bank account ! Its supposed to be free for 3 days then $6:99 a week. On what planet is this free? It‚Äôs actually fraudulent and I will be reporting this to Apple. I also tried to contact the company and it doesn‚Äôt let you send messages. Beware! Total ripoff!
5,Stonealicious,I‚Äôm pleased with the brain training games that I‚Äôve played so far . Good ways to keep sharp.

5,Legal O,Great fun training your brain. It also highlights where you have weaknesses so you can get better
5,Dadmc55,"Impulse brain games are fun and have a lot of variety.  Most other games are annoying with lots of flashing treasure chests, gems, jewels, coins, and noises. Impulse brain games are the best!"
4,wheniride,I usually play spider solitaire and I really like the variety of all of these games here plus I feel like I'm doing something good for my brain and not just playing a game.

5,Jslam187,This set of tests really tests your cognitive functioning and helps to train your thought patterns. I highly recommend this platform.
5,deb3am,It‚Äôs challenging but not so much that you don‚Äôt want to try again and do better
5,Niquemdgasc,"I only have the free trial but, I like it. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs working because today makes two days so as of now I like it. Games are easy."
1,huhffhsisj,Why you gotta pay to do anything man. I ain‚Äôt wanna unlock everything I‚Äôd rather just stick to the basics or free stuff but there‚Äôs no way to pass it. You HAVE to pay or do a free trial. It‚Äôs stupid when you could just get other 100% free apps and games that do the exact same thing as this would. Honestly just go take a buzzfeed test or something.
5,CarsonsWifey,"Definitely one of the best brain apps due to its variety of games, quizzes and fun all wrapped in one.  I like the detailed directions and detailed results."
5,Definitely download this app!,I love the daily reminders to do my mind workout for the day. You can choose how long you play every day and it‚Äôs a lot of fun!

5,BestMeasures,Just started a couple of days ago. So far so good. I‚Äôll let you know in a few weeks if I feel I am sharper.
1,didnekdiwl,"One of those apps that seem free to download then hits you with a paywall . It asks you a million questions, then at the last second asks for you to pay to use the app, essentially wasting your time. Hate this kind of tactic and you should avoid it if you do too"
5,J Leake,I love this app! It‚Äôs great for different areas of the brain. You can custom what you want your focus to be and go from there! Def recommend this app!!
4,Maish 05,I have had similar apps before but this one has some interesting games so far and I will give a more detailed review after a few months.
1,Dane sperman,"Downloaded the game, was forced to subscribe after a few great levels, then got stuck playing the absolute worst game ‚Äúcandy sort‚Äù for 100 levels, couldnt do anythinh but play the most boring game over and over and over and over and over and it never ended. Do not download. Do not fall for being forced to subscribe."

4,hay julie,Impulse is amazing even if you have to pay for a few things but allows you to learn and improve even without paying
5,Sndixon,It‚Äôs fun to do there is multiple different games and ways to keep you busy for hours!!!!
4,Ivelisse05,I like this brain game but after a while you kind of get bored with the same daily training. They should update it and add different ones.
3,perfect_c00kie,"These are fun mini games to play, but I don‚Äôt feel they offer much mental challenge (which was what I was looking for). I will stay with Lumosity and Elevate which I like better for that purpose."

5,J√©r√¥me J.,"Very fun games, informative tests, and self improvement exercises. Would highly recommend."
1,Tacit-Bud,"First they bait you with all the offered/available perks they offer. Then they scrape your information with the ‚Äúgames‚Äù they run you through in the initial run of the app, to gain additional data from you to later then monetize. And then, to view your results of those initially performed tests, they then ask you to pay?  Good one! üòÇ"

5,squirtinDirt,Simple enough to understand games but make you pay attention. Prevents me from doom scrolling on social media
3,cataybee,Things seem so easy not sure it‚Äôs helping me maintain a healthy brain but maybe it is.  I‚Äôm only in the three day trial time so it‚Äôs hard to say.  I might not continue with it but I do want to exercise my brain in unique ways.

2,Gabe Greyson,They‚Äôll let you take a whole test and then give you a pay wall to see the results. They‚Äôll let you sit there and waste your time. You couldn‚Äôt just not made the test available. Untrustworthy and shows a glimpse into the developers real motives.
5,Big mamma G,I like Impulse because it‚Äôs different from all the other brain exercise apps I‚Äôve tried before.
1,NikkiJ2448,They offer a 3 day free trial but then require you to join a membership after each test you take to see the results. I can‚Äôt give an honest feed back on the test because I‚Äôm not paying for an app I‚Äôm not sure will benefit me at all. Downloaded this app today and will be deleting today! Don‚Äôt waste your time!

5,soozcat,The games are great! There‚Äôs always something new to challenge your brain.
2,FilthyToxin,"Its a good app, but i wont rate more than 2 until you make more stuff free. You could make more money from adding advertising and making people pay to remove advertising and add premium features for premium members only. Just some food for thought"

1,Hercules8D,"Another app that is free to download and you get hit by the paywall immediately.

Also, there was no way to enter the correct answer on brain teasers, so how can it count whether or not my answer was correct. 5 star app brought down to 2 stars for misleading.  Update to developer: I don‚Äôt think you read my review. The 30-day free trial is over after only 5 days. I cannot proceed without paying or trying the three day trial. One star."
4,Zuxo Powell,They have endless games and tests to fill whatever problem you have
1,whutevvuhh,"I wanted to test out this thing and it seemed really cool but then after the archetypal test it wants to charge me for the results m Like bruh a free trial should be a free trial, not something just said but still have zero real access to anything  Garbage for misleading their free trial so I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm really into it and don‚Äôt think I should spend the money on this"

2,lackofpies,They don‚Äôt have a free version Their free trial is only three days Then it‚Äôs $7 per week!!!  I guess if you‚Äôre really serious about what they offer it might be worth it. I just wanted to check it out for fun but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be an option

1,Jdunavan,You can't access pretty much anything worth while with out paying. The free trial doesn't give you full access and ends up charging you even after you canceled it. Insane amount of ads. Scroll through the almost 500k reviews and look at the 5 star reviews. Tell me thats real people

1,MrsLilBerg,They trick you into thinking you can do all these personality tests while using the free trial so it lets you do a ten minute test with 72 questions and then at the end it tells you you have to subscribe immediately and it‚Äôs $6.99 A WEEK. That is not worth it for some low grade quizzes. Immediately deleted the app. Seems very gimmicky.

Marketing makes it out to be a puzzle game, after Download it indicates it‚Äôs some kind of ‚Äúbrain trainer.‚Äù Completely misled into downloading and then it tried to get me to lock in a sub before I‚Äôd even tried anything. Would not recommend."

2,TheBigEnigma,"Don‚Äôt waste your time. If you‚Äôre looking for brain exercises, use literally any other platform. First thing I‚Äôm greeted with upon opening the app is ads. No thanks.

5,Dom Kat,Love how they challenge you to work your brain ‚Ä¶. These are my kind of games i really like them
2,monkbernardo,You‚Äôd better be ready to pay for this because even the trial wouldn‚Äôt give me a result without locking in a longer-term subscription paid for today. Be sure you want it before you download or you‚Äôll be cancelling and deleting like I‚Äôm about to.
5,CnLibo,"I like having games for times when I‚Äôm waiting or bored, and I love these because they are fun and helpful"
5,BigSchick1,This game is much much better than scrolling!!

5,Jenn Ram 34,It‚Äôs hard to stop playing the games! They‚Äôre all so fun!! I look forward to challenging myself!
5,Wqaasww,The games are actually fun and helping understand how fast my brain is and also exercises it
2,RedRaven523,The word guess game stopped randomizing words about 3 days ago. It stuck on the word ‚Äúworld‚Äù and does it over and over. When you close the game and go back in the same thing happens. I love this game and many others but this is very frustrating.
4,CsVme,I like being able to get a baseline then trying to improve over time. I want my brain operating at peak performance.
5,TdaiFour000,"This app is Literally amazing for when you want to pass time, I‚Äôm in the hospital rn and this is just such a great way to past time."
5,breehawaii3,I love being able to practice challenging games and finding myself get better!
5,amyleepatron,These games are great and have helped me with recovery from a TBI. I unfortunately am unable to pay for add free play so it‚Äôs a LOT of adds but worth it for the benefits.
5,Pulsewisetime,Is fun because you can keep trying to do better.  Better you do mire points you can get
5,Chloe's nickname,I think impulse is the best educational game ever since everyone gets addicted to electronics I try to learn off of them and I think this is the best game to learn!‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Iwannaretire,"Your brain needs a workout every day, and this is a fun way to stay sharp!"
5,Daisy1263,Great app- works your brain in many different ways but you really don‚Äôt notice because the games & puzzles are so fun!!
3,Heather5551,The games on this app are fun but the amount of ads on the free version are not worth it. You play one round of games and have to sit through a 30 second ad. It‚Äôs a waste of time.
5,Vianneymt,To sharp your brain is better that watch tiktoks or scroll down in pictures
5,rosifresit,I like the variety of games and keep my brain alert and making new neuronal connections.
5,Javonna Jane,"I love the brain exercises. My mind needs a little exercise, so thank you for this well thought out brain app."

1,joeeeeeeeemamama89,I am so tired of downloading puzzle games and constantly having to watch ads after every level. I think i‚Äôve spent more time watching ads than playing the games that would be ‚Äúhelping my wellbeing‚Äù   It‚Äôs also the fact that all the ads are the same thing. Over and over again they are showing the same game or even more puzzles.   I tried to play it on airplane mode to get rid on them but the app can‚Äôt even run correctly without wifi.   It‚Äôs actually insane that I would have to be paying $40 for no ads.
5,miss veneca,Give yourself the opportunity to train your brain changing your routine.  Try this app and live the experience!
4,Crochetowl,"Since the last update, the reminders aren‚Äôt coming through."

5,Happy Gilmore1357908642,Honestly? i‚Äôm just kinda loving this. I switched from social media to playing games that make me feel quick and good. L
5,creep #400001,I love to play this when I need to destress and feel like my brain is still working on problem solving.

5,Ninja60384,This app is amazing. I don‚Äôt pay for the plan it‚Äôs only short adds that you. An skip through.
5,CLWood1006,Very interesting games but wish it didn‚Äôt cost any money to get a bigger challenge.

5,TJWD999,I live the challenge of the games. It definitely makes my brain work at a higher level.
5,alrightyboy,Combines all those games we‚Äôve played before in a DuoLingo type game that helps train your brain
1,Mercury122,The second I opened the app I had to watch an add. Did one challenge that took 5 seconds and was hit with another. Ruined the experience. Ads should be used for rewards or something. Not forced. I uninstalled and I‚Äôm sure everyone else will to once they see. This is like those io games. Never ending advertisements.
5,Daniel Wimberly,With everything
5,QAL 7,"In the best way possible, I don‚Äôt even prefer to play games on my phone but this has captured ny attention.  Very addictive."
1,Rosegovia86@,"This is a scam, check online the amount of people who have been scammed by this people. You download the app, you go to the trial version and they tell you they will charge you after the 3 day period and automatically they grab from your card not only one but 2 times the amount!  Ive been charged for a weekly and a yearly subscription a total of 35usd! And i used it for 20 min.  Please never download I realized and cancel through thw Apple subscription the trial period the same moment, and they charged me anyway and the app came back by it self to active subscription! Awful"
5,TW32AH,This game is so much better than the mindless collecting and matching games. I play this at work on my breaks as a way to unwind but keep my brain active.

5,Computer King,"Rlly does help get my brain going and helps my memory, how fast I think & the quality of my answer!"
5,Reggie37Boi,"Love it hate the adds, not paying the price to remove the adds though ugh"
4,Nefariousgoon,"It‚Äôs really fun puzzles, I‚Äôm not gonna lie. If you try it and think ‚Äúthis person is lying, this is lame‚Äù keep in mind I‚Äôm also autistic, so my type of fun is probably different from yours lol"
4,doesn't have attitude,The only issue I had with this game is like 12x8 I just didn‚Äôt think that was very simple to me but overrall definitely not bad
5,badhanooth,You never know what tasks in life are more challenging. The tests paired with life show ahead of task where I should pay more attention.
5,APate56,The different types of games makes me think about what I should do and the speed I can achieve them! Great game!!
5,kkbbriccw,"This game keep me occupied and it helps me think more, so if your that type of person then i think this game will suit you a lot!"
2,u77,"1. Way toooo much ads, 2. the games are not challenging at all even at level 20 and  3. The app freezes after an add three time in less than 15 minutes! Definitely does not wotht even $1 a year! Two stars because it has several ‚Äúgames‚Äù."

5,danamoraki,I love the app so much that I started the day with it. It keeps my brain sharp and gives me so much satisfaction completing all the levels.
5,Boogaloo rada,I like the app. They told me if I wanted to help them I could leave a 5 star review. The other button only said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to help‚Äù.

5,Alyssah96,Interesting games that make me think. Keeps me on my toes and feel like I can keep the cobwebs away.
1,AL010101010101,"I did not pay for premium, so maybe it is better, but the free stuff is a joke and seems like it‚Äôs meant for a child. It is not challenging. They want you to upgrade for almost everything. For those who pay for the upgrade, I sure hope it‚Äôs a lot better than the free version. Deleting app."
4,LyLa.UR.bEstIe,So I saw an add for it on TikTok saying that it would tell me my iq and that‚Äôs why I downloaded it. It‚Äôs pretty much really easy mini games but it is still fun 7/10. Hope this helps

5,Sailor114,Definitely have seen an increase in focus and memory. It‚Äôs fun but has some challenges to it.
1,k176891!,"Don‚Äôt do the ‚Äúfree trial.‚Äù Not worth it for how quickly they start charging. Look at that cost per WEEK it charges + there are NO instructions for how to unsubscribe (which is through your Apple account btw). While it‚Äôs common to have automatic subscription after a trial, the fact that the app has no guidance on how to cancel leads me to think they are being intentionally difficult."
5,Crystalpcw,I guess we will see longer results over time
5,BassamSP,Not only are you training your brain but you‚Äôre also have a fun time!

5,wolffj1,Nice to have something simple and fast to train on the go!
3,nerkles,"Please enable family sharing, this is too expensive to pay for each person."
5,Lillyloveexo,"Very easy app, games are great. There‚Äôs a very big variety of them that have helped me a lot with my memory."

1,vac1992vac,You will spend 5 minutes getting through their obnoxious advertisements that have nothing to do with you or your interests and lead you on a wild goose chase to the App Store just to finally be able to play a 30 second brain game that is subpar. Don‚Äôt use this app.
5,Retired camping nana,Challenging and fun. Love to play the different memory games and also see where I rank with others.

5,msagustin,Awesome App to help maintain and train the membranes in your brain.  Very affordable and I would give it 10 stars if I could get a Lifetime Subscription.
1,macalex01,Can‚Äôt even try this without paying!  ****Update to developer response - obviously you haven‚Äôt tried to use your own app. Because what you stated is NOT accurate. It would not even allow me to continue free without selecting a PAID plan. It said I would have 3 Days free trial but I had to agree to a paid plan first!!    No Thanks!
5,Katermurph28,"Instead of doom scrolling, I plan impulse and it feels like I‚Äôm doing something better than just zoning out on social media."

2,Kindplanet12,Why even let me sit there and take the tests and quizzes and such when you‚Äôre gonna make me pay to see the results? Feels like I‚Äôm just wasting my time ü§∑ should tell me BEFORE I do the things that I‚Äôm not gonna be able to read it unless I pay 10 dollars smh

1,Thegowt999,I done the free trial and took a personality test all the way through just to get to the end and it was going to make me pay $5 to see what just took 10 mins out of my life to do.

5,"Vegas, Alaska","Nothing wrong with keeping the mind sharpe with these kind of games, Highly recommend!!"
1,Jakegoox,"I signed up for the free three day trial, I cancel before it renews so I don‚Äôt accidentally pay for something I won‚Äôt use in case I don‚Äôt like it. I take a quiz and it tells me I still have to spend money to see the results of it, despite the trial being well‚Ä¶ a trial. It‚Äôs just another business with consumer unfriendly practices."

1,alisha j f,The trial is called ‚ÄúUnlimited Pro Access‚Äù but the test results are locked behind a subscription paywall. I contacted support from their website and got no response. The trial is only 3 days long; I predict that by the time someone replies (if at all) my trial will already be over. Extremely frustrating.

1,Egoore1,This app is a money grab by the developers. Even the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù doesn‚Äôt include anything free - everything worth trying is hidden behind a paywall.   Hopefully the developers make the free trial more inclusive in the future - it‚Äôs not a very helpful tool to determine whether it would be worth it to shell out the money to unlock certain features.

2,tvd2018,"It‚Äôs okay but every time I try to take the IQ test, it says that my internet connection failed. But the games and puzzles work fine and my internet connection is strong. The IQ Test was the main reason I downloaded this app, so I will be canceling my subscription."
1,LELCOMM,"While the initial download is free and you can play a few of the games, you are constantly bombarded with ads and upgrade messages. The ads are annoying and there seems to be no way to get out of them once they start unless you close the app."

5,Edgro,I have really enjoyed playing this game!!  I have learned that my brain works pretty good!!  I never felt this good about myself!!
1,n0bleprincess,I did a trial with you guys but I canceled before it ended and you still kept charging my card for the year subscription. I kept trying to contact someone but there‚Äôs. No customer service option. And now my card is negative and I‚Äôm trying to get a refund. Please. I canceled before the trial ended.
5,Re@lLIZ,Best game you can get yourself!  Too busy having fun that you don‚Äôt even realize your learning.

1,Hermiony56,You can take half these tests for free just on the internet with a quick google. This app required a subscription or to pay once to even get a test result AFTER TAKING THE TEST so you go through all that time just to be told you cant see the results unless you pay them.
5,Hazel eyes92420,I‚Äôve been trying it out and I really like it I‚Äôm thinking about purchasing for the year
4,Junebugg04,Memory tiles could use a speed up they flip too easily leaving the challenge not so much of a challenge

5,DonCarreto,My missing tool to master my mind‚Ä¶great fun games in my personal opinion from someone that does not play any games‚Ä¶except real life Monopoly üòé
5,Bobandyo,"ive always loved strategic puzzles and thinking ahead and seeing how far my logic can go and this is just a fun trainer. i have to say these games and puzzles are pretty cool but chess is still outmatched and will always be my favorite strategy game, however this deserves five stars. the only down side to this is that u have to pay for most of these puzzles and chess is free"

3,Jemmah S.,"I like this game, but some of the things are too easy. I feel like the percentage at the end is wrong because there is no way I did one simple thing and outsmarted 99% of my peers. Are people really this dumb?????"
2,MEEPTHEGREAT,"This app contains multiple subscription fees and payments that are not advertised on the app store. The overall app would be decent if not for that. This app is truly completely useless. If you are struggling go see a mental health professional, don‚Äôt download an overpriced app."

5,QKristen A,"I love that this is a game, but also knowing that I am working my brain.  In addition to the games I enjoy the tests like the iQ test and others."
1,ArtiMano24,Absolutely unable to cancel subscription. Purchased through Apple and it does not show up anywhere for me stop renewal.

1,Shanellasaur,Every time I try to do the daily games it gets stuck on the arrow direction game. None of the arrows show up so I have to close the game out completely. I've tried deleting and redownloading the game and it still doesn't work. I searched for a help option but couldn't find any.

It says when you sign up that you can cancel anytime, but there is no cancellation feature in the settings and no contact information (or at least they do not respond to the one support email in the terms of service). You don‚Äôt need this app."

2,christian0859,I gave it a 2 star because I spent 2 hours on it just to not see my results because I had to pay to see that‚Äôs. Thats redicoulous. I think they should make at least 1 test you take free and not make you pay to see the results.

1,Iopip,The app lets you spent time taking tests and doesn‚Äôt make it clear what is included in your  membership and then prompts you to sign up for another tier to unlock the results of a test you just spent ten minutes. The app is filled with text book dark patterns. The developers should be ashamed.
1,Joshjosh1337,"Joke of an app for advertising being a brain development, attention and focus app. Trashy spam ads constantly pop up. Most require 15 seconds to bypass, advocating gambling‚Ä¶ 15 seconds of doing a challenge another one pops up. The 5 star reviews have to be boosted. Don‚Äôt bother with this trash."
5,Thaddeus Karmichael,"I like it. It‚Äôs cool, easy to work into your day to day schedule. Offers some insight on the mind too that I had not previously considered"
3,Lenora Fletch R.,We are not given enough time to complete exercises. It should start with something reasonable and then the time can decrease as you get closer to 100%. This current process takes away the fun.
1,Gorsey lane,"After doing this daily for six months, recently in the middle of the daily games I received a flash message that I had been logged off and lost every record of improvement‚Ä¶.every game and badge was set back to zero.  I have written twice to no avail‚Ä¶..very disappointing."

5,ging lambert,I have just started and within the first game I realized the value this will bring to my overhaul brain health.
2,dustinmyglass,"Before my trial expires, I run into two puzzles with wrong answers. The correct answer to 8+2+7 should be 17 not 23. Another puzzle claims 5+6+3=23. And another claims 6+4+10=34. I think the developer needs some brain training first before writing brain training app."
5,MiamiMarty,I thoroughly enjoy the games. And it‚Äôs great they are quick so you can take them very conveniently
5,betsy724,This helps with memorization. I have been less forgetful and I stay o. Track more with daily work!

3,ACE_USER,"Far too many long ads in free version, some requiring as many as 6 clicks to move through them. Lost me as a user."
4,Penelope Jane<3,"You can still play a lot of fun games that help your brain het active, but not everything is free, like the tests."
4,Mickeyd1369,"I really enjoy playing the games, dislike all the ads and having to pay to get rid of the ads."
3,Hyperzombia,"You spend time aking a test, wait for the results to be calculated, and then it says you have to pay a not-small amount to see them. This alone ruins any positive impressions I had for the app."

5,J.J Miller,Good way to keep your self in check!
1,Cables55,I answered all your questions and then it automatically went to free trial and I didn‚Äôt agree to it and it went on into game and said if I don‚Äôt cancel it will charge me .

2,uhlyssuhhhh,"The games are fun and some can be challenging, however you need to pay for full access to all the games. Either $40 for a life time or $6.99 per WEEK. You can start a 3 day free trial however you need to cancel it at least 24hours before the end of the trial. So it‚Äôs essentially a 48 hour trial."
3,Keefer Reviews,"I downloaded for the metal stacking game and couldn‚Äôt find it and there wasn‚Äôt much games like it this is a little pricey also, but I was able to cancel the subscription really easy in the Apple Store setting"
1,Lizzles Magee,"I downloaded this app for less than a day and then deleted it. It charged me three weeks for the weekly subscription. I am very angry and feel scammed as I never opted into a subscription, I only downloaded the app. I would love a refund for the $30 out of my tiny college paycheck that was wasted on an undownloaded app. This company is ridiculous and I am beyond upset. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE MONEY!!!!"
5,TheNerdWord,The puzzles actually help with time. And I think the one time payment deal is worth it.

5,SBG2014,So far it‚Äôs been great and way better than playing candy crush.
1,Augameister,"If you offer a free trial but don‚Äôt unlock the features to try out, then it really isn‚Äôt a free trial. I played the daily games (free) & then spent the time to test for Archetype. However, they don‚Äôt tell you until the end of the test that you can only get it if you give up your free trial & become a paid member."
5,Darrylüòèüòèüòè,Very fun you have an option to pay for it or not and it makes you smarter 5 stars
4,Morefreegames42,It would be great if it came with a few more free games. Or at least games with a lower level that you can play continuously.
3,AliceLPSü¶Ñ,I intensely dislike the way these programs ask Me to Praise their work product after ‚Äúusing the program‚Äù for 3.5 seconds ‚Ä¶ oh gee .. isnt our App the best thing ever ‚Ä¶ TELL the World.   With all that said and after denying a half dozen times or more my opportunity to praise the programmers and everyone else who had contributed to this App.  Here it is.  Seems worthwhile .. i would bless your endeavors to improve possibly your brain functions by using this App.

3,GRHHCGU,I downloaded the app to relax and enjoy the puzzles and games. But instead I‚Äôm more frustrated by the amount of ads that pop up after EVERY round.
1,ppppppesnsbsisi,"Bad app in my opinion. You have to pay for everything. I wanted to take one test and ended up taking a 40 question test, just for it to tell me I have to pay to see my answers. Waste of time. A lot of people that want to help their mental health they don‚Äôt have money to spend on things like this."

1,tbrailer,"The app doesn't show up in your subscriptions in the app store, so you can't unsubscribe. Nor are there options to do so within the app. I had to write to Apple for a refund!  *edit after developer response*  Developer, read carefully: YOUR APP DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THE SUBSCRIPTIONS SECTION (or vlanywhere in the link you posted) SO I LITERALLY AM UNABLE TO UNSUBSCRIBE. THIS IS YOUR RESPONSILITY."

5,{B}ean,"For someone who struggles with attention and impulse, this game is a great start to a greater journey of self-control and sharpness. 5stars"
1,_.rositaa,The game itself can be fun but is not worth it at all unless you intend on purchasing the subscription because there are ads after nearly every level and when trying to dismiss the pop ups it opens them instead
4,Katie Florencin,Impulse is something I really never thought would be challenging and it‚Äôs like a sharpener that sharpens brains. This app makes me feel confident for my next year class.

1,Meleni13,"Great concept but you are literally bombarded with ADS like you were in AOL pop up days.  Do not, I repeat DO NOT pay to ‚Äúskip‚Äù ADS because this feature is only directed at the one game AD. Imagine paying $2.99 for each AD skip?  People we‚Äôre approaching a recession save your money. Plenty of FREE alternatives out there."
5,Anniebek,I love this app and all the brain training games it offers. Highly recommend!

5,siaras a baby,Yesterday my dad wanted me to download this app and i did.... because why not- so i started playing this and i‚Äôm feeling addicted
3,Briannnnmmmm,It‚Äôs a cool looking app if you buy it but the adds are insanely annoying if you just want to test it out. You guys would sell more product if you cut that crap out. And what‚Äôs up with the annual fee? what ever happened to buying something to own it?
5,brennannicolel,I‚Äôm so happy I downloaded this app. I‚Äôm having trouble with my memory this is a fun app that also helps.
1,Domo the homo,There is no option to cancel in settings in the app. They purposely make it hard to cancel by not providing any cancelation instructions anywhere. I emailed support one day after I downloaded and never heard back from them. It was only after reading another review that I found out how to cancel. Biggest waste of money.
5,usuarianewcool,Very fun game with a bunch of tests available to know where you can work on regarding your brain.
2,Lenore D.,"The app was great, so I paid the $15 for a year w/o ads. I‚Äôve contacted the developer weeks ago stating that at the end of the ‚Äúsorting candies‚Äù game, the last ball freezes every single time. No response and the last ball still freezes ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,nikki12490,Love the challenging yet not too difficult brain exercises. Deff something that helps me decompress and relax once I‚Äôm in bed for the night.

5,Hi There Haley,This is a great app that challenges my mind and keeps me entertained too.
5,Puppy Dancer,This better than playing some other meaningless gameüòÇ
2,PTT317,Don‚Äôt waste your time. There‚Äôs maybe 10 different games they rotate on a daily basis and you can only hope you get a better score each time. Becomes rather boring quickly

5,emiloverly71,I find this much more rewarding than scrolling through social media.

1,Lmm Indy,"The free trial is a complete scam. I signed up for the three day free trial with supposed unlimited access. I played a few games and then took one of their quizzes. But in order to see the results of the quiz, you have to buy the full membership. And read the fine print. It‚Äôs $6.99 a week!"

Classic issue with apps, but this one is on the bad side.  And now the reason I‚Äôm deleting the app: took 7 minutes to answer 84 questions on a personality test, and then it said I needed to pay to see the results. TELL ME THAT BEFORE I WASTE MY TIME!!

If you don‚Äôt choose any they for you to watch a 30 second ad then somehow it forces the Apple store to open and ask you if you want to download what ever app just got advertised. This ridiculous and no I don‚Äôt want to pay 8 dollars a week to play this.
1,Lane23451,"I downloaded this app, come to find it has a 3 day free trial, after that you have to pay 6.99 per week to use it. No thanks.

1,thewallypug,"I signed up for a free trial but was charged for a  year when I checked a couple days later.  Sellers are not responding to my pleas for my money back. I will try again. I don't  enjoy most of the ""games""  many are too simple ( I learned arithmetic in Miss Butler's 2nd grade). That would be okay if you could choose to skip some and go to a advanced level. I 've wondered if some of the exercises are timed; it's a possibility, but that is never mentioned. Maybe this app would be good for those people diagnosed with evolving dementia. I'm too impatient for it."

For starters, the math doesn‚Äôt work out since the yearly cost is $30, and secondly, my card was immediately charged for $30 so the 3-day ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù was also a lie. Very shady. Be warned."

1,Jimmerz1976,Subscription based games are ruining the entire gaming experience.. especially on mobile platforms such as iOS.   What happened to buying a game and just being able to play? Why does everyone now want a weekly or monthly cut of my working income?
5,sammiesp,Love it. The ability to get mini brain work outs throughout a mundane work day really helps

5,Rushblvd,"I just downloaded the App., and I must say it is fun and addicting. There are many games to play, and somewhat diverse."
1,DeanOsCustoms,"I feel compelled to rate this game as it is false advertising on two fronts. It is not free, but costs a $7/week subscription to even try the 3 day trial. It is also rated (at the time) number 1 in health and fitness. Maybe educational‚Ä¶but even if this solved all the mental problems in the world, doesn‚Äôt deserve to be number 1 in health and FITNESS."
1,Tgrmag,"I got this app as it‚Äôs FB add claimed it had tests to help you with ADHD. Loading it all I see are generic brain training tests, and even more generic personality quests from click bait sites.

5,maccma,With having had COVID brain fog which impaired my working memory. This has been helping regain my function.
1,evclimbs,I love solving problems.  Games that test my reaction time and peripheral vision and not problems to be solved.  I selected the problem solving option and I got reaction time junk.  Could be that this is cause I didn‚Äôt pay any thing but I am certainly not tempted to buy the app in the slightest.

2,Jargooooo,"While this app aims to keep your mind fresh by a series of games/puzzles, it also grinds it into mush by forcing you to watch a 30 second ad between every match.  The games are entertaining but the commercial brakes get old quick."

1,Complainee99,"Before you can access anything, they want you to try a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù and then be charged after 3 days.   I try to download apps that are honest about their in app purchases. If it‚Äôs only allowed to be used if you pay for it or commit to pay for it, I don‚Äôt want to download that app."
5,Sannkristin,Have made my one day challenge! Looking forward to more!

1,LurcottTX,This app is terrible. Puzzles are nothing like the Insta adds.   I feel sorry for anyone that pays for this or pays money for in game upgrades.   It is worthless garbage like all the puzzle apps I have tried so far. If you can‚Äôt solve them all you have bigger issues in life to figure out.

1,edcgbhuqasw,You can take a handful of tests for free but results are all blocked by a pay wall. You are able to see the title of what you are but not the full results‚Ä¶ it is a great waste of 20 minutes if you want to download it I suppose.

5,JT763B3,Great memory game. Gambling advertisements get in the way. Definitely not healthy if you are trying to work the brain. Gambling creates addiction.
5,joyjoy001,So much better than scrolling through social media. I love how fun and interactive the games are. I typically play on my lunch break
2,N8T@L!3,"Almost downloaded after seeing Facebook ads. Realized, after reading reviews, that I had it before and the subscription cgarges are ridiculous. Sad because it seems like a great app but overcharging isn't fun."
1,1516483920975241718,"Hate the games like these that I end up downloading from an add. The add version of the game always looks interesting, then when you go to download it‚Äôs completely different unless you pay for a membership. Just ridiculous. Deleting it almost as fast as I downloaded it."
5,TANTANBanban,I think I might actually pay for the premium membership for lifetime.
1,hshshhdhs,When you first download it you get super easy puzzles which only take about 1 second to complete but in the free version you have to watch two 30 second ads before you can play a level. In about 10 mins I actually played the game for about 3 mins and spent 7 mins on ads
1,pochaccu,"I was so excited to use this app! But it crashes during start up every single time I try to open it. I‚Äôve tried clearing more space on my phone and turning it off/on several times but nothing made a difference. Might be a bug, hope it is because I still really wanna use this app. (iPhone 8 if it matters)"
5,dednside1086,I feel accomplished after playing these games

4,Circumcised bad noy,Just started but I am enjoying the challenge of the different puzzles/problems.
2,bambidybambam,Without a subscription this app is a waste of space in your phone. The subscription is more money annually than my investing app that actually makes me money so I would genuinely never invest in this as it‚Äôs unreasonably priced‚Ä¶$1 a day is insane.
5,mhipes,My brain feels like a day at the gym and enjoys this far more than scrolling social media
5,PREDARDO,Excellent for challenging the brain.
4,handreasen10,Excellent way to keep your mind sharp with easy to understand activities that do not take much time.
5,Reyna moon,It helps when I feel to act on impulse or when I feel anxious.
3,Hunkalibra,love this game but pls do less adds it‚Äôs rlly annoying and takes down the overall experience of the app. i shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to enjoy an app
2,tgbsyo,Lack of update on puzzles and word searches so you can‚Äôt move onto the next level even if you wanted to.   I updated mine and my 188 day streak vanished even though I played yesterday. Now I‚Äôm back to 0.  This is a good work out for your brain but it doesn‚Äôt have everything you need to level up which is frustrating. How can I hit the 500 day streak when it keeps putting me back to 0 with every update?!  Not worth it.
1,Quetin,"As usual with free games, it desperately tries to sell you a subscription, then offers you an ad free version (also a subscription) and then hits you with trick click ads every other game. I say game, but it‚Äôs basically a simple task. Draw a line, tap the match tile, swallow your spit, great job! Here is another ad!"
5,Deth9911,This app is amazing! I tried it and ended up buying the lifetime deal. I am so happy with this :)

5,alwayslynne,This game is exciting and fun. It makes you think and makes it fun at the same time!
1,festatichiama,this app is almost $30 and you still have to have your games interrupted all the time with horrible trashy ads. This is extremely frustrating when you're right in the middle of a high stakes game

5,Teresieresie92,I just downloaded it and love that it gives a tests to get my brain awake and working

1,BadlyDrawnNoble,"It sucked me in with the ads, and I enjoyed it for the short time I used it, but they are banking on that and then they hit you with a $7 a week fee! A week! Nearly $30 a month for this. That might work for some people, but I can‚Äôt handle that."

1,v-twin madness,"Its like pulling teeth getting into the app, being hit with requests for payment just to look at the thing.  I took the archetypes test, a 72 question test, and at the end demanded payment to view the results.  Calling it ‚Äúfree with in app purchases‚Äù is deceptive. Deleted immediately on principle."

5,Robbo007,"Not only is it a time killer, it helps you engage your focus to a T!"
1,Bookielfc,Ads in between every level of a game is ridiculous. Especially when it‚Äôs the one you advertise.  The initial intro is also too quick to try and get you to pay - and throw the FOMO premium discounts at you.   No problem with ads in general‚Ä¶understand the need and the freemium model‚Ä¶ but all of this was overdone to the point where the whole ‚Äúgood for your mental health‚Äù pitch is nothing more than a money grab.  Could have been a good app. Quickly became all about the money. Quickly deleted from my phone.
5,chalkybeats,"The human kind is complex, and so should be the ways that we use it! Impulse scratches all of the mental itches and allows me to guage your growth."

1,Jimmie99ma,"You can‚Äôt even try the game out before your hit with ads. It would be nice if there was a grace period like most games, before being bombarded with ads. Also they want you to buy the game before you test it out. Ever heard of try it before you buy it."
1,Oneandonly12321,I never write reviews on apps but this was just ridiculous. Navigating through the app is next to impossible without triggering an ad.

1,Winter 0921,You can‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt have the subscription to the app to access any results you need the subscription and it is a waste of your time if you thought that you would be able to learn more about yourself.
3,Anilew,This is not very challenging. Must the games snd puzzles are just a worthless way to pass time. I wish they had a few really hard puzzles.
2,Cheezor,"Game was fun, but the app was way to insistent that I sign up for premium or pay a ‚Äú1-time payment‚Äù to get my IQ report. I didn‚Äôt think there was anything in the free part that made it worth putting up with all that."
5,Masterchief91055,It‚Äôs just so entertaining because some of the questions are so trivial

1,M.Shiflett,"I fell for the Instagram ad, and downloaded this app to try. You can‚Äôt try anything without constant pop ups blocking you from seeing your results unless you pay for a subscription . The free trail is truly a scam. Also, 6.99/week? Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1,haleyh12345678,This app upgrades you to the premium plan and then charges you $7/week without telling you. I seriously don‚Äôt remember purchasing anything and then saw it card has been charged $7/week for months for an app I haven‚Äôt even played.

5,Best1966,When I‚Äôm restless or stressed with work I use to give my brain a break doing something fun.
1,EMHMLH,All they want is for people to buy a subscription to use the app. It doesn‚Äôt even really give you any time to really check out the app before you have to pay for a monthly subscription fee. Read the small print.
5,GuidedGoddess,Help me when I‚Äôm mad or have to much to think about helps my brain focus
5,Valoenichen,Good way to keep the brain active and you can have fun while doing it.

1,asdjsha1111,"I paid for the year, I have been doing this for a few months now, and at first it was fun. but quickly became boring and repetitive. All the challenges are the same you don‚Äôt learn anything new my advice try the free version and then move on"

5,Cindylubob,I like that there are so many different game choices and different catagories!
5,Hhhhhhhtrrrryoiudblgy b,Definitely a huge app
1,Jessieo16,I downloaded this because the adhd quiz kept being advertised to me. So I did the free trial and it‚Äôs nowhere to be found. I hate false advertising SO much. Do not offer something to me that doesn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm not going to turn around and pay for something that seemed available.

1,Nick S 113,Why would I have to subscribe to play this game and pay money every month when there are games on the App Store that are free that are exactly like this. Also your adds are false advertisement and should be more detailed about how you have to pay to play.
3,The MoVeMeNt,Loved this app for the first month or so.  The games become suuuuper redundant.  It‚Äôs the same thing day in and day out.  I guess it‚Äôs good for disappearing into for a minute but it‚Äôs hardly a GREAT brain app.

5,AngrySiriusSubscriber,Brain challenges to pass to time
1,RaWinchester89,Thought it was free until I got to the end of the questionnaire. Then it wanted me to pay. Thanks but no thanks. Said free all over it until they get you. They should just make you pay up front instead of trying to sneak it by you. Tired of this crap.
4,8878',I just started using it a few days ago it sharpened my mind in a few days I recommend it.
2,mfreeza,"It‚Äôs a really good App besides the non stop ads & pressure for you to buy something on the app, Way to many micro transactions and ads after every level gets super repetitive & annoying"
1,Kakata826383,I took a 60 question quiz only to be told that I had to upgrade or pay to see the results even though I was on the free trail and I never got a warning before.  What the heck I just wasted my time. I‚Äôm doing the free trail to see if I even want to try it out.

5,sammmmmnmm,Has tons of games and they are all well explained and easy to follow. No glitches or lags
5,Pau Rivera,"It was fun, entertaining and different. Nice to be able to see the score and data."

5,Tiffas,I like that this perks me up and especially helps me work on memory and concentration.
5,CJG momma,Love this app. Helping my brain and playing a game all in one. Nice get away from hustle and bustle of everyday life.
5,Tiz Riz,"Only two days in, but enjoying the exercises thus far."
5,Gaam79,"These games do help with memory, attention and organization I feel"

5,Ram II 2013,"Comparable with other similar apps, it is on the top. The best way to exercise your brain every day."
5,Lula Patula,I like the easy instructions and progress challenge
1,FeetPants,Thought this looked cool. Got to the screen that asked what subscription I wanted to pay for. I noped right out and deleted it. I don‚Äôt have a problem paying for games but that‚Äôs pretty ridiculous to charge that much on a weekly basis for a couple games.
5,suezyl8,This really works !  If you don‚Äôt use it you loose it!  This helps bring it back for reals
5,Not Your iCloud Account,Absolutely love this app and it is so cheap compared to others charging $150 bucks for a year ü•µ

4,FoodLover18,"This is an amazing app! However, using it before bedtime can put a strain on the eyes. Would love if they can add an option to turn on dark mode"
5,ankinayak_,I do enjoy the daily exercises and they don‚Äôt take long to play
4,adreviewpenny,"Great selection of games, a little too many ads but that‚Äôs the price you pay for a free game."
1,jerry282828,I‚Äôve tried to download this app a few times and every time I do I load it and I don‚Äôt get any further than the loading screen. There‚Äôs no way for my to start the game. Also I have a brand new iPhone 13 so there shouldn‚Äôt be any issue on my end
5,Koalakai,It‚Äôs fun and has a good variety of games that get more challenging as you would play.
5,AnaMaeeeeee,Once you play it you don't want to stop
5,the kid kg,A good game for people who need help with those things
5,tararae3473,Is lovely and pleasant as ever! I struggle with ADHD and I‚Äôve found peace on this and has a catchy way to keep me focused! So now I see real life as this game!!
4,ali_abbass167,"The app has great potential and is fun, but you either have to pay or you'll have an add every second"
5,Templo run,They show different thing in their ads that are not in the game
1,NugiNugi,Ads ads and more ads. You can‚Äôt play a game without seeing ads unless you pay for it. How do they have such high ratings. If you select most recent reviews there‚Äôs like 30 1-stars in row. They must bought reviews early on the app life cycle.
1,Sarahjanel,I don‚Äôt mind ads every now and then but not after every single game you play that only takes ten seconds to play and then you have to watch an ad. You don‚Äôt even get to experience what the games are because your overwhelmed with ads. I deleted the app.
5,gghhjjkiyt,Enjoy playing the games can be relaxing and challenging
5,Jrknappster,This game is very user friendly and seems to be very accurate in its assessments.

5,ShellYeahBaby,So many games‚Ä¢Pleasant graphics‚Ä¢Enjoy daily:)
5,Rxavier1979,"Strongly suggested for anyone who‚Äôs trying to maintain cognitive function, or even sharpen."
1,Lbug8899,You can do the tests if you do the free trial.  However you have to pay to see the results of the test.  Really confused how there‚Äôs even a free trial. Also this is very very loosely based psychology that isn‚Äôt even correct. The tests are highly inaccurate and obviously not a real psychological test.
1,Fabiano_Carrera,"The app offered a fear and trauma quiz with 40 questions, which was very time-consuming. At the end, instead of displaying the results, it stated that I had to pay to see them. Why not inform users at the beginning, rather than wasting their time?"
1,184749291&&$,"This app is not designed to help. This app is designed to get you to subscribe to their service. Don‚Äôt bother trying the tests just to see how they go even if you‚Äôre curious about subscribing like I was, because you can‚Äôt even see the results without subscribing. Yikes."
5,Toofootforyou,"I love to challenge my brain. I absolutely love brain games, word and math puzzles too! Love this app"

4,it helps love me,It help me with so much stuff like problems it has games a lot not like a lot a lot like in the middle!
1,MUSIACIALLY LOVER,"I totally forgot about signing up for a trial & had no plan to actually subscribe beyond the trial. Unfortunately, I forgot about it and by the time I noticed the recurring WEEKLY charge of $6.99, they‚Äôd already gotten $35 that I didn‚Äôt plan to spend!"
4,Travioli was taken,I‚Äôve had it for 2 days and I can already feel my brain growling with productivity.

5,tshatsoff,I enjoy this and know it is helping strengthen my memory skills.
2,W-W19,After around level 50 don‚Äôt change in complexity after level 100 the puzzles just stop having answers all together.
3,Jerry_hr,"DONT PAY for this app - You will still have to watch ads   Had I known this , I wouldn‚Äôt have paid.  The games and puzzles are great , but I HATE WATCHING ADS even though I PAID"
1,MrsLgd,Deleting the app bc the ads are way too frequent and ridiculously long. They get stuck too and then I inadvertently end up clicking on them to try to get back to the app. Not worth it
5,memelovesu5,Keeping my brain sharp while having fun doing it!
5,NickD1423,Fun games but only playing 2 days so I don‚Äôt notice a difference yet
5,Jomo26X6816,Love this game super helpful in figuring some things out about yourself and staying brain active.
1,Lovinridgebacks,"My brain deteriorated more in the 10 min ads  between games than it improved by playing the games.  I have never had to watch ads for so long.  This is not a app, it‚Äôs an advertisement/brainwashing  with an occasional game you can play."
5,13zero13,Gets my mind going. Alerts me when I need a break.
5,jessxla,Love this app helps keep my brain feeling smart and helps me learn a lot about myself I love it

1,Sushiloverdbndks,They charged me a yearly subscription before my free trial was over :( the app is nothing but puzzle and silly games so disappointed. How ironic they manipulated me with the free trial and this app is supposed to ‚Äúhelp ur brain‚Äù also it doesn‚Äôt look nothing like the ad I saw on instagram
5,AugieStevens,This is a fun way to pass time while building your attention span.
5,NewtoMac95,A lot of fun plus I got 92 percent off for a year subscription so I can‚Äôt complain.

2,DarthZarall,"Says it increases brain function, but in all seriousness it constantly wants you to spend money to ‚Äúsee‚Äù your results.  It would say anything to you if you bought it.  There‚Äôs practically no ads, but it pops up after EVERY test, Buy Premium! Buy Premium!! Buy Premium!!!  Just be up front and honest, give a flat out price to buy the app.  Rather than bombard you with so called discounts but claim that your app is ‚Äúfree.‚Äù  It was fun until it was not."

1,pdak007,"I tried this app out and selected the free trial upon signing up. After signing up, I decided to cancel because I did not like the product. There was no way to cancel though.
