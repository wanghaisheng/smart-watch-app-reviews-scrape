5,dm10032,"I‚Äôve been using Bearable for about a month (after trying out some other trackers). I felt compelled to leave a review as I typically fall off the wagon with these kinds of things, but I‚Äôm consistently using this app after a month. I I can‚Äôt speak to what Bearable does or doesn‚Äôt do in comparison with others, because I never made it past the initial steps with the other apps and got frustrated with too many options and the general inflexibility (made me feel like I had to figure out exactly what I wanted to track right then and there when life just isn‚Äôt like that). Bearable has a ton of ways to customize that can seem overwhelming, but you can also initially hide those categories and track the most important stuff first and add in other factors and symptoms as time goes on.  I really like that it integrates with apple health and I really love that the developer is very open to feedback and sharing about features that are in the works. Integration with Fitbit would be great, but for now syncing my Fitbit info to apple health with FitSync is working absolutely fine. Bearable automatically grabs the info.  The trial period was SO helpful. Other apps have trial periods as well, but I cancelled them only days in after I‚Äôd had enough. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it‚Äôs yet to happen with this. Highly recommended."
5,amissie77e,"To start off with, this is the first app review that I have ever written - and I stopped using Bearable consistently probably a year ago, but occasionally it weighs on my heart to let others know my success story with Bearable. I had struggled with severe major depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (and still do, to a lesser extent) for close to a decade. I decided to invest in Bearable because anxiety had begun leaving me completely unable to function every single day ‚Äî like literally spent a week in bed just incessantly panicking. Cue setting up Bearable, painstakingly inputting every detail I could think of. I found after several months of use that many of the things that I thought were ‚Äúright‚Äù were actually leaving me in absolute wreckage, while my partner and his family were consistently bring my mood up SUBSTANTIALLY. Seeing the numbers laid out encouraged me to make the difficult decision of leaving what I now identify was a cult. It helped me cut ties with abusive situations that had trapped my family for generations. It helped me learn what joy was after years of hospital visits, SH episodes, panic attacks, and starvation. I am now living my best life and will look to Bearable again occasionally for answers to menial health concerns. This app changed my life and I would almost definitely not be here without it."
5,RiversideRunner,"I take a whole laundry list of meds that change frequently, and I just found out I'm autistic, and I have been battling major depression, PTSD, and anxiety for years. I also have chronic migraines from a severe head injury. Because of my autism, it's been difficult to communicate how I'm doing to my therapists and psychiatrists and doctors, and often I was not believed about the severity of my symptoms, or accused of not taking my medication, or told that my sleep or energy is better than I think it is. Now I have EMPIRICAL DATA all gathered in one place that provides an accurate assessment of my moods, symptoms both mental and physical, everything all in one place. My only complaint is that I wish you could time stamp EVERYTHING, not just medication times and mood and energy but also factors and symptoms instead of being limited to 4 time ranges because I'd like to see if a short-term intervention works and right now I can only see that I listen to relaxing music when I get anxious, but not whether I feel less anxious after listening to relaxing music. But this is the best app out there right now."
3,sweetnsour1826,"I have been using this app every day for 4 months now. It has been ok for keeping track of things (although I‚Äôd like to track my symptom onset time with more specificity than 6 hour blocks), but not great for insights. First of all, their correlations grid does not give correlation values, and while that probably doesn‚Äôt bother most people, the results and conclusions can be misleading. Also, the 6 hour blocks in which things are tracked make it impossible to discover / distinguish for example migraine symptoms vs. migraine warning signs vs. migraine triggers because I don‚Äôt know in what order they happened, just that they all happened in ‚ÄúMID‚Äù. The data will still be good for analyzing other larger daily patterns though, like whether my migraines are related to allergies. ~~ I finally downloaded all my data to analyze it myself, and discovered there‚Äôs no way to get *all* of your data because it doesn‚Äôt export when you marked a symptom as ‚Äúnone‚Äù (even they know that unmeasured is not the same as 0, which is why their ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù analysis page encourages you to mark symptoms as none when they‚Äôre not active instead of leaving them blank). I tried to ask about how to get all of my data using the ‚ÄúAsk support‚Äù button under FAQs, but the button doesn‚Äôt work. I tried to report this as a bug, but it turns out the ‚ÄúReport a bug‚Äù button doesn‚Äôt work either ü§£"
4,HdsAlli,"I have been looking for an app like this for AGES and imagine my surprise when an Instagram add pointed me towards one that actually works. This is what data should be for. It takes away so much stress for me that I don‚Äôt have to be the one trying to unpack what is leading to chronic pain flare ups, I can just be diligent about logging everything in and it would give me metrics.   This is such a helpful app I‚Äôd like to hope that maybe the creators would take some suggestions from people who have benefited from using it and add two features: a food log and the ability to enter periods of disrupted sleep. I‚Äôd like to see if there‚Äôs an association between WHAT I eat and how I feel and it would be really useful to be able to keep that in the same app. I‚Äôd also like to be able to indicate in the app if I was awake between 4am-5am, rather than only be able to list the total time from when I initially went to sleep to when I started my day, as I think that makes a huge difference in how I feel the next day.   Thank you for making an app that people with chronic pain actually need, for making it integrated with apple health, and for not forgetting about us menstruating folk out there."
5,Saruh2swag,"For a mood tracker I really like this app. It hard to get a habit out of it but that‚Äôs a me thing lol!! I like that it tracks your mood out of 1 - 10 scale because for me it‚Äôs easier to be honest with myself by picking a number than saying good or okay or bad (cause we are all normalized to saying ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm good‚Äù even if your not) I like that it tracks medication and when you take it I would use this but instead I text myself that I took my meds because that‚Äôs more automatic to me. Also the symptoms are a big thing!!! I enjoy that you can add different things to track, though I wish I gave you ideas because sometimes I want to track things similar to energy for example but I don‚Äôt know what I could put. They put an update it recently and I like it!! I looks more new and modern. The one thing I wish they had a better grip on is the design because I know I would be more encouraged to use it, it feels kinda bland if that makes sense :) that‚Äôs not a big deal whatsoever just a suggestion to make it even better! This is the best app I found for mood tracking the is compatible with how my brain works!!"
5,PunchedHercules,"I have been using this app on and off for about a year, but with the worsening of my symptoms, I am back on the wagon and I‚Äôm not coming off. I forgot how incredibly helpful it is. To give a bit of a background, I am a college student with classical EDS (diagnosed when I was very little, so it‚Äôs not new to me) and POTS, amongst other issues. I focus on my productivity and achievements so much that I neglect my health sometimes, and I want to fix that. My favorite thing about this app is logging my symptoms every day as well as what I eat and other factors such as sleep and weather, and every week it will show a report of correlations and I can adjust accordingly. It is nice to be able to have this data to show my doctors as well.  I also love that on their subreddit they always ask how new features would work and they listen so well to their app users. Please give this app a try, the developers clearly work so hard and put out a great tool for us. Thank you so much!! ‚ú®"
4,Pepsico_15,"What you are looking for in a tracker of any kind is for it to be as effortless as possible, meaning taking data from various sources and making sense of it without you having to add data manually.  That‚Äôs what we like about the Apple Watch for instance it is capturing so much data just being on your wrist.  The problem is when applications capture the same set of data, do it manually, and don‚Äôt collaborate. So as an IOS user I have updated my mood status (sporadically, because there are things happening in your life distracting you from updating an app) and now this application is asking me to do the same, on different metrics‚Ä¶ why can‚Äôt bearable use Apple health data or the other way around. Given this is one of the core value of the app, correlating events to moods you end up having scattered data which is not exploited.  I also have an app Welltory that captures biometrically my energy level but I have to enter it manually here.  So not a problem of the app per say but just lack of data integration. All these apps should work together to better collaborate!"
3,Apostate_Mage,"This app works really good and I wanted to love it especially with having paid for premium, but unfortunately a large amount of the symptoms I face are related to food. While I can customize the app for things like ‚Äòhigh sugar‚Äô etc, in my case this doesn‚Äôt help because I can‚Äôt discern any pattern in the foods that make me ill and being able to look at all the ingredients as patterns is essential. There just isn‚Äôt an easy way to do this and manually entering each ingredient is too time consuming to realistically do every meal. This is a huge factor and if I need to use another app like lifesum or myfitnesspal to track food it largely defeats the purpose of this app since I have to manually compare anyways-I‚Äôll for now just stick to sticky notes :/ Which is a bummer because I really really want an app that is all in one for symptoms or food-all the apps I‚Äôve found seem to be only one or the other.   For now I‚Äôve stopped using it for those reasons.  Overall though I can say I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who is struggling with health issues unrelated to food. It works amazing for that."
5,Janet Straper (from the US),"I‚Äôm only a few days into this tracker but I have used others in the past. This tracker lets you get super granular‚Äîimportant if you are trying to sort out nebulous symptoms a variety of maladies. The interface was overwhelming at first, but once it was set up it is very intuitive. Other apps have been hard to get in the habit of using but capturing my day in these bite sized chunks has become a *fun* thing. Plus I‚Äôm motivated to log so my data doesn‚Äôt look junky!   I love that I can add notes to basically every input and that the search feature calls up all the instances of that word. After appointments I write a few words to recap/reflect and I foresee this being an exceptionally useful feature for follow up appointment.   The team seems to have a lot of features coming down the pipeline and I would love to see this app grow. With the small team, I suspect that updates may lag but the app is fully functional now. The privacy policy is good‚Äîgreat would be a complete local (server or other backup optional) like Daylio."
5,catsandolives,"I've never written an app review before because I'm never consistent enough when using apps. It's been over 6  months of using Bearable and it's everything I've always wanted in a health tracking app. I've used several health tracking, todo, mood tracking apps and this has by far exceeded all my expectations.  I love how customizable and flexible it is! Many apps don't even allow you to add your own tags. I also love how simple the app is, no frills. Design wise ‚Äì it's so easy to grok and read. The colors are just right and not overwhelming. Even though there's a ton of things going on in this app, it's easy to navigate.   Love that it syncs to Apple health. I'm able to also connect other data (e.g. Oura data) from Apple Health to Bearable so I have all my health metrics in one place.  I use this mainly to track factors/medication affecting my anxiety/depression but it's also become a habit tracker! I love that I can use the calendar view to see how many days I've done a certain ""factor"" or action. Doing this daily also just helps me be present and reflect on my day in a quick and accesible way!   The insights are not as helpful for me but I'd say that about any health tracking app ‚Äì the obvious things are always true (exercise, eat well, get sun, sleep well, etc) but it's nice to see the trends over time in case you're going through some big life changes.  Thank you so much for creating this app. Seriously!!!"
5,sunnibebe,"I have tried a lot of different methods for tracking symptoms. But this one takes the cake. Before hand, sitting down and writing it every day wasn‚Äôt easy especially on heavy fatigue/drowsiness days. This app has quickly become a favorite of mine. It took a little bit to explore all the features but I‚Äôve finally got the hang of it. I‚Äôve tried apps, planners, and the like for so long. None of them were up to par with my needs except this one. I got the premium version and I can say it is actually worth it.   Being able to visually see my symptoms fluctuate and understand how they‚Äôre affected by certain things is such a big plus. The nutrition tracking ability is also great because it‚Äôs simple & not calorie based. I can tag it as a heavy fruit veggie day Vs not.   As someone with interest in app development, UI/UX design, etc : good job! The app is fairly easy to navigate, things are clear, and the layout works. Whoever is behind building this app deserves every dollar they make. I know how difficult these features and the like can be to put together. So kudos.  Onto things I could see being added / enjoy : - urination tracker ; some of us pee a whole lot and it could be useful for doctor appointments.   That‚Äôs all the feedback I have for now. Honestly I have major gratitude for the people that put this together. I wanted to build something similar but never managed to due to getting sick on and off."
3,n0niknm,"Cute mascot. Despite a lengthy privacy policy assuring you they aren't doing anything shady, at the very bottom it tells you that they're giving your email address to Facebook and Google to ""find more customers like you"", so be sure to sign up with Apple and use the ""hide email"" feature.  The onboarding is well-intentioned but annoying (far too long due to an unnecessary, unskippable ""customization"" questionnaire). It can supposedly import data like heart rate from Health but it's not in there by default, does not ask during onboarding, and how to sync it is unclear. The UI is visually attractive but not intuitive, and it needs a lot of work on the usability front-- for example, you cannot close the 'choose the main symptoms you want to track' window without closing the entire app. It's also one of those """"""free"""""" apps that are actually unusable after the subscription trial period, because the entire insights tab is paywalled.  All of that said, it's the only app I could find that's trying to do what it's doing, and it deserves credit for that and the cute visual design."
5,rowanrooks,"This app is great because it is so customizable. It did require some setup time to go through each widget and create factors to track my specific health concerns, but the initial time investment was well worth it. I have the ability to remove stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter to me, and create some oddly specific categories that I doubt I could find anywhere else.  It also helps to have everything in one place. I have memory problems, but I need to track a few different symptoms, medications taken, medication side effects, sleep logging, digestive health, and a food journal. It is hard to keep up with all of that, but this app has widgets to log all of these things and more.  There are sections to track daily factors, stress, energy levels, mood, mental health, weather, menstruation, extra notes, and more. It can be as simple or as detailed as you want to make it. Bearable is also synced with my iOS health app, so it automatically logs sleep, heart rate, and step count measurements from my Apple watch.  Most importantly, I can see that the developers are listening to user feedback and constantly working on improving this app. I have suggested and voted on others‚Äô suggestions for new features that I would like to see implemented. It is awesome that they are really involved with the community, and I‚Äôm interested to see what they come up with next."
2,Rayla495,"I've struggled with a variety of illness' and symptoms since I was a child. Before Bearable trying to keep track of everything was always difficult and I found myself getting lost in symptoms.  I've tried other symptom logging apps but they were either too open ended or too rigid on what the symptoms and intensity should be and neither matched up to what I needed. Normally I have trouble sticking with things but I got the email today that i'm 30 days on bearable, right after logging my symptoms into the app!  Im very grateful for bearable because now all of that chaos is behind me. I can easily log my symptoms, nutrition, water, sleep and more with a few pushes of buttons. I love how customizable the app is, you can add or take away common symptoms and rate the severity of discomfort.  I also appreciate how the data is organized that's collected, I can easily see what my symptoms have been for each category organized by date. This has greatly helped with doctors appointments and remembering exactly when symptoms began or were difficult, intensity, and other factors from that time."
5,ScottieBoiJoe,"Almost immediately signed up for premium when I got it because of how much I love this tracker (and it was much more affordable then other trackers). I like the app because it‚Äôs so customizable and gives me solid data about what is effecting my mood the day of, day after, week after, etc. of behaviors. You also might learn how some meds might effect your mood (but sometimes this is coincidental so always check with a doc first!) that you didn‚Äôt know even effected you before. Sometimes when I get bored and have nothing to do I go in and do a little mood check in (I try to do it at least twice a day but usually end up doing like five+ a day). Compared to other trackers this one sets the bar super high imo and I would highly recommend it. Bear in mind (pun intended) that insights won‚Äôt be as accurate but it‚Äôll even out about a month in."
4,Booberrox392,"This app is a great way to keep track of my moods. It‚Äôs a person who struggles with ADHD, depression and anxiety, I often have mood fluctuations and have no idea how to gain perspective on the issue. This app allows me to stay in touch with the bigger picture which helps me feel grounded. I really love how many different points of data that you are able to add to this app. It is so convenient and satisfying to sync my sleep tracking app with this app so I can see how my sleep relates to my mood. Seeing how seamless this integration is makes me really really want to have more of my Apple health data sync with this app. I have an Apple Watch and constantly am curious of how things like my steps and exercise minutes factor into my mood. I feel that this integration would be so simple to include and would make this app a lot more robust.   I also want to encourage the developers of this app to make an Apple Watch version so I can quickly input my mood on my watch. I have wanted to do this on countless different occasions because it would be such an easy way to input the data, but have to wait until I can pull my phone out instead.   Overall, excellent app that simply tracks so many different things, but it‚Äôs only limited by the number of automatically synced integrations. If this app could sync with my Apple health data with more detail, I would give this five stars."
5,ohitsmandi,I am in love with this app. I have tried so many other ones and prior to this was using a handful at once to try and gather all the data I wanted. I have a severe unique case of bipolar disorder and although I am new to the app I already know I will be able to gain some useful information and find some patterns so I will better be able to relay them to my doctors.   I am grateful for the interface being so user friendly and easy so that even on my bad days I am still able to track the bare minimum and not be overwhelmed. I feel like this app is an answer to my prayers. I know this app is on the newer side so I am very excited to see what new features and such are added.   Thank you so so much for providing this app and thank you for making it at such an affordable price for the premium. I will definitely be recommending this to everyone at my clinics.  üôèüèº
5,SilverSparrow888,"I‚Äôm new to Bearable and have used it for one week. While I love bio-hacking as a concept, I have had difficulty tracking symptoms due to increasing health anxiety as I age.   The older I get, the worse I feel physically, which in turn impacts my emotional wellbeing. It‚Äôs been difficult to face these challenges alone and I was pretty resistant to using Bearable when I first began because it has SO many metrics to keep track of.   While this is a plus of the app, I was concerned it would be too overwhelming for me to learn. Fortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case.   So far I‚Äôve found it very easy to use and I truly appreciate the levels of tracking (low detail, medium detail, and high detail). This ‚Äúlow bar"" to entry and the helpful tips built into the app helped me overcome anxiety and avoidance as I endeavor to improve my overall health.   Easy, not stressful to use, and I can start slow and build up to tracking more details at my own pace. üëç  I also liked the well written privacy policy. It is difficult to know which apps to trust with my private health information, but after reading through their privacy policies I feel reassured that Bearable is trustworthy.  I feel more empowered to take care of my health each time I check in with the app. Thank you Bearable team!"
5,Weedelwoo,"I‚Äôve NEVER been a person to continue using health apps after a few days but this one is just so good. I had been only really using my notes app continuously to track symptoms, but this app makes it so much easier and allows me to be much more thorough. It‚Äôs completely customizable which is awesome, especially as someone with multiple health issues/ figuring out health issues and needs to track things for doctors. It also helps me to acknowledge how prevalent each of my symptoms actually are which can be important when you‚Äôve dealt with issues for a long time and start to brush things off because you‚Äôre so used to them. I do wish the extra notes part were included in the free version, but not a big deal. Would 100% recommend!!"
5,chronicallycraftin,"For years I have tried to track various of my chronic health issues using day planners or apps basically developed for healthy people to track exercise and diet, in order to better relay what I was experiencing to my numerous doctors and therapists, but they all fell short in giving a full picture of my daily struggles. Not only is this app already so helpful, the developer is still tweaking it and regularly updating it to be even more in depth and able to suit all the various kinds of health conditions! If you happen to use Reddit, you can even join the group he created JUST FOR FEEDBACK FROM USERS! So that you can speak directly to him about ANY issues youre facing and he will personally walk you through any tech support (in his app)   100% recommend to anyone with chronic health concerns"
5,Rishabh9508,This app is a must. It has all the features and customizations needed to track every aspect of your health from mental to physical to emotional. It can give you insights on how ever small decision of your day can affect even the smallest aspect of your life. And the best part is that it is all free. Yes you can pay extra for them to do all the cross data analysis but you can figure it out on your own. The main thing is tracking and that is all free. Cannot go wrong with this app and I love the overall thought put into the design and feels like the people who built this app genuinely care that people are able to discover hidden things about their health and not just forcing an app out to make money.   Can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. I wish everyone uses it.
5,nikkay27,"I have ADHD, Anxiety, and two different chronic illnesses and this tracker is so helpful in tracking all the different types of symptoms I experience.   My favorite feature is the mood tracker which lets you track your mood throughout the day and then averages it. You also can write a little explanation about your mood - which if you‚Äôre like me with not the best memory it‚Äôs so nice to be able to go back and see those entries. It also helps me realize that setbacks I face throughout my day (and would ordinarily obsess about) are just little blips.  I can see that despite my panic attack the day is still good, it hasn‚Äôt been completely ruined. It‚Äôs been very helpful for me to have something visualizes that so well.   I definitely recommend this app for anyone with chronic pain or any kind of mental illness or mood disorder."
5,FormerWonk,"Since I was diagnosed a year ago, I've been using this app. It has helped me to distinguish between the symptoms of my condition and the side effects of the powerful drugs I take to treat it. For example, the app syncs with Apple Health so I can see patterns between my symptoms, the meds, and how well I sleep. I use it at the end of the day to rate them and then the app analyzes and reports weekly on what factors most affect my mood, symptoms and sleep. I especially appreciate the new Self discoveries section where I can reflect on what improves or triggers my symptoms, all supported with ""hints"" of correlations and trends from the data I have recorded. This app has helped me learn what affects my condition and gain a sense of agency to live well with it. Thanks Bearable devs!"
5,elikqitie,"I‚Äôve tried a couple of apps that tracked symptoms but only the ones that came with the app and the list of symptoms wasn‚Äôt as comprehensive. Other apps also don‚Äôt have lifestyle tracking, events, and a way to customize your tracking in six hour time intervals which is great for making health correlations. I like the customization, and especially the ability to choose which metrics to compare so you can make relevant assumptions about what activities you‚Äôre doing that are impacting your health the most. I‚Äôve had some new symptoms come up lately and I‚Äôm hoping that tracking these symptoms and giving the report to my doctors will be very useful in getting an accurate diagnosis."
5,claraj0rdan,"I‚Äôve used a lot of different health trackers in an attempt to get a better grip on my complex chronic illness. The problem with most apps and methods is they either lack the ability to customize the app to my specific needs or they require way too many spoons to use. Bearable is not like any other health tracker.   I have 14 doses of meds per day and a litany of symptoms, triggers, and environmental factors that I need to track everyday. Bearable let‚Äôs me do that! Not only can I totally customize what I actually track but it takes less than 5 minutes to record everything I need to.   Now when my doctors or medical practitioners ask about my medication adherence or symptom/trigger management I‚Äôm able to answer definitively. It‚Äôs also very helpful to be able to add major events and daily notes because brain fog will often make me completely forget when something impactful happened or what weird symptom I wanted to ask my doc about.  Overall, I cannot recommend Bearable enough. Especially if you have complex chronic illness and/or are disabled. EDS, POTS, MCAS, and etcetera are extremely difficult conditions to manage but Bearable makes it so much easier."
5,shoujoglitter,"this app is super helpful for tracking symptom levels as well as energy and mood, as well as figuring out things that improve or worsen those things. this on its own would already be five stars, but i‚Äôm also in the bearable discord server and the staff there is incredibly responsive when it comes to user questions and ideas. they put a lot of effort into understanding what their users want and need, which can‚Äôt be said for a lot of apps. i actually pay for the premium membership and i am typically very hesitant to spend ANY money on apps, so hopefully that‚Äôs a glowing enough review for it. the app handles the basics just fine without premium, but the paid insights are both useful and super interesting to look at."
1,ElleBlue3,"I was excited to find an app where I can customize my psychological and physical symptoms so I tried it today. I go into Mood, select my happiness level, go to the screen with mood descriptions, scroll to the bottom, select Edit, I can turn on and off different descriptions. However, when I edit either a new ‚Äúcustom‚Äù description OR a pre-existing one, approve the change and return to the description on/off screen, if I select a second description to change, I get the ‚Äúadd mood‚Äù full screen and I cannot edit. If I try to add a description from that full screen ‚Äúadd,‚Äù I get a completely white screen that crashes.   So to edit more than one mood description, I have to change one, quit the app, restart it, and do a second one. It‚Äôs a highly frustrating bug especially for a paid app!  Also I should be able to delete descriptions (not just turn them off) to make the edit screen easier to navigate. Lastly, you need an iPad app!"
5,Lovanmusiq,"I rarely write reviews for apps, but felt like I needed to knowing this app could help someone feel more empowered in their health journey. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and I used this app to begin tracking my symptoms I was experiencing to help communicate to my doctors how serious of a problem this was for me. Now after getting the diagnosis, I‚Äôve been using it to help my brain see my health as a priority. The data and insights I get from it also helps me to stop living in autopilot and be more intentional about the decisions I‚Äôm making for my health. I wish I could say more, but at this point just get the app and try it for yourself. Even without the premium account, it was VERY helpful. Wishing you all the best on your health journey. üôèüèΩ"
5,Stella J M.,"After a visit to ER I was asked by my Neurologist to keep track of my symptoms. I found Bearable from an AD on social media- and thought I‚Äôd try it. It hasn‚Äôt ever been this easy to keep track of symptoms/pains, daily activities, nutrition, and moods ALL IN ONE PLACE. I‚Äôm able to track when I see what doctor, when I get tests done, when I take what med and how much. As well as what symptoms/pains come up and what I was doing around that time.  It helps me keep track so when I see my specialist, I am able to reflect and give them an accurate timeline. Able to answer their questions confidently and in depth. I only have access to the free version- and honestly it‚Äôs all I need.  Absolutely thrilled to have this app!!!"
5,galefacekillah,"I NEVER review apps, ever. But I downloaded this app last week and have been LOVING it. So far it has met all of my needs and I have yet to identify a feature it is lacking. I am incredibly ADHD and horrible at creating new habits, but there is such a dopamine hit in logging my daily symptoms / factors that it hasn‚Äôt been hard for me to keep up with it at all. Also, they make logging things SO easy. I love that there is a Reddit community where the product developers appear to actively be engaging with users, addressing concerns and sharing new features. This is an example of technology being used for good. I am really excited to keep using this app and very happy I found it. I‚Äôd give it 10 stars if I could."
5,Beckanator90,"This app really is amazing. The ability to track EVERYTHING down to the smallest detail, and see INSTANT reporting to make sense of trends? I mean, it‚Äôs the dream of someone with chronic illness. I‚Äôm a cancer patient and I have been looking for something like this app for a long time. This has really helped me and my doctors to make critical decisions about my care. I love that it also includes non-medical tracking as well (e.g mood, habits, major life events, meditation and sleep). I can track my daily meds, mood, sleep, and symptoms all in the same app! The only negative would be that it is SO detailed, and there‚Äôs SO much you can do, it can sometimes be overwhelming, which can deter you from following the regime."
5,leahenoch1,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a couple weeks now to try to get a grip on my chronic symptoms and what factors could be causing them. Originally, I was thinking of trying to find an app that could do everything for free, but because of how well this one works I actually am considering paying for a year subscription(which is saying something). It‚Äôs very quick to enter all of your data and it covers so many different metrics in a really user-friendly way that doesn‚Äôt take up too much of my time or stress me out. It gives you some analysis for free, but it seems reasonable to me considering everything that they track to pay for those extra insights long-term."
5,Nicca_90,You can customize it and it was a affordable price for the year what I‚Äôve seen some symptom trackers charge for a month.   The customization and affordability and having everything in one place and it connects to your health apps.  This app was beautifully designed and I hope they keep the price the same or lower to make it more accessible for more people who could benefit from it.  Also being able to use on my computer as well would be nice!  I love that you offer a week trial before getting charged.  I kept it after the week I love it so much.  Highly recommend. It can help you notice trends so you can help yourself
5,grA.V,"This is a near-perfect user interface & customizability. They have a few things they can improve but still the best out there.   One trick though if you‚Äôre using two devices, which I learned the hard way. If you started on your phone and try switching to an iPad/tablet, you‚Äôll get a warning message to logout on the other device. YOU MUST LOG OUT OF THE OTHER DEVICE WHEN THAT ERROR MESSAGE IS SHOWING. Don‚Äôt click OK and logout later; and weirdly, don‚Äôt log out EARLY before trying to log in on the new device. Somehow, that error message makes the data sync possible. If you log out of the first device before or after the error screen shows, you‚Äôll lose your work. Great app though!"
4,CaliRya,"I‚Äôve been using this app a few months now and it‚Äôs amazing. The comprehensive list of handy features makes me not need to look any further for symptom tracking. It works really well too. I have yet to encounter a bug or app crashing. As far as privacy goes, I appreciate the promise not to sell users‚Äô personal information, because data in this app is especially sensitive. So that‚Äôs reassuring. I do see room for improvement with privacy and security, though. First, I don‚Äôt see any mention of end-to-end encryption, which I‚Äôd prefer. Second, I‚Äôd like zero user tracking/profiling using device ID or email address. Thankfully, at least there seems like a way to opt out of device ID tracking."
5,knitgnat,"I am a picky app user and it takes maybe 10 minutes of exploring and I know whether I will use it or not - most get deleted.  The evening I downloaded Bearable, I found it easy to dive into which I did enthusiastically!  So relieved to have somewhere to document and track these myriad symptoms! No more carrying them in my scared and confused brain!  Such a relief.  I am a newbie, beginning to learn about trends & what affects my health.  The developer emailed contact info inviting questions I may have! I just might! Yet the app is user friendly, being intuitive, so further exploration on my part may remedy possible questions.  I wondered, who developed this excellent tool? Someone who also experiences the scary and mysteriously baffling world of Autoimmune Disease.  From the bottom of my heart, Thank you for reaching beyond illness to share with others this tool you initially created for yourself.     This app has given me the first experience of having some measure of control and understanding  over my definitely but not specific diagnosis (so frustrating!)  I am not alone."
5,ereneyh1125,"This is by far the best symptom tracker I have ever found, and I have been using it for several years. I originally was looking for a way to track chronic pain/headaches, but could only find migraine apps and I didn‚Äôt have common triggers. I love that this app is customizable to each user, and you can track specifically for you! I also love the calendar feature that shows how many days out of the month you experience specific symptoms, and the notes section available under each symptom.   Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this app, especially if you have less common or undiagnosed issues."
5,caringiscoool,"I‚Äôm fairly new to a complicated chronic illness and learning how to manage it has been really confusing and hard.   It‚Äôs so hard to know what unexpected factors might be exacerbating problems, and the stakes feel really high for drawing connections as fast as possible to avoid further damage.   I really wanted a way to track EVERYTHING, like every small bit of data I could, to see if sense could be made of it, and was thinking it would be nice if there was an app for it but didn‚Äôt feel hopeful about finding something as comprehensive as I was dreaming of.  So I have been delighted over and over again with how comprehensively Bearable has already solved this problem! The fact that it was made by someone with a chronic illness really shows, because this is so thorough and so easy to modify. I‚Äôm just using the free version and it‚Äôs blowing my mind, I can‚Äôt even imagine how much MORE comprehensive it gets with the premium upgrade!  Highly recommended. It‚Äôs really great and exactly what I wanted and more."
5,Clinketty,"I have been struggling to keep track of my complicated and evolving health issues for over a year. Then I found Bearable and my tracking headaches have been eliminated completely!   This app is very detailed, which helps me because my health issues can sometimes be very subtle. They also have been evolving over time, and Bearable is able to keep up with all of that. It also allows for customization, which helps me make the app fit *me,* as opposed to me having to fit the app.   The free version of this app offers A LOT, as well. Very generous of them. I‚Äôm glad I finally upgraded to Premium, but if you are unsure or on a tight budget, you can still track a ton of things with the free version.   I am not a tech-minded person, so I appreciate how well thought out the design of this app is. I was able to get going quickly. Everything is very user-friendly. Also, I recently hit a glitch that turned out to stem from Apple, but when I first reached out to Bearable, they answered quickly.   This app is simply fabulous."
5,DomesticGoddess27,"The customization of this app is exactly what I wanted. I can track weight loss, medication, my period, and chronic health problems all together. Took a while to set up how I like. Then as I used it a tweaked it here and there.    Being able to use the insights graph to see how all the different things I track affect each other has been better insight than I thought. I was able to see that days I fold laundry my tennis elbow was more painful. Switch a chore with hubby and way less elbow pain for me.   The free trial gave me a good test drive and I decided to keep the app. The price is good considering there is a subreddit that the developer is active on."
3,Cassuhdeeee,"I downloaded this earlier this week and really thought it was a great idea, and figured the annual membership was affordable compared to other apps. But sadly the app won‚Äôt sync to Apple health, and I really wished it synced with a nutrition app like my fitness pal, especially because I‚Äôm in the process of trying to figure out food sensitivities. I‚Äôve tried all the tricks like disconnecting and resynching and uninstalling.   I‚Äôve had a lot of issues with how Apple health is designed and what it does and doesn‚Äôt include. Was hoping bearable could bridge that gap, but seems like I‚Äôm out of luck.   I still plan on using it, since it‚Äôs still the best option out there, and it‚Äôs good at what it does do! I love how customizable the symptom trackers are!"
5,dkpants,"I had been looking for a way to track my health in detail but also have it feel manageable. Another reviewer said eloquently that they liked how you could start simple and then add more detail & customization as you go, and that‚Äôs exactly what I did. It allowed me to start small and get to know the app before expanding. I really love the format, it feels user friendly and also has been easy to remember to follow through with tracking data every day since i started. I don‚Äôt usually stick with things consistently but so far this one has me creating better routines, so I‚Äôm thrilled. üåü"
5,Little Mochi39,"Bearable is one of the few apps I deem worthy of a subscription. The app is genuinely amazing. The health data is stored privately, It‚Äôs very customizable, and they‚Äôre transparent with what features they‚Äôre working on adding, considering adding, and aren‚Äôt adding. I use it to keep track of the medications I take, it makes it so much easier to remember when I‚Äôve taken what, and at the exact time I‚Äôve taken it. It‚Äôs super easy to log symptoms too if you want to keep track of your symptom‚Äôs severity, and can add custom symptoms too. Does it do absolutely everything? No. But does it do amazingly at the other things? YES! I love the app."
5,Shan-Trouble,"Being diagnosed last March with RA, OA and Fibromyalgia my life went completely upside down and I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on with my body AND my mind/brain! I started writing every down but that was complete agony on my fingers and shoulders so I had to quit. Well scrolling on FB I saw a Reel for this app so I checked into and and downloaded it (one day I pray I can pay for 1 year premium!!!!!) this app is a life changer for ppl with chronic pain and 3 autoimmune diseases and getting worse! TRUST ME YOU WANT THIS APP! My pain management Dr was happy to hear of this app and that I have it! I have told others of it and they thank me!!!!"
5,A young Chesterton fan,"I am trying to track a variety of symptoms for a couple health issues, including some very idiosyncratic symptoms you don‚Äôt find on apps tailored for specific health issues. This app is EXACTLY what I was looking for‚Äîcustomizable, with usable data for my doctors to see. AND you can track severity, time, custom notes (if you get the subscription), mood, medication (seriously, app in one app!) and so much more. I love that it has so much functionality but also seems to be continuing to grow. They just released symptom grouping which is an awesome feature that makes sorting between, say, allergy symptoms and migraine symptoms, even easier to navigate. Great app!"
5,katie3479,"I‚Äôve had this app and been paying for it since 2021 and it‚Äôs been increasingly one of the best things i pay for (and it helps they aren‚Äôt greedy and have options to help you pay if you need it!!). It‚Äôs really a game changer, they have options to view insights and log habits of literally everything you can think of including sleep, mood, activity, screen time, socialization, energy levels, and so much more. It‚Äôs been so important as someone who struggles with fatigue and sleep to try to see if any factors might play in or if any particular days or times are worse. You will love this app"
5,love<3!,"I‚Äôve been using bearable for about 3 months and it‚Äôs helped a lot, the notification help remind me to take my meds, the symptoms charts help me keep accurate information for my doctors, and the section to put in my blood pressure helped a ton to help prove to my doctor that my hypertension was still not well managed and get me the proper meds I needed. On top of this my fianc√© who doesn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt any physical disabilities uses it as well and finds it helpful to keep track of her mood, eating disorder recovery, and just overall general health. Definitely recommend for anyone looking to keep track of health habits"
5,MomOfOneAndDone,For starters I rarely if ever review apps - but this one is a life saver for me! I just downloaded this app. Paid for the premium subscription. I‚Äôve been advocating for my health for the past 5 years and FINALLY getting the answers. I love how this is tracking everything for me. And that I can edit and add additional tracking needs! I can stop with the multipliable apps and just use one. I‚Äôm only on day 2 and I‚Äôm already in love! Thank you for coming up with an awesome app for those of us who are suffering with invisible illnesses! It‚Äôs a battle and a fight and having trackers help with advocating for the care we need!
5,howmuchmorethen,"I have been using this app since 2020 and I feel that it has helped me to become more self-aware about my feelings and symptoms. I track my depression symptoms and I can also note the weather, my monthly cycle, nutrition factors, and anything else that may be relevant. I looked at other tracker apps and this one is definitely the complete package as far as being able to do track a wide range of different symptoms.   This app is totally customizable and I recommend it for anyone that has a mental health issue or complex physical health issue that they need to manage.  Thank you!"
5,CorvetteTaylor,"I have had the honor of using this app since they first launched it, before the paid subscription. It has been worth every penny and so much more. The developers are always listening and making it better and better. I honestly can‚Äôt think of any negative issues  I have ever had with the app. I have chronic conditions and it helped my doctors finally diagnose an autoimmune disease. I have been able to manage symptoms and navigate away from certain conditions that makes it worse. This has changed my life. It is awesome. This app is a lifesaver. Everyone should use it."
5,Il'ragazza,"I had been looking for a simple app to track several things, including health symptoms and factor, mood changes, and variations of mental health symptoms on a daily basis. This was the simplest one I found that didn‚Äôt complicate anything AND it‚Äôs free. I want to try the premium but haven‚Äôt done so yet. It even gives you a place to write a journal entry or comments on each thing and the entire thing is highly customizable for your own personal preferences. Highly beneficial for self-awareness practices and those that have chronic illnesses or in need of sharing information with doctors and healthcare teams."
5,Zoejth,"I have been looking for a good app to track my mental health and/or physical health for years. I never for a second thought there would be an app like Bearable, where I can literally track it all. I like that you can also enter your symptoms and mood more than once a day, as I‚Äîsomeone with both chronic pain/illness and chronic mental health issues‚Äîdefinitely get fluctuating symptoms. I like the correlations it offers (I‚Äôm a data nerd, what can I say?) and it‚Äôs helped me be more mindful of certain triggers. Overall? Best app I‚Äôve used for tracking my symptoms EVER!"
5,KittyKate1994,So I have used just about every tracking app you can imagine and this is hands down the the first that was worth the trouble of getting it set up. I‚Äôm a nurse and use the FAM so I have a lot of experience tracking health data and this is the best symptom tracker I‚Äôve ever tried. The only thing I would suggest adding is basic basically body temperature tracking features. It should be easy to add since you already have a way to track temperature (and Apple Watch and Ora integration which is a must for getting meaningful temperature data).
5,blargyish,"I found this app through a post on r/dataisbeautiful and honestly I cannot be more grateful for my procrastination this one time. I've tried a lot of health tracking apps but as someone who basically has issues across the map it was a pain having multiple apps to track different things, all with different limits on free users. Now I have one app to remember all of my problems instead of me forgetting and panicking when a ""new"" issue arises. This is kind of a depressing review but I feel like this app will help me get back on the right track!"
5,Lady Sher Bear,"I VERY seldom pay for upgrades on apps or write reviews. This app is amazing for me. I am able to track everything I need to in one app. It is so customizable free that it‚Äôs not necessary for simple tracking.  When the tracking becomes cumbersome I get overwhelmed and stop. Now  that I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 days I AM paying for the annual premium upgrade because tracking with details is SO easy that I am looking forward to doing it. I believe I have found that golden nugget; a supportive and empowering tool to manage the chronic pain and mental health challenges I am experiencing. Thank you, thank you for this app!"
5,fajahtaha,"Convenient, easy to use. I used to track all of this stuff on a bunch of separate apps, but now I can do it all in one place! I use it to track medication, water intake, and mood. It‚Äôs very flexible and customizable, so I also use it as a checklist for my chores, self-care, and habits I‚Äôm trying to establish. There‚Äôs even more that it‚Äôs built to help with though! I intend to incorporate the food diary and sleep tracking in as I get back in control of my life. This app makes it so simple and enjoyable to see how I‚Äôm doing and how I can improve. It is a literal lifesaver and I can not recommend it enough. Thank you for creating this app!"
5,ohheycelia,"As someone who struggles with mental illness, this app helps me to be self aware of what i‚Äôm feeling and why I might be feeling it. I can use this in therapy so easily which is incredibly helpful and productive for me. I used to journal to keep track of some of this stuff, but having all of it right here on my phone and so clearly laid out is a lifesaver.   The premium features are really intuitive and it‚Äôs interesting to be able to look at the trends so that I can actively make lifestyle changes when necessary.   I‚Äôd highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a customizable app for tracking physical and mental health symptoms!"
4,drtijr,"I really love this app and how you can customize it. I have an Auto-immune disease and this allows me to track my meds, how I feel throughout the day, BP and pulse and more. The only complaint I have is that with the symptom tracker.  the the 6 hour intervals being customizable instead of the set  6am, 12 pm, 6pm, 12am‚Ä¶. I am only end up using 2 of the 6. I'm not up at 6am or awake at 12am (normally). I know its a range but when you are trying to be specific, it would be nice to make your own intervals that relate to you personally.  I don't seem to be the only one frustrated with this, so maybe they will add this in a future up-date. ü§û"
5,Janie1329,"This app has a lot of potential! I‚Äôm able to log so much of my medical info and physical and mental health all in one place. The UI/UX is pretty intuitive (though definitely took me a couple days to get used to everything) and simple. Another plus is the developers are transparent about the development work, which you can view via their Roadmap link. Despite the app having a subscription system, the annual fee is VERY reasonable unlike other health journaling apps. I‚Äôm a big fan so far and look forward to seeing how the app develops!!!"
5,BirdGirlinTn,"This is a fantastic app that is easy to use and customize for people trying to sort out how various factors affect the way they feel. Track your sleep habits, diet, physical activity, stress, medicines and supplements, and more‚Äîand Bearable builds graphics to show correlations between those factors and various outcomes, like mood, energy levels, body measurements, and whatever symptoms you decide to track.  Great for people with complex or chronic illness, athletes looking to optimize performance, or people just  interested in keeping better tabs on all the variables playing into their health."
5,coolliz21,"Bearable was the sixth health tracking app I tried, and it was simple enough to utilize effectively from the very start. I really like how customizable everything is, and that I‚Äôll be able to use the data I input later to find correlations between how I feel and what could be affecting me. After 9 days of extensive use, the app hasn‚Äôt crashed once! I will DEFINITELY be upgrading to premium soon, as it is extremely affordable for a year (at least with the early subscriber discount), but there are plenty of features available for free that easily make this a worthwhile app."
5,witchyeitch,"It‚Äôs very seamless and the best part is that it lets me edit everything, write-in your specific symptoms so there‚Äôs no limit. It lets me type in little notes for specific symptoms and it just feels very organized and not overbearing. Thank you I‚Äôve been looking for this exact thing in all the health apps and could never find it. Great job to the developers, this will help me track my health better and I love it even after only using it for a few hours. The only thing is I don‚Äôt know how to change the times to a 12hr clock, everything else is perfect."
5,Smurf_,"I have been having medical challenges more and more the past few years, and bouncing between doctors and diagnoses has been hard. It can be overwhelming to try and keep track of the things that might be relevant and might not -- and even more so to remember when those symptoms happened. This app is great because it covers so many different factors that make up your medical, mental, and physical health. I just started using it, but it's such a relief. I hope they do more integrations with Apple Health and possibly MyFitnessPal!"
3,tucker bear,"This app had a lot of promise. However, there is zero customization for exporting data. I am only able to export data organized by day. Because I cannot break it down by category to export, i.e. sleep or bowels it looses it‚Äôs usefulness. It also misses out on being a useful tool I can share with my doctor, who may want to see a trend. In addition for the price I would expect these features. I heard from the developer, which I do appreciate. He let me know that they would be adding more features. I hope he lets me know when they do. I wish there was another way to give it another trial at that time. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt change my stars at this time."
5,Leo Lynch 33,"I‚Äôve only been using it for a week, however, it‚Äôs been working well for me. The fact it sends you reminders to keep you consistent is exactly what I needed. The fact you can go back and read what you wrote earlier helps you see the pattern to what or why your mood changed. My wife and I both got the app and we do the experiments together and it‚Äôs only made us stronger as a couple. A big reason is because bearable has shown us our faults and is helping us grow individually which helps us as a team!!!"
5,STROMIE53,"I‚Äôve been using Bearable for several months now, and it has really helped me not only to monitor my medications, but help me with pain management- charting my symptoms helps so much!  The improvements come every few months - my only problem is my own: I haven‚Äôt entered time reminders for my meds.  My only wish?  That Bearable would incorporate more complex meal features- it would be perfect if it had a way to monitor kCal!!   But I have confidence that it is only a matter of time before this feature becomes available.  I recommend this app very highly!  Just as a note - I live in NJ."
5,chemgal12,"I‚Äôve tried so many symptom tracking/medicine tracking apps trying to find a way to manage multiple autoimmune diseases. This is the first app I‚Äôve stuck with for more than a few hours. It strikes a nice balance between being able to put in lots of data and making the data entry quick and easy. I also appreciate the mood and gratitude tracking as mental health has been the hardest for me to manage but is so critical for everything else.   I‚Äôm so excited to see new features, as the developer clearly has put a lot of thought and care into the app to this point."
5,the cane & able,"I have schizophrenia and several other disorders and finding good apps has been difficult.  Little free features, disorganized (hard to deal with if you have schizophrenia!), and ridiculous prices to get the features you need.  Immediately upon opening I couldn‚Äôt believe how well organized it was and how nice the graphics were.  It was simple and easy to process.  Then I realized how much customization there was for the free version. You could add and edit symptoms, add symptom groups, factors, etc.  I was so impressed by what was available to me without payment that within the first day I subscribed.  The price is also very reasonable.  I do not regret it ‚Äî I already absolutely love this app and use it every day. I‚Äôve had it about a week but it‚Äôs already helped me so much, and with memory issues, it‚Äôs nice to go back and actually see what my days were really like.  10/10 Recommend"
5,Hattie1298,I was very nervous at first. Since a lot of these apps say one thing but don‚Äôt entirely have what I need. I knew I needed something less generalized and vague but couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it until I saw a Instagram ad for this and was like ‚Äúthat might be what I‚Äôm looking for ‚Äú  Surprisingly it is. Especially with my heart condition to my hormones being wack. Tracking it and having more detailed options help me organize and manage clearly.  It even helped when I tried advocating for myself at the doctors with proof I‚Äôm not being dramatic.
5,Hyacinthbucketak,"I can‚Äôt get over how good this app is‚ÄîI‚Äôve tried many health tracking apps and Bearable does everything I had hoped the others would. It has transformed my life with a severe chronic illness. I now have data that I can use to understand correlations between what I do and how it affects me. I have detailed information I can share with my providers. Frankly, it‚Äôs helping me answer questions about my illness that I didn‚Äôt know I had and could lead to some symptom improvement. It‚Äôs mind-bogglingly useful to anyone who has a chronic health condition."
5,harper-pitt,"I got really sick all at once last month. Like four different kinds of sick, a dozen meds a day sick, sobbing because I‚Äôm so overwhelmed sick.   I found Bearable by luck and I‚Äôm so grateful I did. It lets you track so much ‚Äî meds, food, symptoms, etc. It‚Äôs helped me keep track of what I‚Äôm taking, experiencing, and feeling, which makes it easier to take care of myself and to share updates with my doctors.   Huge recommend. When you‚Äôre sick, a little bit of control can make a huge difference. This app gives me more control."
5,Dinneen from Retrain Back Pain,"Not only does Bearable offer a whole bunch of symptoms tracking categories, but you can also integrate lifestyle & habit tracking (everything is optional of course).  For example, you can track hydration, outdoor time, screen time, socialization, food, exercise. But the best part is that every category & it‚Äôs subcategories is editable, hideable and moveable so that you can designate names (w or w.o emojis) & organize lists so that what you need to see first is at top (this is key for meds & vitamins). A great product, I highly recommend."
5,alucasp,"SO helpful!! bearable is the first mood tracker that i've actually used consistently. there's so many things to track, and so much room for customization in order to get what you need out of the app. i've been using the free version so far to make sure i'd actually stick to using it before committing to buying premium. i so rarely pay for premium apps, but this has been a lifesaver with my recent BPD diagnosis, so i'm going to be upgrading right after i finish writing this review. ü•∞ 10/10 recommend"
5,MadiG13,"I have multiple autoimmune conditions and have never been able to find an app, journal, or sheet to help me accurately manage or track my daily routine, life changes, and symptoms. Anyone with chronic illness knows that being able to see the correlations and changes in your lifestyle, medications, etc is everything. For me it‚Äôs always been a headache to do so‚Ä¶ but honestly this makes it enjoyable and simple for me. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough, it‚Äôs exactly what I needed!"
5,Bigcockinnabooty,"I have been using Bearable to track my water intake, sleep, medication, mood, and symptoms. I love how I can track various things without having to use multiple apps or pay extra.  Even without the subscription this app is amazing and worth downloading. It would be nice if they could add a widget for the iPhone home screen or lock-screen. Other than that this app is user friendly and colorful and I look forward to using it everyday. ü§ç"
5,Patty2347,"I was recently given a ‚Äúpossible‚Äù lupus diagnosis and need to track my symptoms and lifestyle to see what is causing certain symptoms. This app is the one app that combines EVERYTHING! I‚Äôve tried other apps that track your period, your food, migraines, symptoms, meds, etc. but this one has it all. I support them so much that I bought a year subscription to the premium version. You get nearly every input for the free version, which is awesome. You just unlock all of the charts and analysis once you pay for premium."
5,CeceChristine,"I HAVE to submit a review for this app because it is stellar! Input and design are very slick and easy to understand. The app is customizable so I can use it for all kinds of different tracking needs. Between chronic pain, anxiety, BFRB and lactose intolerance, I am able to track all of them in one place and customize my factors and symptoms to fit exactly what I need to track. I am still using the Clue app for period tracking due to the period-specific diagrams, but everything else is going to this app! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!"
5,TS9876543210,"Bearable is a beautifully crafted app that helps me track so many of my different metrics and then compiles them for me to view in an easy to understand way. I love it! You can add as much or as little information about yourself and your day as you like. The layout is pleasing to the eye and the more I use it the more I wsnt to add more info so I can see my trends. It's reasonably priced too for a subscription. Check it out, you'll agree that it's great for you, too! ü©∑ Thanks, devs!!"
4,PatternDuo03,"So far this app has been great. I‚Äôve tried many of the competing apps and have otherwise been disappointed until Bearable. I‚Äôd give 5/5 stars BUT my only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt seem that you can sync your data across multiple devices with the purchased app installed.  For me that‚Äôs frustrating, and I hope to see an update that fixes this problem.  However, the interface is really user friendly and covers all the bases with customization options everywhere.  Try it!"
5,Icameasgold,"I recommend browsing the Bearable subreddit, or possibly their discord prior to set-up.   I personally set mine up kinda Willy-Nilly in the beginning, and while still acting as a  good self-accountability tool, I was not using the features of the app to my fullest advantage. After I saw what others were doing, it really gave me better framework for setting things up to BECOME what would be utilization of the features to my full-advantage. So that was very helpful!  Left to my own devices, I nearly can NOT will myself to do the most basic of tasks. But caring about maintaining my insights accurately has truly added that little ‚Äúoomph‚Äù I needed to hold myself accountable.   I am stoked to move forward and see if my mental health improves as a result of accountability. More so than that, I am eager to draw a line between my actions and my state of being."
4,iscbrn,"This app is normally INCREDIBLE, but I haven‚Äôt been able to use it for over a week because every time I log into my account, it kicks me back out to the log-in screen.  The only reason I can think of for it to do this is the fact that I switched devices recently. I made sure to log out on my old phone, and I‚Äôve also tried closing the app, reinstalling it, clearing cache, etc.  Other than those recent problems, the app has been great - exactly what I was looking for. Just wish I could actually use it again!"
5,Caimacmay,"As someone with chronic pain and illness, I have been to so many doctors and they never knew what was wrong despite multiple tests. After tracking signs and symptoms for two months, I finally found what was wrong and my doctor started me on meds for it. I haven‚Äôt had that pain since.   It is wonderful to finally know what‚Äôs wrong with you and get the answers. It just took me logging *all* of the things BUT thankfully it was all in one place"
1,Disappointed app user 9999,"Silly app makes you sign up to even try to use the app. -1 How to fix? Maybe allow users to try the app before you start bombarding them asking for all their info so you can sell it? Lol  Multiple privacy issues. -1 How to fix? Why does this app need to link all these different things to me?  Why does it have to keep track of any of that stuff? Why can‚Äôt everything linked to me stay on my device only? Weird.   Subscription model with no lifetime option. -1 How to fix? Again, apps these days are completely out of their mind. Everything has to be connected and paid for monthly because‚Ä¶ ‚Äúupkeep of the app‚Äù‚Ä¶? I think this trend needs to die and it can not die soon enough that‚Äôs for sure.   -1 star again, just because you gave me enough reasons to knock your app down to 2!  How to fix? Maybe stop following this stupid trend of monthly/yearly payments for a freaking APP that doesn‚Äôt give me enough incentives to keep paying for it monthly. It‚Äôs a freaking MOOD TRACKER app! Pay YOU, to let you sell MY info?   Have you all just lost your minds at this point?"
5,marystim,"Like most people who stumble onto Bearable, I‚Äôve tried all sorts of different apps for mental health and chronic illness tracking. This is hands down the best option.   The survey interface is clean, quick, and thorough, and the metrics assessments are unbeatably intuitive. By valuing lots of user feedback, the creator has managed to make a simple yet robust user experience that is beyond prize-worthy.   This app has changed my ability to communicate and assess my ‚Äúinternal state,‚Äù and I‚Äôm so thankful! If you‚Äôre looking for a mental/physical health tracker, look no further!"
5,MacJett13,"I never thought about how I can use my phone to help me manage my chronic illness. This tool is invaluable. It allows me to track my symptoms because Bearable makes me want to come back and fill it in. I love it because of how awesome the insights are. It generates weekly reports on all kinds of things (mood, symptoms, sleep quality) as well as longer reports. This helps me communicate my needs with my doctors. I also use it as a way to remember to take my medications!"
5,lllllllliiiiiiiiaaaaaa,"i really struggle to check in with my wellbeing.  my mind is thinking about so many different things at any given time that often thoughts and consideration of my health is forgotten.  more so, as a kid, i was never taught to take care of/prioritize my health.  things like keeping others happy, healthy, and safe, academic achievement, making money, and just surviving were the priorities i was taught.  this has resulted in my health, both mental and physical suffering greatly despite my young age.   this app has been an amazing tool in learning how to be more mindful of my body and check in with my health.  thank you bearable team‚ô•Ô∏è this app has given me something i have been missing my whole life and hopefully with its help, i‚Äôll be able to find a little more healing and peace"
5,Spleeez,"I have been looking for an app to manage both mental and physical illness symptoms, along with medications, sleep, food, and my moods‚Äîthis app does it all. I came across this app by chance, and after using it, I‚Äôve subsequently deleted at least three other apps off of my phone.  I can manage everything I need in this one great app. It gives amazing insights into the relationships between activities, moods, and symptoms. I now know that Tuesdays are hard for me and rainy days help my mood.  I can even see the impact that meaningful events have on my mood 30- and 60-days out. It‚Äôs all these little gems that I love about the app.   It even integrates with certain Apple Health modules.  There are a few things that I‚Äôd like to see in the future, such as passcode protection and more Apple Health integration, but ultimately, it‚Äôs a fantastic app."
4,therosem,"I‚Äôve tried a lot of symptom trackers to manage my IBS, endometriosis and PCOS. This is the first one that allows me to track DETAILS about my symptoms more closely than details of my diet. As someone who is trying to break up with diet culture; I really appreciate that while I can enter details about my diet; the app doesn‚Äôt ask me to measure my food or put moral warnings on my choices. Instead, they focus on letting me put in details about my well-being, medication, and other more relevant information to my long term care."
5,gatorsmomm,"This app is truly a dynamic diary for really anything you want to keep track of. It is so easily customizable and forgiving if you want to make changes. I find a lot of value in recording and keeping track of things in my life. It is helpful for me, but also a thorough way to communicate with other people like a doctor, therapist, coach etc. My psychiatrist recommended it to me. I have since been using it every day and telling people about it."
5,m.grace.,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews for apps, but I love this one. A bit of background on why I use this: I have endometriosis and POT‚Äôs. Lately I‚Äôve been having a flare up and decided to try this app out to track my symptoms. This app is simple and perfect for just that AND I can track my diet and factors (like exercise, etc.) and it‚Äôs helping me keep track of taking my meds. Great app, try it out if you have chronic illness, it makes staying on top of things so much easier."
3,Caroline Alex,"The app was excellent in tracking daily symptoms, mood, food intake, stress level, activity level, a stool section and there was an area for extra notes. I have dysautonomia it was great for everyday tracking. The only huge drawback I had a difficult time exporting the data. I tried various ways to transfer my data and I could not succeed. I wanted to easily export most of the information to my doctors. I feel Bearable needs to resolve this issue. Please make changes so I and everyone can easily export their information."
5,Joe27472847,"This has been great so far.  I‚Äôve been using it everyday, still too early to see correlations but I‚Äôm optimistic that I will gain som insights.  I‚Äôve wanted an app like this for years, I just didn‚Äôt know what to search for.  At one point I was going to input data into an excel spreadsheet and do it myself, but I never got around to it, it would have been too time consuming.  This app does the work for you and gives you a fun interface to use ."
5,lumpyjumpy,I have IC and struggle with figuring out triggers when I‚Äôm a flare. It can be hard to listen to your body when there‚Äôs so many components to keep in mind. I began using this app a few days ago and it is SUCH a game changer. Takes so much of the guesswork out of symptom and factor tracking. My only critique would be having integration with apps like Strava and Natural Cycles. Hoping for that in the future. Thank you Bearable for the peace of mind and empowerment you‚Äôve afforded me!
5,Deb d1,"Just started using this a couple weeks ago, but so far I really like it. The interface wasn‚Äôt totally intuitive at first - it‚Äôs not always obvious where to log a particular activity/symptom. But after you get the hang of it, it‚Äôs easier. The customization is great - I can remove items I don‚Äôt want to track or add missing ones. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the reports soon of how my symptoms correlate with my behaviors."
3,i am Suzanne,"This app is very customizable and lets you track a lot. Generally very good for input, but i think struggles with visualization and analysis‚Äîbetter to export data and do that on your own. There are many visualization options, but all are much too limited or not useful (for me). The app also has ‚Äúinsights‚Äù and experiments about how different things you log are correlated, but there is not much statistical information, only the average and nothing on sample size or statistical significance, which makes it impossible to rely on."
5,Depression Barbie,"A great way to track triggers and the benefits of self-care for chronic illnesses. Every symptom and possible correlation you want to study can be typed in and tracked. There‚Äôs even reminders and healthy habit tracking. The developer is very responsive and is continually taking suggestions from users to add features. The only negative is Apple indicates that the company collects your identifying health data, which is morally iffy given it‚Äôs a paid subscription."
5,Lindsay41520,"I really enjoy how customizable the app is. It‚Äôs a powerful tool I‚Äôm happy to take advantage of in lieu of therapy. I only wish for more layout/color options.  Edit: it‚Äôs been two weeks and I‚Äôm still having a lot of success tracking my moods and finding the trends. I like that it seems the creators care about maximizing the utility of the app, and I‚Äôve already seen some cool changes.   I can see myself using this app long-term."
5,Sammers28,"I downloaded this app after being diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and needing to track my symptoms to notice any changes. After downloading, I learned that it was so much more than symptom and medication tracking. The app is so customizable you can add whatever moods or symptoms or whatever you want. I loved it so much I actually bought the subscription. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a tracking app for symptoms and medication and more!"
4,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,!!.?' C","I just started using this app and I‚Äôve found that it has nearly everything I could want. I find the ability to see all the data and compare different factors really cool and helpful when trying to track different things all at once. My only complaint is that in the newest update, I seem to have lost the ability to put in tags about sleep for each night past the first! Other than that small detail, this app is really worth getting for anyone looking to track physical or mental health."
5,Bread Pirate,"Small team of developers working on this app, that really care and it shows. Been a subscriber for a few years now, I‚Äôve lost count but could check the app to know for sure :)  I used this app to help me figure out the source of migraines and it led me to getting a late diagnosis for adhd. It was really helpful having so much data to show my health care providers to support what I‚Äôve always known intuitively."
5,Suletu,"I have struggled for years with a litany of symptoms that I couldn‚Äôt figure out the correlation to. This app was a saving grace. In just a month, I have been able to find the correlations I need to finally start bettering my health based on my own lifestyle data (and not she said he said) so I can report my findings back to my doctor. Well worth the price! And‚Ä¶ the app is absolutely adorable and easy to figure out! Please try it!"
5,Wyodog,"Have rarely reviewed apps, but because I received exceptionally prompt service from the developer and my overall satisfaction with the app lead me to write one.   I‚Äôve tried a bunch mood trackers but deleted all of them. This is only one that works for me. I really enjoy the layout and the level of customization. The key thing is the customization allows you to see via graphs any patterns (‚Äúinsights‚Äù in app). It‚Äôs easy to track as much or as little as you want.   That‚Äôs the most important thing is to enter things quickly and efficiently in order to make it a daily habit. This app really works for me and you can sync across iOS devices.   James, the developer, answered my email promptly and help me sort out an issue due completely to my forgetfulness and was professional and helpful."
5,Cococat54321,"I love the Bearable allows me to track physical and mental health symptoms all in one app, as well as to track and remind me to take medications, and also has gratitude journaling built-in. The ability to view graphs of my symptoms and create experiments to see what is working and what isn‚Äôt has been invaluable. I recommend this app to anyone living with any sort of diagnosis, especially if you have multiple like I do."
3,Faaaaaded,"This app is perfect in all ways except one fatal flaw, I can‚Äôt track my symptoms with exacts times of the day! I can do bowel movements and mood, but I have to generalize the symptoms in buckets throughout the day. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out what‚Äôs been causing my fatigue for the past 2 years and having the option to track more granular trends in time would be very very helpful. I‚Äôm a premium user but going to have to find a new app that offers this feature which is really unfortunate cause the UI/UX is amazing on Bearable"
5,AshGuidry,"I‚Äôve been using the app for about a week and using the free trial of the premium version. Absolutely love it and I‚Äôm pretty certain I will be keeping it. I love how you can add custom symptoms and factors, track your medications and add events plus moods. You can literally track just about everything. The insights are great and I can share them with my doctors and husband to let him know when I‚Äôm having an absolutely terrible day or a great day."
4,Dreamlandia,"I like this app a lot, been using it for years and I'm still happy with it. I've tried several different symptom tracker apps and this by far has been the best in my experience. However, it would be nice to have the ability to set a symptom for several days. Like if I had the same symptom for the last week, I would like to select a date range and just set it once instead of having to go into every single day to do that. Can you guys add that feature please? Thanks <3"
5,Chenoa B,"I have multiple health and wellness concerns that I want to keep track of, and this app is really incredible for customization and seeing patterns. I am using it to see what medications are working and when, as well as keeping track of meals to check what foods might have an effect on my symptoms. I highly recommend this, especially if you have multiple diagnoses to keep track of."
4,gabrielle27,This is the most customizable health app I‚Äôve come across. Even using the unpaid version there are so many options and factors to track if you choose. So far the only feature it doesn‚Äôt have that I really need is the ability to input side effects from specific medications. I don‚Äôt want to track side effects under the symptoms categories because it becomes too confusing to differentiate and make informed decisions about medications.
5,Foxy552,"This is the best mood tracking/ medication journal app I ever had and I‚Äôve actually spent time looking. So you can either use it as a mood tracker or a medication journal, but you can use it for both and it has everything you need to track your moods along with whatever else is going on and it will show you results. You can even do experiments."
5,chaosdonkey87,"I haven‚Äôt used this for long but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt like tracking a lot of information about my health and wellness is pretty easy to do. It‚Äôs very customizable so you can stay general or get really granular if you want, and it also has a few different ways to interpret the results which makes it easy to understand. Looking forward to what I find out once I have more data!"
5,nellygdjfj,"I LOVE Bearable! It‚Äôs a great health tracking app that has everything in one system! The low price for a yearly subscription is absolutely worth it. They listen to their users for updates and are constantly adding helpful features and making improvements. I‚Äôm a big data nerd, so I love that I can see correlations and other metrics. It‚Äôs also fairly customizable. Overall, I‚Äôm just so glad I found this app!"
5,JJJJJJJ173838484,"Excellent app. Very easy to use and gives a pretty diverse set of things you can track with options for customizing. I used it to track and find the triggers of my chronic headaches. I found the main trigger and am down from 5-6 headaches a week to 3-4 headaches a month now! Also learned some other things along the way.   Their app also keeps getting better - I feel like they‚Äôre always improving and tweaking it. Thanks, Bearable. Great stuff."
5,crwsunny,"Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for adding the ability to enter times in 12 hour am/pm format!!   I love having a central place to keep track of my symptoms and things I did each day. It is a great tool to use in the evening and reflect back on the day. It allows me to look at trends over time, which is helpful. The app has a very user-friendly layout and cute design and I would definitely recommend!"
5,tulippapo,"I really enjoy this app, it makes it so easy for me to track all of my issues (I have a lot üòÖ) and also my daily habits! I used to use different apps for different things and it never worked well for me, this app puts everything in one and it‚Äôs perfect. Even if there isn‚Äôt a category for something I want to track, I can just make my own. The design is great too and it‚Äôs very user friendly"
5,Gloaming1974,"Finally‚Äîa symptom tracker that is helpful! I have severe ME/CFS and fibromyalgia. Because these are (so far) little-studied illnesses, there aren‚Äôt any treatments/cures. Most of what is helpful is holistic. This app lets me look at things like massage and the corresponding effects. I‚Äôve been using Bearable for 2 weeks, and even though it doesn‚Äôt show a ton of insights yet, it‚Äôs already incredibly useful just for looking at my symptoms over time. Thank you so much for making this app."
5,aspin987,"I just recently started using the app, and I cannot go back! I am autistic along with a list of other health issues and everything ties together and affects the others. I got this to see what causing my seizure like episodes, and I‚Äôve found this helps with more that! I recommend this to EVERYONE! I would just really enjoy the ability to share certain inputs with others, like caregivers or doctors!"
5,littletinydagron,This is an amazing app. I‚Äôve been using it for a few months and I continue to be impressed by it. It‚Äôs so easy to use and to understand where and how to enter things. I also love how I can add any factors or effects that I think are relevant and they are easily incorporated into the tracking and analysis. The app creators are excellent at taking feedback and making helpful updates.
5,IN User,"I use the app to stay on top of a chronic illness. I started with the free version, tracking all my symptoms, meds and possible triggers. Then I paid for a subscription, because I wanted to support this remarkable resource. Now that I have a better understanding of my illness, I‚Äôve streamlined my usage so I can track symptoms and meds with just a few clicks each day. Bearable is a lifesaver!"
3,lover84,"I have a few chronic conditions and my initial reaction from first use is that the medication area leaves something to be desired. As someone who takes a lot of prescription and over the counter medication, only being able to enter one ‚Äúunit‚Äù isn‚Äôt great. For instance, my Advair is two medications in one. I also have as medications that have more then one medicine in it: Zytec-D, Osteo Bi-Flex, Multi, Biotin, Iron, Fish Oil, etc.   Another medication issue is that if you use more them one ‚Äúamount‚Äù there is no way to understand if you set the ‚Äúunit‚Äù per one or multiply it to match the ‚Äúamount‚Äù."
5,Zenr3nn,The app is fantastic for accounting for many different stressors in life. I plan to try the 7 day free trial once I have a solid 7 days of inputs so that I can see how everything correlates.  I found this app because I needed something to remind myself to check in with my emotions once an hour because I normally bottle up my feelings until the bottle breaks. This is a really cool app!
3,CaffinatedDiabetic,I love the concept of Bearable. I‚Äôm sure it could be very helpful. But the app does not work well enough to consistently log. Every single time I open the app to do something it freezes or crashes. It takes forever to log anything because you have to wait for the app to stop freezing every 5 seconds. I want to use the app! I would even buy premium if the app actually worked! I‚Äôm hoping it gets fixed because this is the only app that does what I need it to do.
5,wxboss,"I have been looking for an app that can track all the things this app does, but I always had to settle for multiple apps that generally specialize in a certain area and then bounce back and forth between them. Not any more!   Bearable is really a well thought out and implemented app which I realize is still in its infancy, but you wouldn‚Äôt know that if you try it. This app is a keeper, and I look forward to what lies down the road for it."
1,ajdovovosnsnrofj,"I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that these mental health apps out there out there only offer short trial periods. Anyone that had made efforts to take control of their mental health and/or overall well being knows for a fact this is not a 7 day journey. I understand nothing in life is free, people spend time and effort to develop apps and programs to help people; However, knowing that any self development journey takes the same amount of not more time and effort, I say shame on this company. I wish I could give less than one star for the 5 minute experience I had just downloading the app and setting up an account."
5,Gracie12345678910,"I love Bearable, it‚Äôs made tracking my plethora of mystery symptoms so much easier than it would‚Äôve been. Before I was keeping multiple notes app notes to try to remember connections, but now i can put them all in Bearable and the app will even make connections/show me correlations between symptoms and factors that I never would‚Äôve expected. Highly recommend to everyone."
2,Aunty Social,"I have a chronic pain condition that I need to track symptoms throughout the day. The limited time slots (midnight to 6AM, 6AM to noon, noon to 6PM, 6PM to midnight) are completely useless when my symptoms can (and do) change within fifteen minutes. Additionally, the four levels to measure symptoms does not match the 0-10 pain scale that is common in the medical field. Multiple users have requested this feature/capability in the Bearable Changemap, with the first request made in December 2020. I‚Äôm not willing to keep paying for an app that doesn‚Äôt meet my needs."
4,Knoperz,"This is a super cool app and it has a lot of potential in my eyes. I basically wanted to build this exact app but never found the time. So glad someone else did though. Since it's young, it still has some bugginess to work out, like editing the order of factors doesn't really work well and is quite glitchy, I wasn't able to update the time of a gratitude log, etc. But I love this initial idea, and am excited to see how this app develops and smooths out the kinks over time!"
1,jjwodef,1. Confusing purchase on the trial and when it ends that left me paying for it when I was going to cancel.  2. I didn‚Äôt use it at all because it‚Äôs overwhelming and when I logged on months later first thing it does is give me a pop up asking me to pay for another annual subscription when this one is only 3 months old. Much cheaper price for the new one and gross - thanks for charging twice as much a few months ago and telling me you ripped me off.  3. Try to access account info and they have a touchscreen button for account icon and email that usually would take you into those details on other platforms but this one it ‚Äòinstantly restored‚Äô premium without any confirmation this was going to happen or choice. It‚Äôs very misleading.   4. Why did I have to restore something I paid for a year of and it‚Äôs only been a few months? This makes no sense and I‚Äôm done with this overly complicated app.
5,Taisha_93,I‚Äôve been using this app for several months now. It really helps me stay accountable for taking my medicines and doing simple things like paying attention to how much quality sleep I‚Äôm getting. I love the features of this app and being able to add things I find important to my daily routine like taking a shower. This app is really helpful and definitely worth it.
5,Maddieamie,"Been using this app for literally years since I was told to track symptoms for my condition. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without this app so consistently. Every new thing that comes up, it seems like there is already a built in function for it on this app. Thank you for making a tough situation easier by giving me the tools to advocate for myself and my symptoms."
5,SillyRedHeadGirl,"This app is fabulous. It has so much customization, which really makes it personable to you. You can track everything and anything you want using it. Highly recommend! The one downside, although, for being pretty small, is being able to use it on multiple devices. It does not sync or work well."
5,theiceberggg,"I have a few different health issues and wanted to track my symptoms over time, along with medications and sleep. This app does exactly this! It‚Äôs super easy to use, i hop on every night before bed to fill out my data for the day. The customizability is perfect, it lets you add any symptom, group them how you want, etc. The data is super cool too! Awesome to see what medications help what symptoms, and overall trends over time. 6 stars!"
5,M_Lynn_V,"I typically do not write reviews.  However, as I‚Äôm getting older and striving to be more in connection with my mind and body I have found this app to be the perfect companion in tracking my physical symptoms and mental health.  The layout and font is appealing (for those who enjoy visual aesthetics). I have various symptoms that come and go (vertigo, trigger finger, ankle pain are a few examples) so this app is perfect for documenting when I have a flare up.  It is highly customizable for its various categories of tracking. The ability to add a note to a single entry is also very useful.  It provides the ability to analyze the history of your entries in various report type formats and charts.  Kudos for a well built app that adds value to my life."
5,StellaJones111,"The app interface is so user friendly and makes you want to log your inputs multiple times a day. Without even looking at the charts, it makes me reflect on the impacts of the variables in my life. When I do look at the charts over weeks at a time, it is illuminating when something needs to be addressed or when something is really working. Love it!"
5,uxresearcher,"Prior to Bearable I have been trying to track my multiple symptoms and intensities on my own, in a docs file, so that I can share the data with my 4 specialists.  It took a lot of time to initially create and even worse, when it came to following through with recording data, I didn‚Äôt do it.  My day to day, hour to hour struggles became too much to deal with and recording became too taxing.   As a UXR and UXD, I am very critical in terms of usability, it is my job to be, but I was so delighted with the usability of this app that I contacted James to let him know how he had exceeded my expectations. He clearly listens to his users and designs with ease in mind. Fantastic job, looking forward to greater things to come."
5,RabbitPhotog,"It can be hard to keep track of all of my medical issues and medications. This makes it very easy for me to keep track and also to keep encouraged. Just tracking all of the information, including my mood, makes me stop and reflect on my mood. The only thing I would like to see added is the ability to record A few notes about what I dream every night."
5,ShellyRinNC,"I love this app! As someone who lives with chronic illness (POTS and IBD) as well as anxiety & depression, I find this app so easy to track my symptoms and flares and to look for possible triggers and causes. I have tried other apps in the past, but none were as extensive and helpful as this one! It‚Äôs so easy to customize it to the things I want to track. And I‚Äôve found the reporting to be so helpful!"
5,ciparevalo,"I‚Äôve been using this app for about 6 months and it‚Äôs by far the best I‚Äôve come across over the years! I wouldn‚Äôt even call it strictly a mood tracker, it helps me track all of my physical and mental symptoms and medications as well. The ability for customization is incredible and no other app I‚Äôve tried is like it. Planning on sticking with it long-term!"
5,platypuslynn,"I am a woman with autism, and this app feels like it was made for me. I can track anything and everything, and quickly tell if i‚Äôm getting depressed or consistently forgetting about hygiene. this app has helped with my self awareness tenfold, and helped me realize which treatments make a tangible difference in my chronic illness. I cannot recommend this app enough."
5,Jbanks21,This app changed my life. It‚Äôs the only app that truly helps keep track of my symptoms and moods during that difficult time of the month for me. I used this app to help identify and understand my disorder and taught me how to stay on top of it. I am very grateful t have a space to log and keep track of it all while being easily accessible and easy to understand.
5,glitterbugpsyd,I‚Äôve only just been using it a week but I tried a couple other similar apps that I quickly found limitations in. I like how easy it is to go back and fill in past days if needed. The app has a good look and appears to be very customizable. I'm excited to see the insights once I've been tracking for awhile.
4,PenguinPhoneHome,"I‚Äôm in eating disorder recovery and have many mental and physical health issues. The app I used to use only allowed me to track my food intake, behaviors, and a set list of emotions. Bearable allows me to track endless custom options and keep better track of my health and recovery. I can also delete sections when I no longer need to track a symptom or factor, update my med list, and keep detailed insights for my doctors appointments. Thank you!"
5,lovelytulips,I have lupus and this has helped me tremendously for my Rheumatology and Hematology appointments. If you have any health problems I would highly suggest this app! When the time comes for your appointment Bearable creates a spreadsheet to organize what symptoms and habits you have tracked daily. This will make it easier for you and your doctor when it‚Äôs time to visit.
5,harborhealthmtp,"I‚Äôve been using Bearable for 6 months to track my child with PANDAS symptoms, medication, sleep, food etc. It keeps me organized and helps me see if she‚Äôs progressing or in a flare. I love that I can quickly sort each section during check ups with providers. It has really helped me to stay on top of my daughter‚Äôs issues and better help her."
5,SomeoneSomehowSomewhere,"I‚Äôve tried almost every pain/symptom/illness tracker on the App Store. Bearable is the first app I‚Äôve stuck with for more than a day. I‚Äôve been using it for almost a month now. Simple UI packed with tons of options helps me track every symptom, every med, every factor. Data is presented in a straightforward, easy to compare format. Bearable is everything I‚Äôve been looking for in this kind of app!"
5,Arielledross,I‚Äôve been using this app for months now and I‚Äôm a big fan. The team behind it is super responsive (check out their discord) and the design is really thoughtful. It‚Äôs helped me figure out what might be causing issues and I love that I can create an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù when I start a new medication to see how it‚Äôs impacting me. Highly recommended.
5,sunnycow92,I have a lot of mental health and other physical health things going on and this app makes it easy to track everything in one place. I especially love being able to track my food without having to track my calories. It‚Äôs super easy to use and I love how personalize-able it is! I haven‚Äôt even explored the premium version and I love it!
4,"185629;$;)-@?,‚Äôma","I lost access to premium for weeks and the instructions to fix it did nothing. One day, premium just came back without notifying me and support never said they fixed anything either. I wish they were more responsive in the process but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs fixed. I use the app to track many medications and an episodic chronic illness and it‚Äôs excellent for me for that."
4,Thompsons Gazelle,"I think this app is the best in its class, but I think it still has quite a ways to go before I would consider it a great app. So many little (and big) things that make you scratch your head at how the app has gone so long without x feature.   One big redeeming factor is the free tier is decently generous, and I think the discounted yearly price (which is offered like 24/7) is reasonable."
5,Gregggers,Excellent product built on vision to improve quality of life.  I‚Äôve seen dramatic results in last 6 weeks simply due to the awareness and discipline of tracking mood etc.  Support team was very responsive in helping me resolve a technical issue.   Probably an abundance of similar tools - of the ones I tried - I liked this the best.
5,shlynard,I have been on so many tracker apps and this is by far the best. I actually stay motivated to use it and premium is so worth it. The app is so detailed and personalized and the experiment option to look for correlation is the best part. Only thing that could be better is more accurate time stamps because for some reason mine is in military time
5,RBAuden,I have many chronic illnesses and needed an app to track all of these come-and-go symptoms. Being able to add custom symptoms is a great tool other apps don‚Äôt have. I do wish there was a place to make note of extreme and different/uncommon symptoms without adding them to the list permanently. I love this app.   I can also assure you I am a human. This app is great :)
5,theenumberfour,"I‚Äôve been using Bearable for a little under a month now and it has been super helpful. I‚Äôve been able to see what does and doesn‚Äôt affect my mood, keep track of meds I take, as well as track my sleep, among a hundred other things. It helps me feel more ‚Äúin-control‚Äù each day.  I really enjoy it!"
5,"t√∏p, AJR, FOB, NF fann","I was struggling to manage my depression, anxiety, and pain disorder. Being able to keep track of my good and bad days has helped me be able to look back and see what causes all of them and I can now do more to stay positive. I can track my mood throughout the day and see what trends there are and in relation to things like pain and sleep. This has really helped"
5,Essedwrds,"I love this app because the free version is surprisingly detailed! Also, the options for a range as the answer, as opposed to a yes/no, makes this app unique from most symptom tracker apps I‚Äôve used before. This app is obviously designed for us chronic health/pain having people with several co-morbidities which is super rare and for that I‚Äôm grateful!"
5,halegray,"This app is amazing. I‚Äôve tried every tracker app in the App Store and this is the only one that does everything I need it to - and more. It‚Äôs so flexible, too, which means I can turn off features I‚Äôm not using or add more symptoms/factors than just the stock ones. Only thing I might add is the ability to add more than one sleep time - I‚Äôm a chronic napper and know that it affects my mood and health."
5,TIAB0526,I have been using bearable for almost a year. I absolutely love it! I love seeing trends and how certain symptoms can be related to certain foods I eat or activities I do. I also love how it creates a little time for me to check in with myself and really helps me keep track of how I‚Äôm feeling! Definitely worth every penny.
5,NoneYa74928,"This app is one of the only apps to actually work for me. I find it hard to track things like my mood and eating but this app is a great one-stop shop for keeping track of everything. It tracks sleep, food, water, feelings, and symptoms. I sound like I'm sponsored üòÇ but I stand by this app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Fratkinson,"I absolutely love this for keeping track of triggers for my sleep, allergies, and EDS. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt SO expensive up front due to my limited income ‚Äî it‚Äôs about a fourth of what I‚Äôm getting a month right now waiting for my disability ‚Äî so I‚Äôll likely have to cancel after the trial. Please consider doing a monthly subscription!"
4,Teeetwo,"I‚Äôve been searching for a good symptom tracker app for years and this comes pretty close. I love that you can track so many different things (exercise, caffeine, sleep, mood, physical symptoms, and so much more). However, I really need an app that will correlate symptoms with the food I eat. If that feature gets added I will definitely subscribe again!"
5,wildchild022008,"This app is AMAZING. Exactly what I was looking for and more. It's worth every single penny. It's incredibly easy to use. I have multiple chronic conditions, some of which affect memory, and this app is an absolute lifesaver. It makes communication with my doctors easier, more accurate, and more efficient. This is my first ever review for an app but I'm so impressed. Buy it."
5,thewolf4t,I‚Äôve tried many apps before this plus my own journaling. I just started with this app. So far it is the most user friendly and useful app I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôm pretty sure this one I will stay with. Just a great user interface. Well thought out. Already has been useful for me. Very impressed! Thank you!
5,Gwizzlestix,"I never write reviews, but this is really one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. Not just out of health/self improvement apps, but all apps. It is easy to stay consistent. It‚Äôs user friendly, yet programmable to cater to your own needs. It‚Äôs making me more aware and conscientious. That is extremely valuable and life-changing, for me."
5,AwesomeFaceCrack,"I have lupus, cluster headaches, hypersomnia, and allergies. I know, I‚Äôm annoying. Sorry. I‚Äôve used at least a dozen symptom tracking apps and this one is by far the best and most comprehensive. It‚Äôs intuitive and only as in-depth as you want it to be. It works seamlessly with my Apple Watch. I‚Äôm so glad someone finally made an app that has easy to input tracking :)"
5,Sydyrae,I was about to investigate ways to design my own chronic illness app until I found Bearable. It does exactly what I want and is so customizable. I love how easy it is to input important health data and remove things I don‚Äôt need to track. I highly recommend even if you are only tracking a few key symptoms.
5,Jak22e,"I‚Äôm only scratching the surface of what this app is capable of.  I‚Äôm currently tracking my mood, food, mental health, and my sleep (linked to Apple) all in the app! I‚Äôm loving it and I love that you can make it as in depth as you want it to.  There‚Äôs so many things you can do that I‚Äôm still learning new features!   Any plans for iPad and/or Apple Watch support?"
2,Gerty B,"When you sign up, even if you don‚Äôt check off the sign up for marketing emails, they still send them anyway, against your request. I‚Äôve unsubscribed multiple times, confirmed in the settings I was not enrolled, yet the emails kept coming. I ended up deleting my account, maybe that will resolve the unwanted emails.  This app was relatively easy to use. A little cluttered but it seemed to be able to track some of the things I wanted. It didn‚Äôt do everything I wanted."
5,Hamstermorph,I have been using bearable for the last two months and it‚Äôs been the best app I have found so far. I love the fact that they communicate with their customers to find out what features are most important to you. The premium is worth the money for the active development and wonderful community.
5,Ellieana,"Every other app I've tried for tracking has been either clunky or missing features but Bearable is exactly what I have been searching for! Tracks everything, is highly customizable, has great analytics, and has a pleasant simple interface. I absolutely love it and am so grateful for it ü§ò"
4,Lulabyte,"I‚Äôve tried many of the health and mood trackers and while I still use some periphery apps, I could theoretically use this app for most anything I‚Äôd want to journal. I feel like the interface could be a little more compact and smooth, but it‚Äôs honestly one of the better mood and health journal apps out there. Thanks for making a great product!"
4,daph.d,"I use this app as accompaniment to my weekly therapy sessions and it provides really great insights for my psychologist and I to discuss!! The free version of the app is super well fleshed-out, so the premium version is definitely not a necessity. My only complaint about Bearable is that the amount of options it presents can get a little overwhelming, but most of them can be turned off if you so desire!!"
5,ACEme73,This app is fantastic for tracking both standard and custom symptoms. It‚Äôs intuitive and easy to use but has lots of great help and info when you need it. The ability to track and more importantly analyze the data has been very helpful in working with my doctors. Thanks for creating such a wonderful app!
5,lisabfl,Thank you for specifying on the first page of you description that this is for wellness and not fitness! So many ‚Äúwellness‚Äù apps push strenuous exercise it can be frustrating for those of us who do well just walk around the house some each day. Thank you for understanding the difference.
5,leelpatt,"I used a similar app before coming to Bearable. I was on the app for maybe a year. I‚Äôve been using Bearable for a month. I will say that Bearable does a much better job of making insights for me and reminding me of them. I feel like I‚Äôm learning more using this app, plus it‚Äôs cheaper with less bugs so that‚Äôs a win-win."
5,My Autoimmune Life,I have many autoimmune and chronic pain conditions that require me to track and note various aspects of my day. This is the only app that I need to do that. I‚Äôve been using it for about two years now and I highly recommend it to anybody and everybody that needs health tracking.
5,lauren.34,"If you have chronic health issues this app is a game changer.   As someone with multiple chronic illnesses (mostly diagnosed but some symptoms still being looked into) this app has helped me learn about how my conditions impact me and what factors influence the severity of my symptoms.  If you have chronic illnesses, this app can help you see fluctuations in symptoms, learn what works and what doesn‚Äôt work for you, and share information with your doctor. If you are undiagnosed, this app can help you collect data that can be instrumental in getting a diagnosis.  I pay for the premium version and feel it is more than worth it!"
5,Deej1223,On the last iPhone I had this app worked great!! But with my iPhone 11 this app doesn‚Äôt show the times I took my medication and some other stuff. It looks like it needs updated. Please try to update it because it worked so much better before.
5,Anty23,"Love the app so far, exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for to track my life and gain insight into what works/doesn‚Äôt. Since I already track and input the foods that I eat into Cronometer, I‚Äôd love a way to connect the data somehow, even if Bearable doesn‚Äôt incorporate the macro/micronutrients. Just want it to show what I ate so I don‚Äôt need to enter the info twice."
5,such think think to do,this app is AMAZING!!! it has really helped me and i really recommend it! there are in app purchases but the app still works amazing without them. it helps me find out what things are effecting my mood as well as being a way to get my emotions out and help me feel better. definitely recommend
4,Gogo_999,Great app! Use daily and definitely helps keep track of my life with ease. I would appreciate an option to allow changing the date on an entry. Sometimes I enter an entry past midnight and end up plugging in a ton of information on the wrong day. Then having to copy and paste everything over on the correct day. A little time consuming.
5,jubilee_juice,"Love this app for symptom tracking! I have long COVID and CFS and Bearable helps me manage my health and figure out which foods, medications, and pacing strategies are the most beneficial for me. Premium is definitely worth it for the customization and advanced analytics. The devs are very responsive and are constantly improving the app which is great."
5,Emma Sonas,"As someone disabled by chronic illness for many years, tracking symptoms is always something I need to do but struggle to do because of my symptoms. That makes finding patterns difficult and getting accurate diagnoses near impossible. So excited to find this app, and to see developer engagement over on reddit!!"
4,jaivjrncjabcjqfodkajivke,"Since the last update notifications are only coming through sporadically, which is a huge issue for me because I mostly use the app to track meds. My in-app and system notification settings are all the same as they were, there's just a new bug somewhere."
1,WhyDoIEvenHaveThis,"Since the update, the app keeps deleting my data. I‚Äôm furious as I‚Äôve been consistently entering every category meticulously and now it‚Äôs all for nothing.   Like when I mark that I‚Äôve taken my medication and I go back in and it‚Äôs deleted my entire day‚Äôs entries. Now I don‚Äôt know how many doses I‚Äôve taken of which tablet. You‚Äôre going to end up killing someone doing that.   I thought it was me at first, but no, I made the entries, screenshot them and when I go back in, the entries have been deleted.   Also, you‚Äôve added new categories but you have prefilled them for me with incorrect data going all the way back to when I purchased the app, rendering months of data entries worthless.   What a colossal waste of my time and energy to try and manage my illnesses.  Obviously I‚Äôve requested a refund from Apple."
5,stumplm,"With a long-term, chronic condition that really needs a lot of tracking to see patterns and to discern what is helping, Bearable is about the best app around to track EVERYTHING in one place.  Even the free version is very robust, so you can really use it and not just try it out. I really appreciate this app."
5,Lox072311,I‚Äôm 37 years old and experiencing an unexpected health crisis. Bearable has been such a great tool to keep track of my symptoms and see what is affecting it. A great way to show your doctors what‚Äôs going on as well. They make it very easy to watch health patterns and correlations. Definitely worth the small monthly fee.
5,Whitetulip31,Keeping logs is always a bit of a struggle for me. Usually it involves multiple apps or notebooks. Someone recommended Bearable and after setting it up I really started to like using it. It is very easily customizable and keeps all of the info I want to add to it. It is very comprehensive and easy to use.
5,FjordPrefect,"I‚Äôve tried and abandoned so many symptom trackers, but I‚Äôve stuck with this one religiously. Very easy to use, nice level of customization, and a benevolent privacy policy.   The free version has everything I need, but I‚Äôm going to upgrade just to support this amazing app.   Thank you, Bearable team, for making managing chronic health issues a little less terrible!"
5,SailingSmitty,"Have been using this app for a while. Love how easy it is to customize and use. Wish the sleep section were able to record multiple sleep intervals and combine those as total sleep for the day, but other than that no complaints."
5,Kroegern,I've tried 4 different trackers for health (meds/sleep/mood) and this one blows all of them out of the park. I usually don't write reviews but this is an incredible interface with a ton of options. It's user-friendly and offers statistical insights from your tracked items. 10/10
4,Eleasha_00,"I just paid for this app to track my medication, symptoms, moods, etc. It‚Äôs great for tracking as I get the hand of it.  However, I‚Äôm not getting the badge notifications (yes, they‚Äôre enabled on my settings). I get the initial notification but without the badge notifications for my medication, I forget to do it."
5,Samxye,"I needed only a simple app to help me track a variety of symptoms related to my health and anxiety. This (free version) of this app has offered exactly that with customizable symptom options, sleep tracker synchronization, and a variety of forms it can be tracked from really detailed in time to general overview."
5,Ellieaux,"I‚Äôve been beta testing this app for only a short while now, but it‚Äôs been great to see the improvements! The ability to log almost everything in a single place, with easy, is excellent and a great value. I look forward to learning more insight about myself as I input more time & data into it."
5,terimae,"I have been trying to track all the factors, symptoms, and nutritional needs for my chronic illness by hand for months. This app makes it so much easier to keep track of everything and provides fantastic insight. I would definitely recommend it."
5,carolynne4,I love that I found this app trying to help track my husbands current and changing symptoms. It‚Äôs going to be nice to show the Dr.s what has happened so far! I appreciate this and may not use it for what it was designed for but this is a life safer since my husband got diagnosed with a rare brain disorder! Thanks
5,SluggoBear,"This app has helped me journal my symptoms, medications, mood and food easily. Finally I can go to my doctor with actual data so we can make informed decisions about my health and how to manage any health problems I‚Äôm having.  The app has given me actionable insights about my health including identifying medication side effects, seeing the impacts of certain foods on my digestive system and in my daily alertness, helped me connect medication doses and times to my sleep etc.  The app has a bit of a learning curve, and it may take a few days to fine-tune it to your needs, but it is well worth it.  I am VERY pleased with this app!"
5,BLC812,This app is exactly what I need to track progression/regression of symptoms and to correlate with my mood and and pain. I‚Äôve lived with chronic pain for years and used to track these things in a notebook by hand. This app is so much quicker and easier. And has so much to offer even with the free version!
5,Rikenazu,"This app replaces three others I had, is much smoother to use, and includes easy to document, easy to access details. You can individualize your information in endless ways and it has genuinely helped me have a better quality of life."
5,Xanup,I deal with a very complicated medical history and one of the toughest challenges for my doctors have been trying to figure out how help me cope through my medical problems. Bearable has helped me tremendously by allowing me to daily log all of the symptoms I‚Äôm dealing with and more. I can‚Äôt wait for more features to come with this app!!!
5,aloraineb,"This app has added a lot of quality to my life so far. Before, I would use bullet journals to track my mood, gratitude, and fitness, but with having ADHD, it‚Äôs easy to forget. This app keeps it all in one with reminders! Plus I love seeing trends in the data over time."
5,Treetalker99,"For years I dreamed of an app that would help me track all my disparate health issues. This is efficient, cute, and friendly. I‚Äôve recommended it to two friends with very different post-Covid heath issues and they both found it helpful. It‚Äôs great to prepare for doctor‚Äôs appointments."
4,um....,This app is wonderful but I really wish there was more flexibility in the time and weight categories.  I didn‚Äôt really have an issue learning military time for this app but there is no way I‚Äôm going to convert my weight everyday from lbs to kgs.  I wish it would allow this flexibility to switch these things.  Other then that this app is very helpful.
5,TayaShell,"Bearable is an amazing app! I can track numerous symptoms, capture mood and energy levels and make notes as needed. The insights are super helpful when trying to compile information for a doctors appointment or to see a larger picture. Absolutely recommend for anyone dealing with chronic or ongoing health issues."
5,levitegirl,"Fantastic app. The customization is almost limitless so it can be used for any kind of wellness and symptoms tracking you want.  What‚Äôs really fantastic is the factor correlation feature that allows you to see, practically, how certain factors and impacting your symptoms/wellness.  Really well done."
5,Lennon Lance,"This is a GREAT app I have searched far and wide for an app that let me track everything I wanted to. I‚Äôve finally found an app that really allows me to effectively track my day to day to better understand what impact the way I feel. A really great app, so glad I found it."
5,Natt Attack,"This gives me so much customization opportunity in just the free version and it‚Äôs everything I need to help manage my medication and track my unpredictable MdDS symptoms. I tell all my friends with chronic illness about it!!!! It‚Äôs given me back so much control to my uncontrollable life.  Thank you for this app, Team Bearable!!!"
5,EdTeachCrow,"This app has already been a huge help in managing my PTSD symptoms, it‚Äôs great to see that even on tough brain days the bad doesn‚Äôt last for ever, and it‚Äôs an amazing way to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt to help me feel better- can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
5,danyschutte,"I have worked my way thru different bullet journal, flexible schedulers, etc. I am loving bearable. I am still learning more of what it can do for me, but what I am tracking, it‚Äôs great. To track my pain from fibromyalgia and my specific pain meds, it‚Äôs great."
5,FantabulousnessO_o,One of the few apps that I‚Äôve been able to keep consistently updated. It‚Äôs been really helpful for tracking mental and physical health. Definitely recommend! (I haven‚Äôt tried the premium however)
5,Sia7830,I‚Äôve tried almost all the symptom tracking apps on the App Store and this one is by far the most intuitive and versatile to use. The customization options are great and I‚Äôm able to track everything I need in one spot.
5,MommyTen,"Thanks for making this superior app. It had truly changed my life for the better. I can take control of my symptoms and figure out all the ‚Äúwhats, why‚Äôs, and how‚Äôs‚Äù of my health. I really feel ahead of the game of life. You guys are genius!!! Thanks again. I love my Bearable app"
5,Annabanana-6,I have been struggling with mysterious multiple health issues over the last year and trying literally dozens of treatments and approaches. I could not have kept track of it all and my responses without this tool. My doctors and I thank you!
5,Cassidy Kerns,Bearable is really easy to use and I love it. It has helped me keep better track of everything I need to keep track of. It is helping me monitor my health and my mental health. I did pick the premium but I think it is totally worth $6.99 a month! Highly recommend!
5,knives uwu,It makes it a lot easier to keep track of my symptoms and what foods i‚Äôm reacting to with my MCAS! It also helps that i can pull it up on my phone to show my doctors and nurses my symptoms and the foods I‚Äôm eating. I recommend this to all my fellow spoonies!
5,Kjoy13,"I‚Äôve tried a variety of tracker apps and this is by far the most excellent. It allows a lot of customization for what‚Äôs important to you and makes it easy to refer back to it. For example, I love that data is displayed in a timeline and you can search for specific words. I‚Äôm super impressed!"
5,mablezine,"Bearable has been a wonderful addition to my daily routine. I have multiple gastrointestinal complications and Bearable makes it simple to keep track of my medications, symptoms, diet, and factors that affect all of them. I am loving this app and cannot wait to see where it goes from here!"
5,Falalalarsen,"They only thing I wish it could do was sync everything with my Fitbit. Right now it‚Äôs half Apple health and 1/2 Fitbit.  But I love, Love,LOVE it, so far. If your body does weird things and your trying to find a correlation I highly recommend this app."
5,milchschoko,"App has everything i wanted and everything i could not even think i wanted, but turned out i needed. The developers seem to have their soul in this project and they are doing something that is helpful, useful and makes someone‚Äôs life better."
4,CurlyButtTomatoNose,It‚Äôs very useful and very helpful. My problem though is with the insights section. It doesn‚Äôt seem easy to read and it‚Äôs just very confusing in general. I think it has improved lately but I still have some trouble with it. Maybe I just need an update how to read them?
3,nikki62084,"I wanted to rate this app higher, but far too often I have issues with the app closing itself out and not being able to enter any data. It‚Äôs important that I log daily to help my doctors figure out a diagnosis and treatment. Aside from that, I really do like the app itself. It‚Äôs user friendly and you can customize your symptom list."
5,Ekackerman,"I have tried literally every other app, and then gave up and tried tracking manually in a notebook. Bearable is hands down the best health tracking app out there! I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful, and considering going premium to get more insights...but I love that the free option is so complete! THANK YOU!!!"
5,Alygatorinthevalley,"I am a stoic person who believes emotions are frivolous. Or I was until I found this app. It allows me to get out the emotions I‚Äôve internalized and develop healthy habits physically, mentally, and emotionally. I would pay to have this app and anticipate keeping it for the rest of my life."
5,Busy but mindful,This has been so helpful in tracking and reporting back to my Dr. I kept thinking I was able to show correlation and showed data. It also helped me see that my medication was working.
5,charlielawlor28,"I got this app at a really difficult time, and tracking my emotions and leaving small bits of gratitude made me feel better. I slowly stopped using the app as I got better, but everytime something happened I could use it."
3,Grassy road,"Doesnt work for my needs, which is mostly tracking pain and activities that may be related. Zero ability to make any kind of notes, and little ability to customize the interface and data gathered. I found a much better one for my particular focus."
5,Peace Out Óåä,"I really have enjoyed using this app. It‚Äôs easy to track your symptoms, mood, pains, and everything else! I wish they had a lock screen or home screen widget though to make it easier to log info."
3,LeukemiaSuckz,"This health tracker is a great option for individuals without severe health conditions, such as cancer, as it doesn't offer comprehensive coverage in this area and the pain tracking feature may not be effective for those of us with cancer. However, it excels in other aspects and is an excellent choice for those without such specific needs. üß°üéóÔ∏èüß°"
5,RT Dake,I tried several before landing on Bearable. I like the flexibility of this app and being able to record several times a day since my symptoms change by the hour. Also the cute bear makes me smile.
5,bearable fan!,"I‚Äôve been struggling with a chronic issue for years now, but could never claim exactly when I had symptoms and why and how. This app makes it very easy. I do have the paid version, but I think it is well worth the money."
5,Kelly9010,"This is great as someone who doesn‚Äôt yet have a diagnosis for chronic issues. I‚Äôm hopeful that having somewhere to track this all in one place will be helpful. The only two things I track outside of this app are migraines and menstruation, because those apps are so comprehensive!!"
5,Gummidgy,"I have a ton of symptom tracker apps and this is the best one I‚Äôve found by far. The UI is friendly and straightforward and you can get incredibly detailed about the things you choose to track (including customized symptoms, meds, etc.) I‚Äôll be using it daily!"
5,twentyseven111,Best app I‚Äôve seen that can track all the health things in one place. And the pro version is so much more reasonably priced than most apps that do way less. It‚Äôs been so useful for me and a positive experience.
5,Severman,"I have a chronic health condition as well some behaviors I‚Äôm trying to change. This app really helps me keep track of what I‚Äôm doing so I can make adjustments and refine what works for me. On another note, this app is beautiful! Kudos to your UX Designers and developers!"
5,Bri <34,"As a person with chronic conditions, this app is very useful and helpful to track symptoms and other factors every day. The days can be broken into time blocks (pre, am, mid, pm) which I really like. I only use the free version and I still love the app."
5,Wanderingella,I have narcolepsy and fibromyalgia as well as a few mental disorders. This is the only symptom tracker out there that lets me track all of my symptoms and find out what contributes to them. It truly works for everything. I highly recommend it.
5,charlotte the strawberry,"i‚Äôve tried a few different apps like this one, but bearable has come through the most. while other apps constantly bug me with adds or about switching to premium, you can still get the full experience without paying a ton of money or getting a ton of ads! this app has helped me a lot, and i reccomend it to anyone struggling with taking care of themselves or managing their busy lives."
5,Imeyeore,"No more switching from app to app and wishing I could add things or get rid of things I didn‚Äôt use. I can track everything here - physical, mental, gratitudes, sleep. And I can see how factors effect my mood, sleep, etc. Highly recommend if you have chronic illnesses!"
5,Raekoz,Trying to find the discipline to track has been the hardest part the app helps simplify things and stream line the process can‚Äôt wait to see what else I learn about myself from this app
5,hyperkitten357,It‚Äôs a little hard to set up and get the hang of using but very worthwhile once you‚Äôve got the hang of it. I‚Äôve used many trackers and they are either too complex or not flexible enough. I think this app gets the perfect medium.
4,Mojom00n,I just downloaded this app to help me take better care of my self care as well as be able to track my mental health and boost it up with the progression of time. I would love to be able to have a widget so i can see some of my goals/tasks that i need to get done!
5,anonymousFORMERuser,"Recently started using this app to track symptoms, spikes, and triggers. It‚Äôs easy to track factors such as food and weather, as well as medications taken. The app is very customizable and has so far suited my needs. Glad I found it!"
5,Dr. Clary,"A great app that does everything it claims! You can track just about anything and with relative ease. There‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve to get used to the more advanced functions of the app, but certainly nothing so complex as to stop me from recommending it to others.   Recommendations: 1) iPad version 2) Apple Watch version (currently you can receive notifications on Apple Watch, but there‚Äôs no ability to interact with the app from your watch) 3) iCloud/sync support across devices"
5,Space134,"Very useful, especially with the subscription! The one thing I‚Äôd change is for the custom metrics to be more customizable, since the 1 (awful) to 5 (great) doesn‚Äôt really work for what I wanna track, aka ‚Äúamount of walking‚Äù"
5,E 7724,"it has pretty much everything I need in one place and there are multiple different ways to add details that can help capture symptoms and factors thoroughly. I like the scales, situational factor options, and notes sections."
5,Raesunshine321,I have been tracking some of this in my journal to share with my therapist but the app makes it so much easier. There are so many options and it‚Äôs easy to share the data. I love it
5,Iloveallhorses!,"This app is so useful for tracking medication (and reminding you to take it), mood check ins, and recognizing and understanding factors that may be impacting your mood. It also syncs well with Apple Health and the Apple Watch."
5,doetdrkelp2020,"This is the best tracker I‚Äôve had (and I‚Äôve had a lot). It tracks symptoms, meals, mood, activity, sleep, and gratitude. I love that it has the option to add notes so I can log any other contributing factors. Bearable is the best and I can not recommend it enough. Thank you for creating this app!"
5,Allannon77,"I live with debilitating pain. It changes all the time, almost daily. This app is helpful because besides helping me track my symptoms, it is a way to voice my symptoms. This is very helpful mentally and emotionally! Thank you."
5,voteforeleni,this is the tracker I have been looking for! I love the breadth of symptoms and lifestyle factors you are able to track. the design is intuitive and good looking. I feel like this app understands me. thank you!!
4,Sbeck1978,I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 weeks. It has really helped me understand and visualize my emotions. I would like to see 2 things added. It would be helpful if I could track medication and my period so I could get a better understanding of how these affect me.
4,Gastoparesis,"I have loved this app, it has been very helpful. The one addition I hope for is that significant events you add will be treated either as factors and you can see how it affects specific symptoms or that you can at least see how it impacts sleep and energy."
5,Aaronjbach,I love this app. Support is speedy and the app is thoughtfully laid out. I had an issue with the app freezing which the developer fixed in under 12 hours. A week later and it‚Äôs working perfectly fine.
5,Theinternationalfriendly,"Only wish I had found this app sooner! I would pay much more than the subscription price for this app. You can tell the developers really listen to user feedback, and the whole app experience is just great."
5,Lizzy405,I‚Äôve tried a few similar apps but so far this is my favorite. Easy to use while still able to track a lot of different things.
1,Brillianteden,"Bearable could be great app, but they won‚Äôt listen to users about designing gen flaws that make it unusable. I couldn‚Äôt remember whether I signed in with Google or email and password and am now stuck on the privacy agreement page. The app doesn‚Äôt reset to the login/Home Screen on force quitting or even on uninstall! I can‚Äôt use it, and I can‚Äôt get past the gatekeeper who doesn‚Äôt understand the problem."
5,Abcd28!,Excellent for tracking lifestyle and symptoms. It is especially helpful with tracking my auto immune issues. I highly recommend it. I am also very grateful it is affordable.
5,CoryJames17,This app has so many neat features yet it is very user friendly. I‚Äôve been looking for an app to track my medications and symptoms. I have a chronic health condition and this app is ideal for my needs.
5,shannonvond,I suffer from a chronic illness and have always struggled to track everything to look for patterns and/or share with my medical team. This one actually does everything I need it to. Totally worth it.
1,dbzlo,"Lists itself with no price so you download it (giving them info on your device). Then require your email address, prompt to connect with health data apps, and collect information specific to your goals before finally prompting you for a 7 day free trail. If you back out you get no service from the app and they get no money but they do walk away with a LOT of very personal information."
5,SaraMichelleB,I recently switched from a symptom trackers app. I love this app! It‚Äôs so easy to use and incredibly customizable in what you can track! I feel way more motivated actually log symptoms now. I highly recommend it
5,Snow_Angel_,I CANNOT recommend this app enough.  This is an absolute game changer as a chronically ill person trying to just live and hold a full time job. I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep up with their mood or physical symptoms.
5,Broadwaygal93,This has helped so much. Love the symptom pattern recognition I‚Äôve been doing this manually for years. Wish it had a widget for the home screen though. Thats my only complaint.
5,MegsHealthJ,"So helpful to track allll the things in one place. Seriously such a relief to be able to put the good, the bad, and the ugly all on one app whenever I need so I can reference when needed. Highly recommend."
5,globitz,"This is exactly what I‚Äôve been wanting for years. So excited that a talented team built it right! Extensible, customizable, intuitive, and cute to boot. A+ to whoever came up with the name."
5,Small fry ali,Get this app and actually use it if you want to find patterns that directly link how you treat yourself and how you feel. Very insightful information you can find out about yourself.
5,Kdaniels8000,Finally a tracker that does everything and it does the main thing which is track pain. I‚Äôm happy about it. Please do not get rid of this app and also I have to tap the app twice to get it to open.
4,Morgan_730,The #1 best app for people who need to track their health for chronic conditions. Bearable is customizable to your particular new so you only have to track what‚Äôs important to you. The generated insights make it easy to know how to maximize good days and prevent bad ones.
4,CNN_ZeRo_Kewl,My doctor wants to see what foods are making me sick I found this app it‚Äôs amazing besides there‚Äôs no notes section so instead of using one app I‚Äôll have to use two or find another app:/
5,The Omega Necro,Hard to overstate how great this feels to use. I‚Äôve just started and it feels very intuitive and has so many customizable features. Highly recommend.
5,TexasHoya09,"I found this after being diagnosed with POTS. I hade four different apps to track metrics, so amazing to have all of them in one AND show correlations over time!! It does everything!"
5,zsp1234567890,Love it; just hard to track food on multiple apps.  Would be good to Sync with myfitnesspal and other food trackers
4,ResilientSoul,This app is the best. I‚Äôve tried all other similar ones. One suggestion: please make it possible to update the number of meds at hand so user knows when to fill a prescription. Thanks !
5,Oracle at Denny's,"This is the most easy to use, aesthetically pleasing app I have found to track the majority of the things in my life. I‚Äôm already starting to see patterns in my affect and that is such fantastic insight. James is a great guy and responds quickly to even the smallest inquiries."
1,4theKing,"I didn‚Äôt want to subscribe to the premium version but my card information somehow still confirmed the purchase without my desiring to do so. I am disappointed and upset that there is no reversal or refund, which I think is a MAJOR FLAW in this app. I want to use this app for my health, but this turn of events has made me VERY upset with the company and makes me not want to use it anymore."
2,reviewbug422,Every time I add something the app freezes and I have to close it and go back in to use it. Probably won‚Äôt buy this if that isn‚Äôt fixed because this takes a long time to begin with so add in this bug and it becomes very frustrating.   This app would be great (4+) if this bug was fixed.
5,itsabandjoke,This app is perfect for tracking my health and my progress with my moods and anxiety. It‚Äôs customizable exactly in the ways I need and has been a big help to me- I use it every day!!!
2,stars_rainbow,I haven‚Äôt even set up my account fully yet and I already dislike how this app acts. It asks questions like what symptoms currently bother me the most but I can only pick two‚Ä¶ I have 5 debilitating illnesses that take up more space than two symptoms.. pls fix that.
5,Dippin Pippin,This app is ANAZING! So many features and I‚Äôm still on the free version. This has helped my physical and mental health so so much. I‚Äôm suggesting this app to everyone I know. Especially if you are chronically I‚Äôll and/or disabled.
5,stephceleste2001,I would like it if this app fit the screen of the iPad. I want this app to be able to login across multiple devices.
5,Robsberta,"Some times I wish there were some other ways of imputing information, but I really like all the options and how the app is."
5,MT Broken Man,I have gone through many ‚Äúhealth tracking‚Äù apps and this one is by far the best I‚Äôve ever used. The power to customize and filter and run reports is spectacular! I LOVE this app.
5,Rebobnai,Bearable has helped me identify my triggers and teach me to be aware of my daily health practices. This app has been recommended by my health coach and has been invaluable to me as a continue to recover from long covid.
5,SassyCarolyn,"This app puts everything in one place. As someone living with mental health challenges and ADHD being able to notice patterns in sleep, eating, and mood is a huge deal. It‚Äôs easy to navigate and easily customizable to your needs."
5,nycbone,"There are a great base of options to start tracking your health well. Then you realize just how customizable this bear is, helping you track any condition you are experiencing. ü§ç‚òëÔ∏è"
3,jo4886,I just got an email stating they are paying $50 for the top 3 reviews. So any positive reviews you should take with a grain of salt. I find this to be very sketchy marketing and offensive.  It‚Äôs too bad because the app itself is fine but I now have a bad taste in my mouth for the entire company.
5,PZ1717,This app is amazing! It‚Äôs been a game changer for my drs appts. It‚Äôs wonderful to have data to show progression of symptoms and to track effects on my health. My drs are now recommending it to other patients!
3,lauranceisarat,"I like this app, it helps me track my fainting and my joint pain but this app doesnt do much unless you pay for it! most of us disabled folks have a hard time getting extra money due to our conditions anyway so this app is sort of useless."
1,therealpublicist,"Not sure what‚Äôs going on with the app, but the entire purpose of me getting this was medication reminders. I‚Äôve double checked all the settings and everything is set up and all the permissions are enabled. Still have not gotten one notification reminder. Will not buy again until this is fixed."
5,Cory Gildersleeve,App is really cool and it allows for a safe and effective way to talk about certain things going on in your life. Would recommend to many people.
5,Ergarner82,This app has been good. It has all the features I need in one app. It has helped me to be more consistent in my data logging. Love it!
4,FrannyJM,I have Lupus and it has been hard to keep track of my symptoms. Not only does this app keep track of it. It also shows you trends. Helps you take control of your chronic illness. I love this app.
4,Mckinzie G,I‚Äôm very happy my therapist recommended me this app. I‚Äôm 19 and have an autoimmune disorder and mental health issues and I tend to just ignore my symptoms and deal with it but it is nice that I can review my progress and aim for positive goals. Just give it a try!
5,Amv186,I love this app. Once you play with it the app is super easy to use. I am more mindful of what triggers my mood swings. Bye bye caffeine (and I wish work üôÑ). Thank you for helping me help myself!
1,JuniperMarie,"I‚Äôve been trying multiple apps to track food, symptoms, and medications. This one seemed like it had all these features but it doesn‚Äôt let you track basics like protein, fat, and carb intake.   It has all these weird things to add to the foods, like high sodium, high protein, little eaten, etc. but nothing that makes it easy to track actual meals and correlation to symptoms."
5,emberremembers,"I love this app for all my health tracking needs, it‚Äôs quick to input everything and is very helpful to bring to my doctor"
5,jogaun,The fact of making the daily observations has been quietly transformative. It‚Äôs brought my habits from subconscious to conscious. I love how customizable everything is.
1,kaymeko,"It‚Äôs a waist of time unless your gonna pay for premium, it would probably be good for someone with a lot of stress, anxiety, or just any mental issues, and physical to a point, but if your Simone what average it‚Äôs a waist of money, you could get a price of paper and write what you ate, your sleep schedule, and social life and it would work better than this app without premium"
4,Tad and Son,I think bearable gives you plenty of options to score your health and wellness. I find it helpful especially to see that overall my depression and anxiety symptoms have reduced.
2,Reviewing_Stuff4U,"The app claims apple health integration. It actually only imports 5 or so metrics. There is no way to integrate any nutritional data at all and exercise data is only total step count and average heart rate for the entire day. Without better apple health integration, it involves a LOT of re-entering data that‚Äôs is already on my phone."
5,MatthiasIam,"This app is awesome. The one thing I needed that was missing, I emailed the devs about and a month later it was in the app. That‚Äôs incredible and I‚Äôm extremely grateful."
5,Cat And Kids Lover,it has everything i could want in this app for free and i am happy to donate since they care about your health utilities and not just your money. this app is genius and one of my best mental and physical health tracking resources.  SUGGESTION: if this app was available for apple watch users could more easily track things just from their watch  thank you for your hard work
1,dibmembrane,The app is actually really helpful but the steep cost and short trial time really screwed me. I was in and out of the hospital and my stepsister downloaded it for me to help with my CHF symptoms‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt able to keep track of cancelling it and im out my money. I was unable to get a refund. Really steep cost for a time where everything counts. Wish someone could help
4,Huntress-Wizard,"I seriously love this app but I really want them to improve the nutrition area. It would be awesome if it could track time of day you‚Äôre eating, calories, nutrition, etc. maybe sync with my fitness pal"
5,"iPhone183&-""@","Great ap! Easy to use and I can track things like pollen, mold, food and fatigue for histimine intolerance. Thanks! And love the reminders"
5,worldü•≥,I‚Äôve used this app for 6 months and recommend it to many people! It helped figure out my diagnosis and track it
5,Beccahaddick,"With Bipolar 1, ADHD, anxiety, and depression, this app has made it extremely easy to know, for myself, what to tell my mental health providers regarding my care‚Äîwhat will help me, going forward."
4,GreendreamsTX,"I love this app. I‚Äôm happy to pay for it.  The flexibility and customizable permits me to record my medications and PT efforts. I can also record my wellness aspirations and notice my health triggers, too.  I would love Apple Watch integration. At the minimum, push reminders would be fabulous. Ideally, I‚Äôd also like to be able to record healthy activities like meds and factors from my watch. Analytics and edits could remain phone only.  Thanks for such a helpful wellness tool!"
5,theoptimisticpeanut,I use it to track my severe PTSD and my partner for their cancer. Its incredibleq for people with chronic illnesses and tracks more than your mood.
5,sallyhdhdjfjfkfjfkfkfk,everything you need to monitor all in one app! couldn‚Äôt ask for a better tool in improving my health!
5,legar612,"Once I figured out how to make this work for me, it became transformative in my healing journey. Highly recommend."
5,SirTrixaLot,I've downloaded many apps like this and this is by far the most beautiful one
5,Angela P writer,I‚Äôve tried a lot of apps to track my health/mental health but this one by far takes it as the best. I love this app so much
5,michaelpmason,"This is a very intuitive and user friendly app that helps me track nootropics to mood, sleep quality and other factors. Eager to see it further developed."
5,pyrorckt,"Bearable is well executed and intuitive to use. When I needed support, I received a prompt and friendly response."
3,annacraft3466,When you try to edit your symptoms and you hit save it deletes them entirely. Did not bother to continue using the app when u couldn‚Äôt set it up so the rest of it might be fine‚Ä¶
5,@CabeAmornaMochila,I just downloaded it but I know already this is the best app to track your health!
1,thistletan,"Asks lots of personal information not covered by HIPAA when installing.  Requires an account and after about 10 min of setup asks you for a monthly fee.  Free version of the app looks like it does anything useful.  id much rather be able to install and use basic functions of the app, without a lot of questions, and pay if i found it useful.  they waste your time so you feel invested and then hit you with a fee.  All the usual sleazy marketing ploys - (would a cute little bear rip you off?)  dont waste your time."
5,Jaymin W,This is amazing I‚Äôm big in the idea of the quantified self and this is the perfect app for tracking the information I need. Really great work on this.
5,Kate üò§,So good! I wish that you guys had a widget though. Please make them
5,edimi0711,i‚Äôve been using bearable for over a year and it‚Äôs a great way to keep track of my symptoms and keep an eye on trends. my only request would be to add a feature where we can upload photos in the notes section that way we can record if one of our symptoms is visibly worse than usual.
5,Anonymous913036,All the details and logging can be overwhelming at first but stick with it. Once you get going this app is amazing. The perfect mood tracker.
5,Pixie12345678,"This is literally the best app outthere for people with any chronic illnesses. I love the organization, the lovely lay outs, the ease of use and the ability to add your own symptoms, factors etc. Seriously it's the best app fo tracking illnesses."
5,Delanie1313,My brain is so small with narcolepsy so tiny and this app makes doctors visits so much easier
1,RainyThatsMe,Can‚Äôt create an account if the keyboard doesn‚Äôt pop up when you try and type in a password. Why tell me to contact you again. I‚Äôve reported it either fix it or don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not going to spend my time holding your hand to support your app.
1,J9ssica,"I tried two different email accounts and the confirmation emails never came. Can‚Äôt even sign in without confirming. I am choosing to use my email instead of the Apple, Google, or Facebook log in.  Never had this issue with any other apps."
5,ahmzlowaz,This is exactly what I was looking for! Makes tracking symptoms so rewarding and easy!
5,ThisIsTheB,Love the app so much. It's made tracking symptoms easy. The data output is also great and easy to understand.
5,VeronicaWeinschreider,"I have BPD and ADHD and I‚Äôve been lost in binders, notebooks and homemade mood charts for years to be able to track/learn my habits and triggers. This app has it ALL and more. Get it."
5,Jules2526,I‚Äôm on the free trial right now and will 100% be paying for the app.   Reasons I love:  1. This is so helpful for keeping track of things and how they affect me. Great tool for mindfulness and helping me chart what affects my anxiety.  2. SUPER user friendly 3. Customization!! I LOVE customization and this app is perfect for adjusting how I need it
1,AddyMM,"Besides the ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù feature, if you go with free app it seems to go based off inky what you put in the intake forms. Wasnt able to change or add symptoms which defeats the purpose of the app. My symptoms are all over the place so if I can only pick from limited choices theres no point."
1,uhauljoe,"Thought it was because I do betas, but even when I'm on a public release, it just crashes on startup.   I have reinstalled countless times and it only ever crashes.   Really really disappointing."
3,TeeDot12,"‚Ä¶but I need more than that, to track as needed medications AND their effectiveness."
5,Fede_7,"Bearable is so awesome!!!  So intuitive, clear, complete, useful, customizable and beautiful!! It truly stands out as the best mood, symptom, and factor tracking app!!"
5,Debbi J.,"This app is very good. It‚Äôs only the 3rd day I‚Äôve had it but it covers so much of your physical, mental and emotional health that I‚Äôm impressed."
5,zoetrphe,I was impressed with the ease to operate and the sense of accountability and motivation it invokes. I highly recommend.
5,GenerousOctopus,Easy to use has practically everything you could want.
4,Spitefullime,"So I can‚Äôt give a great review yet, but please please add an option for water in liters. I drink 3 liters a day at least and it‚Äôs easier for me"
2,alexr194567,Love this app but it doesn‚Äôt have a menstrual cycle tracker and that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Not sure why it has menstrual symptoms tracking but nowhere to track your cycle days. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to have to use another menstrual cycle app.
5,lilsgraces,"i was recently hit by a car‚Ä¶ would not recommend. anyway, my mental and physical health have been at lows, and i was looking for a way to track how i‚Äôm doing and how my habits affect my health. this app has been perfect for that, i love it so much!"
4,designerjake,Crashes the first time I open. Every time. But works on the second try. Tracking for medical reasons. Keeping notes for journaling.
5,sssssarah,Trying to maintain my weight while on Wegovy and correlating symptoms and dosage is easy with this app. It‚Äôs so informative
5,saucisquip,I think my favourite part about bearable is the experiments tab.
2,someone-436749,I really do love this app but the most recent update has made it not good for me anymore. i don‚Äôt like that in the factors section it‚Äôs about times instead of just the normal what you did.
2,Oliver773134,Makes you fill in numerous personal details and once it‚Äôs all done it finally tells you the pricing (which is high). It should tell me the pricing at the beginning.
3,Aaa336777,I love this app but as of yesterday I can‚Äôt open it anymore. It just stays on the loading screen forever.
4,Tonydakickboxer,Very good app. I give it four stars because it doesn‚Äôt show properly on iPad.
3,PhishyMama,Not good for tracking multiple pain areas.
5,Da best Chica ever!!!!,I love the insights. I also love that you can customize symptoms.
5,LesyaGTC,Easy to track custom made symptoms.
5,Chawitte,Have been absolutely loving this app. It‚Äôs extremely useful for someone with undiagnosed chronic illness(es).
5,bouncingbabyboy,I‚Äôm using this to manage emotional issues and try to develop good habits. It‚Äôs super user friendly and in depth.
1,sibDod,I only wanted to try the free trial to see if I liked the app. I knew within 3-4 days that it isn‚Äôt for me. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to cancel before I got billed. I email them‚Ä¶.nothing. Then BAM! I‚Äôm charged for the year subscription.
5,Ivyjane420,"Very helpful and insightful, I ended up purchasing premium!"
5,Bea47Carlton,I appreciate the customization
5,Bellamichellea,"I never write reviews when they ask for it. I‚Äôm sick. I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to write reviews. If you‚Äôre here reading this review, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre in the same boat. You‚Äôre sick too. You are weak and tired too. You don‚Äôt have time or energy. But this app is incredible. It doesn‚Äôt take time. It saves time. It makes time. It makes joy. It makes ease. It makes me smile. It has a bear on it. Trust me. It‚Äôs well executed and brilliantly thought out, even the free version which is what I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôve used it for a week and even with my cognitive impairments it‚Äôs incredibly intuitive and easy to use. I LOVE it. Genuinely. It‚Äôs so easy to use, to customize and personalize, to track, to make your own for any and all your health needs. I‚Äôve shown it to everyone. In one week it‚Äôs made all 3 of my doctors appointments go so much smoother. It‚Äôs made taking and tracking all 15 daily medications go by so much easier. Tracking my food too to make sure I eat despite forgetting and the nausea and the appetite being gone. It has the ability to remind you to do things. Take medicine for example. Tracking my many symptoms too. Even the little gratitude tracker is a nice bonus. And the mood tracker is a nice bonus to have me consciously think about how I‚Äôm feeling emotionally not just physically. All of it is brilliant. I love that I can add in my own symptoms and my own emotions, for when I feel ennui or emotionally energized or on fire or proud, or symptoms like ‚Äòsenility‚Äô or other things that don‚Äôt come pre-set. It‚Äôs all just so incredible and I could go on and on. I wish I could pay for it to use all its goodness but the free version is nice too. Just to track what I do. Do yourself a favor and just download this, if there‚Äôs anything at all up with your health. Yeah, just do it. Make yourself beary happy."
5,cmclarke90,I‚Äôm really enjoying the gamification of discipline and new insights on correlations between my behaviors.
5,Awaller1990,"Very customizable, easy to use, with a pleasing UI"
4,Mumzyboo,No watch app. I totally miss the mood update reminders as a result. But I love the app!! Just would like more accessibility
1,Jenlwren03,"I tried to sign up via email, but the keyboard would not come up to input a password.  Definitely not a good start!  Could not even copy/paste a password in."
1,„Ç´„Ç∫„ÉèÔºÅ,"The most disgusting, unholy example of a modern 2023 subscription based app gone wrong. Main feature of this app (correlation based ‚Äúinsights‚Äù) can‚Äôt even be used without paying. Every nook and cranny filled with nagware, ‚ÄúUpgrade now!‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet pro‚Äù! Ewwww."
5,hailey b 611,Really customizable and thorough even the free version
5,EvieK( ‚ó†‚Äø‚ó† ),"it's the BEST mood tracker out there. comprehensive, beautiful, i just adore it."
5,Marrzia,So in depth. An easy way to figure out your body!
1,daringindeed,"I was charged for a 7-day free trial. I signed up on December 14 and cancelled on day 7, December 21 and was still charged. If it‚Äôs a 7 day free trial, should I not be charged on the 8th day??? I am not happy at all and do not recommend this app at all. Not a happy customer. Buyer beware."
4,@katiemowery,"If you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôre dealing with health problems, you‚Äôre probably doing so many things all at once just to see if something helps and find some relief. Medications, exercise, therapy, fill in the blank. And then you experience a setback and you think ‚ÄúAre any of the things I‚Äôm doing even helping? Am I making any progress?‚Äù This app takes care of that for you. The premium version is so customizable. You can input any habit, activity, symptom, medication, etc. that you want. And the automatic correlations that the app finds between your habits and outcomes is so helpful. I‚Äôve only been using the app for two weeks, and I can already see that when I go for walks, my weird leg pain improves. So that motivates me to go for more walks. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have figured that out on my own because there are just so many variables that go into my day. It‚Äôs just little things like that, and having that knowledge, that makes a huge difference in your health journey. I‚Äôm withholding one star because wish I could track my cycle. I manually created factors for each phase of the cycle, but I wish it was a built in feature. Our hormones really have a huge impact on every aspect of our life, and it would help me and a lot of women to have that data. And it‚Äôs something we could easily show our GYN too for them to be able to say ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs normal,‚Äù or ‚Äúyou get extremely depressed when you‚Äôre menstruating, that‚Äôs not healthy and we need to look into that.‚Äù But other than that I love the app and know that it‚Äôs going to be very beneficial the more I use it."
5,LSunshineO,This app is amazing and I highly recommend it!
5,JuneBear16,this is a great way to track your sleep and mental health. it also has things like experiments you can do on yourself to better yourself and your life
1,Thouson,"I can see this has a lot of potential, but it‚Äôs way too complicated for most users(even for me). 1/10 not customer friendly."
1,TeamSpacer,"Useless without menstrual cycle tracking. Need ability to see days since start of last period, phase, and ability to correlate factors to the phase"
5,üêåüíóüê¢,"Simple, insightful, and highly customizable."
3,Alex Tylos,Great app tracks everything I need it to.   I would love to see:  Siri shortcut integration.  Home Screen widget.  A full blown iPad version would be great but if I could get the ability to dock it on the side of my journaling app it would make my workflow so much better.  The ability to add handwritten notes using an Apple Pencil.
1,Josiah109,"Download the app, bombarded with subscription fees. All text in the app is extremely wordy. The UI is unintuitive. Other buttons overlap with the buttons I actually want to press. Unusable."
5,Maddyy!!!!!,This app is the app to delete all other apps. Love it
4,zzzzzzzzzzzüò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥,"Great! Cute app, but a little complicated. Still one of my fav self care apps!!"
1,itsbridj,"I find it misleading when apps are ‚ÄúFree‚Äù but then you get through the initial set up and it‚Äôs actually a Free 7 day trial, not really free. Nothing about it is free. I think that should be in the info up front."
4,Left0verture,"I‚Äôve scoured the appstore and tried numerous apps for health and symptom tracking - I can‚Äôt find anything better than Bearable. The dev is responsive and releases frequent tweaks, fixes and upgrades. Privacy is a cornerstone - if you think about it, you probably DON‚ÄôT want an app scraping your most personal info and selling it to the highest bidder, right? Bearable is free to download but to really use it isn‚Äôt free - most apps these days aren‚Äôt - but the subscription is at least reasonable. Some similar apps do MUCH less and cost MUCH more. (Gyroscope, I‚Äôm looking at YOU.) Nothing is really free, but hey, I like to be paid for my work and I assume devs do as well. FWIW, I loathe subscriptions, but Bearable is one of the very few that I renew with no hesitation. Bearable is comprehensive and flexible - you can add or remove almost anything and track it according to frequency, intensity and quantity. You can hide stuff but keep it in the database - for example, if your allergies tend to flare up in the spring and fall but not the rest of the year, you can hide the entry from the main input screen and limit the clutter. I haven‚Äôt really figured out the data manipulation part yet - the app apparently does all kinds of data gymnastics, but I haven‚Äôt wrapped my head around that part. Bearable is unfortunately currently only available for iPhone. I‚Äôm not as young as I used to be - my eyes aren‚Äôt the best and I have sausages for fingers. find the small screen clumsy and unfriendly for graphs, charts and comparisons. I‚Äôd really like to see a native (landscape!) iPad app that would either sync via iCloud or allow data export/import from iPhone. Finally, while you can manually enter weather data, it would also be great to have the app automatically sync local temp, cloud cover, humidity, etc. in the same way that Bearable can already collect blood pressure, weight and such from HealthKit. Bottom line: it‚Äôs closer to perfect than any other app I‚Äôve tried in this category or any other tracker I‚Äôve tried to wrangle into working."
3,Mehhem,"I love the idea, but outside of the cookie cutter ideas it‚Äôs hard to setup."
1,Leapfrog83,I had this app for less than 5 min before deleting it. It doesn‚Äôt tell you how you use it.
3,JoshuaSterling,"App would be more helpful if it allowed pain to be measured on a 1-10 scale, not 1-4. Most Doctors and hospitals use a 1-10 scale."
1,mel2cool4u,Have to pay to use it after 7 day trial wish it said that up front before I gave them all my info ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,nursnan,Very helpful in seeing trends in my Long Covid.
3,Great Sleep 2023,I‚Äôm still not sure how to use this for the greatest benefits.
3,River 555,"This app could have been phenomenal, but there are too many glitches that make me not trust the results. I have spent a lot of time these past few days inputting all my foods and symptoms. Since I was intending to spend a lot of time each week doing this, I wanted to make sure the app was reliable, so I did a few experiments. For example, if you go back in time and delete a specific food from a previous day, then at the bottom of the Insights page, where the factors are listed, the little number in the upper right hand corner of that food factor does not get updated. Like, let‚Äôs say there were previously four instances of that food and you reduce it to three, there is still a tiny ‚Äúfour‚Äú attached that food. And yet it does delete it from the day where you deleted it. Then if you look at the impact that food has on your sleep, the percentage of ‚Äúeffect‚Äú does change a bit (As it should) compared to when you had 4 instances of that food but what‚Äôs weird and really bad is that if you then create an imaginary food (just for the sake of this experiment) and you put it on the exact same three days as this first food you just tested, the results are not the same, whereas they should be. Since there are three instances of these two foods and they are on the exact same three days at exactly the same time, and the only difference between them is that the first food was reduced from 3 to 4 instances and the second food was logged in as three instances from scratch with no corrections, the results should be the same. But they‚Äôre not. So why should I trust the results in general? If the results are not trustworthy, this is a huge problem, and this is a very important glitch that should be fixed. I really hope that you will fix it because other than its inaccuracy and unreliability it‚Äôs a truly phenomenal app with the potential to improve peoples‚Äô lives immeasurably. (FYI: I‚Äôm using this app on an Apple iPhone)."
5,Ishymyfishy,Great app. Super thorough and easy to customize.
5,Nat Liz,100% recommend this for anyone struggling with chronic illness
5,hhdbxbdbxndbxbbdxb,I love this app it is AMAZING ot helped me get my feelings out
5,Sarahhhhhhxx,completely worth the money as someone with chronic health issues :) amazing!
2,vbjkmooytrewafgxxxv,Doesn‚Äôt  print out so it‚Äôs worthless to meBc can‚Äôt get to my Dr
1,perhaps a coa,I want to see all symptoms entered on the calendars during a time period. You can only select specific symptoms

5,Wasted money!!,"I have tried various apps to track different health concerns throughout the past 10 years or so, and this is the most comprehensive app that I‚Äôve used. I love the detail that they put in the data options for each different ‚Äútopic‚Äù. A great example of that is the bowl movement section. They provide different stool types to chose from, with a ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù image of each type, and they even provide the options in order from hardest to softest types, with a description too. You can also choose common notes, such as the urgency and difficulty, and others. Plus, you can add your own notes to each topic. So when I changed my diet to include more oatmeal, or more exercise, I noted how those affected my digestive system. It‚Äôs as if they took the concerns and medically helpful suggestions and included them in each topic that they provide for you to track.  Other things that I, personally, use the app for right now are my possible MS symptoms, such as tingling in my hands and feet, exhaustion, and mental focus, just to name a few. But I also track headaches, tired days, nutrition (general, I don‚Äôt track exactly what I ate and how much, etc. But I can note specifics when I desire, such as consuming a food that is high in a certain nutrient.)  There‚Äôs a lot more that I‚Äôm not thinking of right now.  I have pretty high expectations for the abilities of an app, and this is one that I felt like is worth taking the time to right a detailed review. I hope that it is helpful to others."
5,thecailleach,"the best meds, symptom, & mood tracker! it‚Äôs so pretty and it functions really well. i was in desperate need of an app like this and i‚Äôm so impressed"
5,JJMK27,"In the process of trying to tend to multiple overlapping short- and long- term physical and mental health matters, including a challenging diagnostic path for a possible rare genetic condition, I realized that keeping a notes file with general observations wasn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. It became abundantly clear that I‚Äôm going to need much more granular data to not only help parse my complicated presentation, but also to advocate for myself with providers and insurance. I researched multiple health and lifestyle tracking apps before landing on Bearable and giving it a trial week. I didn‚Äôt need a week, though ‚Äî It was clear on the same day that I downloaded it that it was a keeper.   Bearable offers a flexible system for tracking not just symptoms but a whole range of lifestyle factors that influence wellbeing. Its default set-up is pretty robust to start with and may serve many users well without much tweaking. That said, it was super easy and intuitive to use its defaults as a jumping off point for adding custom factors to track (i.e. very specific symptoms such as left hand tingling/numbness vs right, and daily activities specific to my life, like how much VR headset use).   After you get a few days logged, the app starts to provide correlations between the tracked items. While correlation isn‚Äôt causation, seeing these connections offers plenty of insight to allow for greater self-awareness and to help guide inquiries to providers. In under a week it has given me new awareness of some semi-regular activities that appear to positively impact my mental health, so now I can explore the connection intentionally. Never would have put two and two together on my own.   Perhaps the best part is discovering how much the (small!) Bearable team works with its users to make further developments. Multiple platforms exist to interact with the community of Bearable users and the creators, where requests and ideas are shared and bounced back and forth with the creators as they make developments. I‚Äôve never seen a company walk the talk SO thoroughly on their commitment to being user driven.   This might be a weirdly long and effusive review üòÖ, but it‚Äôs impacted me that much.  Thank you so much, Bearable team. Your app, and your palpable care, have given me a practice tool *and* a dash of empowerment and optimism about my own health. üíó"
4,Zstatisticort,"Super awesome, but please add an Apple Watch app!"
4,BearableUser,Bearable is awesome to keep track of mental health. Wish the app had a cool WIDGET!!
1,Yodidid,I cant find where to unsubscribe and nobody will help when I call
5,Uhaulmyass,"Does keto affect my sleep?  How is my mood affected by hot weather? Am I happier on days when I do yoga, or when I run? Is my new psych med doing its job? Is this supplement actually making a difference? ******* For self improvement addicts like myself or anyone struggling with mental or physical health, Bearable is an AWESOME way to record interventions like new meds and supplements and different activities or exercises to see how they affect energy and happiness on average over the long term.  There can be an awfully confusing matrix of variables playing a role in mental (and physical!) health, from social media to sleep to weather to specific places we go daily and people we see, and Bearable lets you track ALL of these. You just type them in and the app works in the background making associations (‚Äòinsights‚Äô) for you over time and showing you patterns you might not otherwise see.  They have truly thought of everything - and anything else you think of, you can add yourself! Every category is customizable - you can both add options and take away ones you don‚Äôt use.   For instance I added Sugar Cravings to my Symptoms list and was able to see I have Fatigue 100% of the time I have sugar cravings. This is not surprising but it‚Äôs a great reminder to see in black and white that when my brain says chocolate, what I really need is a nap.  I haven‚Äôt even grazed the real depths of what this app can do in my first month using it and I look forward to exploring more of its capabilities and insights.   I can‚Äôt think of any condition this app wouldn‚Äôt be super helpful for - weight control, depression, PMDD, anxiety, addiction recovery, migraines, chronic fatigue - and it‚Äôs great at keeping everything in one face with a fun, friendly, motivating user interface.   I just want to say THANK YOU to the developers. I have dreamed of an app like Bearable for as long as there have been apps. I‚Äôve used various trackers to monitor mood, health factors and habits for years but I can bring everything under one roof now."
4,smememeyes,"This app is ALMOST perfect. I use it to track things like productivity, mood, health, and energy so i can better understand what habits or routines I need to change in order to manage my ADHD, IBS, etc.  HOWEVER, because one of my primary symptoms is executive disfunction I have a hard time pushing myself to open the app everyday, throughout the day, go down the list, recall my symptoms + factors, and record them. I have two notes for developers that would make Bearable more friendly to those of us who struggle with executive disfunction and probably more usable for people in the long term.  1.) Home Screen or Lock Screen WIDGETS where you can quickly record energy levels, fatigue, productivity, mood, etc. in real time without having to track down the app on your Home Screen.  2.) APPLE WATCH APP?? My phone isn‚Äôt always on me and i avoid using it during the day as it leads to distraction. But my watch is always on my wrist and if I‚Äôm feeling low or have a sudden onslaught of dread etc. it would be nice to just click my wrist and record that. Oftentimes, I‚Äôm feeling off but never end up recording that in Bearable because I either forget I felt that way or I‚Äôm too fatigued to go through the motions of doing it on my phone.  I currently use another app to do this on my watch but it doesn‚Äôt track as much as Bearable and the data aren‚Äôt as informative, but I‚Äôm a lot more inclined to use it just for the convenience.  My partner is a software engineer and said he could program it for you üòÖ But I trust you have your own people to do that!  THANK YOU!!"
3,Kennedy Orange,"I LOVE this app!!! It has seriously made keeping track of my laundry list of health problems so much easier. It‚Äôs also helped me improve other areas of my life that I didn‚Äôt anticipate when I first downloaded the app, I feel so much more aware and on track with the things in my day to day life. My lifestyle habits have improved, I am able to keep track of everything my doctors need, and I have found correlations in my habits and health that have made me more aware/able to improve my health! Aside from that, it has taken SO much stress out of my health tracking due to it being easy to use, insightful, and reliable. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve their well being!   The only reasons I gave this app 3 stars are;  1) The app isn‚Äôt the best when you are stuck behind a paywall. After paying, the app is stellar! I just hate subscriptions though and I wish I could pay once and be done with it. I don‚Äôt mind paying to support the creators of such a great app, it‚Äôs just not ideal that I am going to need to budget over $30+ for this for years. Considering that it‚Äôs a yearly payment instead of a monthly, that does help! However, as a girl on a tight budget, it‚Äôs not the easiest for me.   2) This app doesn‚Äôt include menstrual cycle tracking, which would be SOOOO incredibly useful! My cycle/hormones have a BIG affect on my other health problems. It‚Äôs hard to keep track of the correlations between my health problems and where I am at in my cycle, and it would save me a lot of time if Bearable had a cycle tracking section that could show insights and correlations to/with everything else I track in the app. I use Stardust instead for cycle tracking (awesome app btw) but it is time consuming and somewhat difficult to go through each app and dig through entires to find correlations. I would feel much better about paying for this app if it included cycle tracking (especially since it affects around 50% of the populations health)."
3,ohmegan,"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a tracking app that combines rich app-generated insights with maximum user customizability. Bearable nails the first; their analysis is comprehensive and user-friendly‚Äîthough without the ability to share or export insights, they hinder users‚Äô ability to maximize the usefulness of those insights.    Bearable is also great at building in the ability for users to customize *what* they track. Where the app falls short on user customization though is in *how* we track. This includes customizing the mood scale, colors, rating levels (none-unbearable), whether a factor is considered positive or negative in the analysis, and whether it makes sense for a symptom or factor to have multiple ratings/day or have it apply to the whole day (e.g., a symptom like acne or a factor like ‚Äúout of town‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change 4 times a day).   But these are relatively minor and non-disruptive to tracking compared to my biggest issue here: not being able to modify the time windows on which all tracking is based. (For non-Bearable users, these are 12am-6am, 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, and 6pm-12am.) As a ‚Äúnight owl,‚Äù it feels like a huge chunk of data is missing because the default times assume my day ends at midnight. Including those symptoms or factors in the 12am-6am window for the following day messes with that day‚Äôs average and is inaccurate. I never wake up before 6am, so I never put anything in the ‚Äúpre‚Äù box, meaning I‚Äôm only really tracking 18 hours of the day, with everything that happens from 12am-bedtime completely left out. I‚Äôve considered mentally changing the time windows but that would be incredibly inconvenient for an app I‚Äôm paying a subscription for.   Like most user-submitted suggestions, this has been on the feature roadmap for ages and it‚Äôs unclear whether it‚Äôll ever happen."
5,RunicKai,"This app is very dynamic, and it‚Äôs getting more and more so. You have many options of ways to handle tracking your health. The devs are kind and helpful and so interactive with the community. They ask for feedback on designs and ideas and listen when people ask for certain features.   This is the best health tracking app I‚Äôve come across in my years of searching.   As a minor suggestion for the devs: Since your app‚Äôs strength is how many ways it can be used, there are some little changes that would increase that greatly.   - Allow custom rating systems for symptoms and other things. (e.g 1-10/3-46 or whatever other number scale versus a type in option versus an emoji option etc). You already have all of these features but only certain features can use it (only heath measurements can use type in, only symptoms can use 1-4 etc). If all the features that it makes sense for could be customized as to what they‚Äôre using the app would be much more dynamic.  - Allow us to customize which features we use. (Think strategies/features from Amazing Marvin). This would be become more useful as you add more things so it doesn‚Äôt clutter the homepage of the people who don‚Äôt care for certain features.   This one is more difficult but I think it would help a lot as I know you get complaints about the homepage setup sometimes:  -Allow us to further customize our homepage. I would like to be able to group things together that aren‚Äôt necessarily from the same feature. (e.g. put a health measurement and a factor in the same group, or a symptom and a medication etc. rather than having all factors together and all custom ratings together) This would allow us to create a custom process for logging as well as a design that we personally like."
3,Ricky Tenderkiss,"I saw that Apple Health added the ability to track an assortment of symptoms, and I have the occasional headache or stuffy nose ‚Ä¶ so I went looking for an app which might simplify my ability to record my symptoms to Apple Health.  I suppose what I visualized was my telling the app ‚ÄúOh, I have a headache!‚Äù and the app asking me ‚ÄúHow bad is it?‚Äù and my telling it ‚ÄúMild,‚Äù and the app saying ‚ÄúShall I ask you again in an hour how you‚Äôre feeling?‚Äù and my saying ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and the app waiting an hour and then asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù and my saying ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve been feeling fine for 15 minutes,‚Äù and the app replying ‚ÄúOkay then!‚Äù and recording into Apple Health ‚ÄúHeadache - mild; from 1:10 to 1:55 p.m. on so-and-so date.‚Äù If I was lucky, I thought the app might also record to Apple Health that I‚Äôd taken two acetaminophen.  But mostly I just wanted it to write my symptoms to Apple Health, so that other apps could read them from there, or so that I might include symptoms ‚Äî and their time and date ‚Äî in an overall printout of Apple Health for my doctor, elementary stuff.  This app is not that!! This app is so-o-o-o-oo detailed, like it gets really granular in terms of the things it tracks and charts. If you‚Äôre inclined to record a lot of data into it, I suppose it could help you spot correlations between symptoms and the events surrounding those symptoms. It seems designed for people with truly debilitating chronic illnesses, who may need help narrowing down exactly what‚Äôs making their lives so unlivable.  And it may be great for people with debilitating chronic illness ‚Äî I would not know, I‚Äôm a pretty healthy dude who intended to be a casual user. For me, for what little I needed, this app quickly overwhelmed me ‚Ä¶ and the subscription price, ye cats! For my intended casual level of use, this kind of pricing seems stratospheric. So it may be great for some people, but it‚Äôs not the app for me.  All of that being said, though, I‚Äôm quite surprised it DOES NOT sync symptoms to Apple Health. That‚Äôs quite an oversight. I wish apps which sync with Apple Health were required to specify in their App Store description what info it is exactly that they sync: this would save users lots of time. This app does READ a tremendous amount of info FROM Apple Health, but it does NOT write your symptoms TO Apple Health.  So I give it three stars in terms of its utility to me: it looks like it works, it‚Äôs extraordinarily detailed, it‚Äôs just not what I need right now, and it does NOT do the one thing I‚Äôd hoped it would do. But for you, if you have a life-upending chronic illness, it may be a five-star app or even a six-star app. Luckily for me I‚Äôm in good shape, and to be honest, I hope I continue NOT needing this app.  If the day comes that I do, though, I would still be disappointed if they hadn‚Äôt added the ability to WRITE symptoms TO Apple Health for possible integration with other apps; this seems like the whole point of having a centralized repository of health information!"
5,LizzleBear,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but this app has been so awesome.   It‚Äôs like everything I ever tried to accomplish on a bullet journal, but like digital and with analytics behind it.  It‚Äôs so EASILY customizable for like my own symptoms and my own stuff, and it‚Äôs been so much fun keeping track of stuff. Not to mention the links to the calendar, health, nutrition, reminders, etc. The experiment section is such a bonus.   If you have any mental health stuff and want to see correlations and just learn about yourself and your habits I recommend 100/10. (Yes, I know there‚Äôs an extra 0 üòâ).   I‚Äôm stoked to see what else is developed. Very very beryyyyy insightful app."
5,GothicOverlord,"I found this up about two years ago, I was in search of an app that would allow me to track my moods. Originally I was using paper to track my mood because I kept forgetting. I tried out a few different apps but I didn‚Äôt really like any of them.Then just browsing I found this one.Quite honestly it has helped me so much, Having a mood disorder I can track symptoms andMood changes throughout the day which is helpful for me and my mental health team. I also really love this one because you can use it for both mental and physical health. Plate I use symptom tracker for not only mental health but to track side effects of my medication or of some of the other things I deal with. So I 100% recommend this app, it‚Äôs very user-friendly and easy to learn."
4,Med tracker,I signed up for a trial of premium because I was starting a new medication. The app itself works great but today the trial ended and it charged me 36.30 for the year. I go to look at the app in my subscriptions and apparently there are 11 different pricing brackets for premium. Guessing I didn‚Äôt need this expensive of one but honestly it doesn‚Äôt tell you the difference between features of the brackets so I‚Äôm pretty annoyed. It‚Äôs still only 3 bucks a month billed annually but I find it weird.
5,King the Dog 1369,"The free version is amazing on its own, but I'm a data junkie, so I chose to invest in a year of premium, and I haven't regretted it for a second. The value this app brings is worth every cent. Especially since I got it while it was on sale (which I hear it frequently is) for a very low price.  TL;DR - This app is highly customizable, user friendly, and feature rich. Comes with all kinds of data visualizations, simple AND advanced, for maximum insight without being hard to understand.  Life changing: - Detailed insights allow me to identify triggers, patterns, and other data that can provide insight on my symptoms. I can see who has the most positive impact on my life, which habits are truly serving their purpose, and whether any new medications are actually improving my symptoms. PLUS I can see which symptom management techniques are most effective, what time of day or day of the week I feel worst, and how my symptoms fluctuate over time. And more! - The app provides suggestions for the best ways to manage your symptoms and the worst triggers to avoid, based on data from past logs. You can also input your own symptom management strategies for bad days.  - Built-in (optional) medication tracking and reminders help me stay on top of which meds I take when, and make sure I never miss a day. - Optional nutrition and water tracking also allows you to stay on top of your health and make sure you're meeting your needs. (I don't personally use this feature, but I can think of a thousand ways this could be helpful for other users.)  Practical upsides: - User-friendly and easy to understand. I figured it out and set it up quickly. - VERY customizable to allow the user to measure and track whatever you'd like, going as simple or in depth as your heart desires. - Customizable reminders for the best times of day that work for you. - Simple AND advanced data visualization at any time to best suit your needs. - Low friction; it's so easy and simple to log symptoms that I find myself naturally doing it 5-10 times a day without reminders. Just tap a button and you're golden.  - Community focused developers who take suggestions from the users and work hard to make the app better and better. Public suggestion forum includes information on plans for future changes.  Cons: - Mood is rated on a scale of 1-10 and can be logged as many times per day as you'd like, but other symptoms are rated 0-4 and only up to 4 times per day in time blocks that are not customizable. I personally only care to rate my energy levels in detail, so I was able to work around this by just using the mood tracking section for energy levels instead. But this could be an issue for others. - Due to the small development team, updates and new features may be slow. - Does not currently have a built-in menstrual cycle tracker. (But it may in the future?)  THESE OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I am not being paid or otherwise rewarded to say this."
3,Grippox,"I love what this app does, however a few months ago I switched from android to iOS and there was a major drop off in reliability and performance. The biggest issues so far are that sleep sync only works sporadically, sometimes extra notes disappear, and data export is a mess. Yesterday I wrote a long, significant note early in the day, then later it was gone. I haven‚Äôt figured out a pattern, except it‚Äôs consistently terrible using voice to text. Sometimes sleep sync works fine, sometimes doesn‚Äôt show up for a couple days, sometimes never (tracked using Garmin or Sleep Cycle). Exported data used to come out neat with the android version, but the iOS version exports a disorganized mess with random symbols and missing line/paragraph breaks. This is disappointing as I used to love this app. But still worth 3 stars."
4,Katava,"I really love how much this app tracks and how intuitive the design is. This morning a promo popped up for ‚ÄúFIRST 7 DAYS FREE‚Äù and marked premium subscription down to $18.99/annually. I decided to do it, and quickly after I confirmed the upgrade changed the trial to 3 DAYS FREE! This is why it got minus one star. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great mood tracker. However, I have to decide 24hrs  before March 29th if I will cancel or be charged $18.99. Was it a glitch ? I will never know, but I need to decide quickly if its worth it. I really would have liked 7 days free to make a final decision."
