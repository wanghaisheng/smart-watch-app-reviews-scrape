5,BMW_3,"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this app.  I am typically frustrated by notifications during a busy day because they are usually requests that will take my attention away from what I was focused on.  We live in very distracting times and it’s not uncommon to work very hard all day and somehow end up with a longer to do list by the end of the day.   This app has a way of balancing out those demands and getting a positive or thoughtful quote a few times a day has a way of recentering me and has rewired my immediate assumption that it’s always more work when I get an alert.  This is a very simple idea that is well executed and has had an overall positive impact on my mindset. I love the customization options and the ability to change the tone of the quotes depending on your mood.  Somedays you need a few NSFW quotes to motivate you and sometimes a more introspective quote will plant a seed that changes your perspective on something you are struggling with.    It also has an uncanny way of giving you a quote related to something you were thinking about.  Probably not a coincidence because our phones and technology are always listening and usually trying to figure out how to sell you something, but I am very satisfied with this purchase because it gives me something I find useful and makes me think about something other than what needs to be done throughout the day."
5,Donashello,"So in times where I was feeling down or low in general, this app was very helpful. Sometimes I would look at it whenever I felt like I didn’t know what to do in a situation regarding my life, future, however you may call it….but I can say that this is a good app for anyone who may be drifting through motions of sadness, self-doubt etc. Now there are many quotes here in which I believe were gathered throughout history that many famous & influential people, personalities, individuals across all nationalities, religions etc. who were by societal norms successful and contributed in their own lives in a different manner to their personal circumstances and areas of focus.   Regardless, they still rose above any obstacle that may have encountered in their path because we all need help regardless of how we may view ourselves at any moment. This is just my own personal opinion of what I believe is a very good approach for self care in this regard. Now that’s not to say that there are also many alternatives like books, community, human connection or other social interactions & hobbies to name few. But for those who may have trouble understanding how they might feel in relationships, life, where they may fit in this huge world, isolation along with loneliness and depression can swallow them up but I would like to say that I’m at least thankful for the support and encouragement. Thank you."
5,ArtemisPlatinum,"Huge “Thanks” to the Devs for creating this app! I started out with just the free version to see how much I liked it - and even that was entirely sufficient! However, decided to go Premium when I saw all the additional perks that come along with it - and that I must say is EVEN MORE worth it!You can absolutely create this app and manage it two I help you in all sorts of facets of life the good the bad and sometimes the ugly. Plus, the ability to add teams and then change fonts and then share it with your friends and family membersEither via Facebook or other social media or through a text message, what a great thing to be able to share a positive message with someone. Or better yet what a great thing to be able to find some thing to say to someone when you just don’t have the words to say yourself, just buy clicking one topic in clicking the thousands of quotes available until you find exactly what you want to say!!Not to mention the fact that you can even add your own so if you have a favorite saying of yours that you want to pop up on your widget, then you can put it in the app and time it to come up whenever you want to becauseThey give you the ability to set reminders for clothes whether it be three times a day or minute to minute. This is an awesome app and so grateful for it each and every day. Thanks so much!!!!"
5,panicpoised,"This app has helped me get through so many tough times, setting the reminder is a magnificent tool to help through stressful situations. Whenever I need encouragement to continue living my life and keep a positive mind set, the app throws the perfect quote for the situation in the perfect moment. The staff is wonderful and very compassionate. There isn’t a whole lot I would change about the app. There is one feature I would like to enhance a bit, maybe being able to set specific quotes for certain times during the day, to really drill the most effective quotes that are personal to me in at specific times daily, also being able to have the same variety of quotes notifying me daily too though. Thank you so much I highly recommend this app to anyone trying to be their best version. I love this app and I want the staff to know that they are appreciated as well. Thank you for changing my mindset for the greater good!! ❤️🤟🏻🙏🏻  I typed the above message months ago somehow I didn’t post it, maybe I was fretting being so vulnerable, however it still applies in more ways now. This app is introspective guidance at its finest. Gratitude to this team and all that read this, may your life be full of peace and success of your own way of going. ✌🏻🤟🏻🤘🏻🙏🏻"
3,TBShimmerGirl,"So, I got this app, and I was looking through it and everything. Then I notice that practically everything is locked. I press it to see how to unlock it, and you have to pay. Not for that singular one, but to do basically anything on the app at all, you have to pay either monthly or yearly. A decent amount of money, too. I don’t want to spend money on this app MONTHLY just to unlock quotes that I could easily just search up on google or something instead. There is a lifetime option, but thats nearly 50 dollars. WAY too much for something like this, I’ll say. Being already irritated about this, I then come back to the app store to write a review to find that in the pictures that describe the app, it does NOT say ANYTHING about everything being locked. In the picture, there is no lock symbols. Anywhere. It doesn’t warn you about anything. So basically I just spent a half hour only to find that you have to pay for everything.       In conclusion, for people who like to save their money and not spend it monthly or yearly on an app like this, I suggest just search inspiring quotes up on google, pinterest, or any browser you have. Its easier, and a lot cheaper. Anyway, if the items in this app did not cost so much, it would be a fantastic app to use. Thank you for taking your time to read this, please consider at least lowering the prices or unlocking more options. Have a good day."
5,J Camman,"I very rarely write reviews, for restaurants, apps, services, you name it. Even if it’s pretty good or pretty crappy, I’m just not one to take the time. Unless someone or something has gone way above and beyond to help me or that just blows me away. This app is one of those, originally searching for an app with quotes this one looks nice, simple, easy to look at yet some cool functional tools that don’t over complicate it so I downloaded it and tried the free trial with no intention of actually paying for it by the time it was app. I saw that it was $20 for the year and said no way for quotes? I could just Google them every day. Boy, just after the three days of the trial I would’ve been willing to pay $30. I’m not telling them to raise the price because I would not have paid 30 even then but at this point in time I would. I would love to discuss further opportunities for growth and development with the developers of this app if they’re interested. This app is more than worth the money, it helps me constantly throughout the day and it doesn’t bug are annoying me having notifications, I actually have a tail on my homepage of my iPad and that is perfect, no endless texts but new updates just wanted to hear them."
5,Faith_on_Fire,"I love this app but I love the Valentine's deal even better!  The quotes were unique, I'm a sucker for great inspirational quotes and I have lots of apps for that purpose... But with this Motivation app, I'm surprised to see so many quotes that I wasn't aware of and I love them!   The only thing stopping me from buying a subscription is the price, it's incredibly steep in comparison to my other apps. I don't mind paying for it but not like highway robbery.  If there was more functions, I'd understand but the only great thing about it for me...ok, for me personally... is the great curation of quotes not found in other apps or even places online, one that is convenient and mobile-friendly.    If it was the same market price as with the others, it would have been justifiable. So I just did my copy and paste method in my Evernote to collect the quotes I love manually for a couple of months now.    I'm liking the quotes so much that I decided to try and buy 1 month today (2/9/19), but to my surprise, I saw that they have a Valentine's special for $12 for 1 year ($0.99/a month)!  Now that's what I'm talking about!!!   So I bought it and now I can rate this app high up on the scale and do a review. If you still see the same sale, grab it!!! You won't regret it. I promise."
5,1234$slots,"I have recently been dealing with some hard times in my life. I’ve always been a pretty strong and positive person but there are some things that can just drain a person. Having this app has helped keep me reminded that I am okay. It keeps me centered in reality as my mind can take everything to its absolute worst. It has kept me focused on the things that I can do. I use a couple different apps by this creator and I have to say they are by far the best apps I’ve used in a long while. If you’re in therapy, going through life changing experiences or just having a hard time keeping your mindset on the positive things, then this app is the perfect help! Science has evidence based results showing that keeping your mind on thoughts of positive things can bring you through a difficult phase with a little more ease. I’ve even told my therapist and friends about it! Positive thoughts and energy that are created by using this app 3 times a day becomes a powerful tool in staying connected to yourself and grounded in solutions. I’ve even started using the create your own part of the app to share the positive energy I’ve gained from using it!"
3,Tatiana Perry's Computer,"Quotes can be hit and miss, but most of time helpful. One thing I don’t like about this app is I continuously have to “tap to keep getting reminders”. I’ve noticed lately the notifications will stop coming and not even remind me to tap, tap, tap. Fortunately I don’t get a lot of notifications so I can quickly tell when I need to press on the app to make sure I keep getting these motivational quotes! I’ve also noticed they don’t even come every hour like I scheduled it to. I’ve already paid my subscription for the year so I guess this is something I’ll have to deal with, but I definitely think I will look into using other apps that don’t need me to constantly check to get what I paid for.  Update: I wrote my initial review on Monday and by Friday I got a reminder to keep tapping. i feel like this whole tapping thing once a week can be for people who have the app for free. if i paid for the subscription i shouldn’t have to worry about making sure i get the notifications everyday. if i didn’t ask for them to stop coming then keep sending!  Update #2: Even though I tapped on the notification to keep getting the reminders they still stopped! It’s another Monday and I had to click on the app itself to start it over. I guess it’s better to click on the app itself than click on the notification to be sent to the app. It’s weird."
5,Irisherin95,"This app is apart of my day...literally.   I have it set mornings, afternoon & late evening to give me that little pep talk throughout the day. I am a female business owner, and there are days that can be a little more tough than others. I may doubt myself, or feel like I may never reach my top goals, but every time I see a quote, it lifts my spirits and reminds me that I am doing well.  Whatever self-doubt I can feel sometimes goes away with just a couple of motivation pick-me-ups. Even when I’m having a wonderful day, it gives me that feeling like “Great! I’m amazing!”...I especially like that I can add them to stories on Facebook and Instagram or my Instagram feed to share with others. I have seen people in just the past week REPOST the quote I shared, because it spoke to them & helped brighten their day. That’s the best feeling!!! Yes, it’s awesome to be able to boost my mood, but if it helps others...that makes it totally worth it!  I have had this app for at least 5 or 6 months, and it’s one of the few paid apps I won’t ever cancel.  So, ty!!! This app not only helps those who subscribe, but others as well...maybe they will end up subscribing too!"
5,Camellias.1,"If you practice divination or the type of person who likes or want to receive a message from your spirit guides, God, or any type of spiritual entity. Believe it or not, this is the best app you could ask for in terms of how you receive those messages. At first, I was going to use the app to just get daily motivational boost and be more positive throughout the day but the frequent notifications from the app has been the greatest and best tool for me to get answers from the divines after I have a question about my problems. Even when I have some thoughts or feelings that I wasn’t even hoping to get answers to, I look at my phone after a few hours, and the quotes match perfectly to what I was thinking.  Also, iPhone has an option to add widgets/app information on your Lock Screen and I recommend adding the app because the messages that pop in the widget has been more accurate in terms of how I feel or think throughout the day or week. It could be different for everyone but it’s good to have plus turning the app’s notification on"
3,Tyniceee,"this app caused me no troubles but i’m giving it 3 stars because it just decided to lock majority of the categories for quotes on widgets, i don’t know if it was intentional or just a glitch..but it’s plain stupid. who would download an app that would only give them a pick from 9 different quotes? would i really pick motivation on “Feeling Sassy” than “Encouraging words” because feeling sassy is the only one open on the category anyways. i had picked a certain quote on categories and now it’s locked??? are you serious right neow! i know y’all worked hard and probably needed more money cuz you did that ridiculed thing but me personally, i would rather watch ads than pay just to see some quotes and feel good..and i know when you go to general there is the free today section which you could watch an ad to get it but it’s different when you can only have it today vs the time when i had my faith quote forever..This update is the worst, alteast could’ve left some good quotes unlocked but you did ‘‘em all 🤣 congratulations, cuz i ain’t paying to have what i literally had before and maybe some others agree with this. (not saying this bc im broke) please fix 🙏🏽 i really don’t wanna have to find another motivation app 🥲👋🏽 goodbye."
1,Therealmizkellie,"I have been a paying customer of this app for a while.. paying yearly. all of a sudden 2 months ago, the widget option stopped working for me. Within this time, I’ve been contacting the company trying to figure out the reason this doesn’t work for me anymore. It’s been 2 months & I haven’t had any resolution. The best thing they told me to do is to delete & redownload. Which I would if I didn’t have so many quotes of my own filtering through my app. If I delete & redownload, I will lose all of my customized quotes. The company gave me options to have the app for free for 6 months… I’ve already paid yearly for it. I never seen any money given back to me. & they say that their developers are working on this issue everyday to figure it out. I don’t believe them. No one emails me unless I email them. If I don’t contact them concerning this issue, I’m outta mind (out of site out of mind) As long as they’re getting paid though, right??? & after 2 months, you mean to tell me you still don’t understand why it’s not working??? The only way I see the quotes is if I click into the app. I didn’t purchase this app for that. I gave them until September 1st to figure things out. And it’s September 1st. I believe I will be deleting this app & downloading another app, giving them my money instead bc these developers here do NOT care."
5,DarlingUnique,"I first discovered this simply designed & user-friendly, exquisite and well-developed app quite some time ago. My first thought before even opening the app, was zero faith, and I was preparing myself to be disappointed only because of other “motivational” apps that were unfortunately only created and never truly developed nor built to their full potential. Despite the many hidden, spammy and in-depth file search-remove project. I was VERY impressed with the creator, developer along with the teams work and effort put into creating, building and managing the Motivational Quotes app. One of the top apps I’ve seen to believe, that actually have very inspiring, deep and ‘home-hitting’ quotes that “coincidentally” pop up in your notifications at just the right time, when you needed to hear it the most. Thank you guys for helping me stay strong in my times of weakness. Make sure you clap for all your hard work done, and stop to smell the roses some times! Or things will eventually seem dull, tedious and boring if you don’t. Happy New year, be safe out there!!"
5,Keo07,"This app is nifty, absolutely love it! There are so many great quotes it provides through the day to give me that mental boost. I like how you can customize the categories to suite your needs as well the background art. I also appreciate how you can favorite and create collections of quotes.   The reason I give the app 4/5 stars is due to the fact there isn’t any means to search in the past quotes section for specific quotes you’ve seen so you have a chance to favorite them or whatever. Also, after the last update or so one of my favorite backgrounds was taken away (sort of a black and white scene with trees along a wooded country backroad), would be great to have it back. Maybe a way to create a collection of favorite backgrounds and the ability cycle through them automatically??   Being that this app requires a paid subscription for an otherwise outstanding and useful app, it would be greatly appreciated if the next update or so would take into consideration at improving the previously mentioned issues. Thank you! :)"
5,BrwIGrl86,"App is decent but it could be better. First off, you have to pay for a majority of the stuff and the stuff you don’t pay for requires you to watch a boring add for 30 second. Second off, the topics are limited if you want the free ones. Some of which are free if you watch an ad. Third off, the fonts don’t change much within the topics. Fourthly, the price is high. You should get an option to have a free trial or pay as you go like 99 cents a month. Fifth, some of quotes aren’t really good or they are by people you don’t really know. I could get better quotes from google. The reason why we had the app is either for a potential background or a daily reminder to empower us. Also, it would be nice to choose how it Notified you. If you could pick out how the notifications appear, the sound it makes and if we could share it to friends or social media. So all in all, the app is basic and I’ll prolly keep a few of the quotes but I don’t think I’ll keep the app or tell anyone else about it at least until some things change."
5,gymnastchar,"this app is super simple and I love it so much!! The affirmations are so funky and beautiful like my ex husband… ugh don’t need to reopen that wound. Okay now that I’m venting to random people on the internet looking at this app review I might as well spill all the beans beannsssssssss basically he ditched me for a bowl of ice cream in a construction site bc he said he wanted to rebuild new relationships and I’m like this is not the time for puns.? Anyways, I gave him the twinkle I keep in my hair clip in my purse it was pretty old but he will eat it bc he’s got problems anyways and then I told him, you took out your cousin on a date two weeks after we got married how is this happening? And then this pants fell down and he had broccoli underpants on and the church across the street closed all of their windows at the same day, which I don’t even know how that’s possible. He cried and bought a chimichanga and we ate it in the middle of the road and went to home and watched elf. It was July. And that’s my relationship with my ex husband  Just kidding I’m 17 and I love this app"
5,peachygirl12,"This app was just something I wanted to download for some quotes a couple years ago. Now I have it set to motivate me every other hour throughout my day. At first I just would look for cool things I liked with backgrounds and liked to post the quotes that stood out to me. Now I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, and this app is part of the reason I am alive. I was sitting by the water thinking horrible things and all of a sudden my phone dinged. I had set it away from me so I could just be alone and something told me to check it. I did and the motivation app notification came on my screen. I opened it and the words I read took my breath away. It gave me courage hope and strength to get through another day, and for that I am grateful. Mental health is important. I highly suggest this app to anyone whether your struggling or not it is also amazing for motivation!! Thank you to the creators of this app and hard work that gets put into it, you saved me!"
4,CassandraMariee,"The free version is very good. They have free categories that change daily so you get a chance to see what the premium features offer. I have not tried the premium membership because I don’t have the financial ability to do so thus far.   One problem I just encountered after using the app for about half a year, if you switch or get a new phone the the data (Your collections, your settings, your profile, and your liked quotes) are all GONE. I looked in the FAQ for this app and it warns you about that. This is very disappointing as I’ve been building my collections of favorite quotes, quotes I’d like to share, and quotes I have already shared to people that I’d like to keep for memories are all gone. Why have the collections without being able to keep them with every phone and account?  I hope there’s a remedy to this that I just haven’t found yet or that they are able to bring that option to this app in the future. Anyway, it’s a great app just be careful if you’d want to keep the quotes you save."
5,Ry'Lyn Francis🥀,Recently my father died in March I do not remember the date but I'm am only 10 years old and I thought bc my father laid a rested in a wooden box that there was nothing left to life so I started feeling lots of depression and I felt even more depression when my grandfather died my moms dad my family just suffer so much pain and I didn't understand why so I prayed and prayed hopping god would answer my calls but I never heard back from him in dark u will always find light and my light was the motivation app! It gave me hope and dream something to Believe in! It made me feel so happy every now and then I cry but to relieve pain you have to let your emotions out and don't leave them in a box to relax and relieve u have to let out your emotions and let them work themselves out so I recommend this app because this completely change the way I look at the world now so please download it because I really recommend it because my family and friends and I myself see a big difference!
5,christomlimfan,"Hello! I would’ve put 5 stars instead of 4 but the reason behind it is because there are some of them locked and some of us aren’t allowed to buy things or we don’t have the money for it ! How can we get this app for free and then be expected to be charged ? Some people (including myself) are going through a rough time right now and we need more encouragement! And you don’t know which type of quotes we need to help us push through to the other side ! Please take it into very careful consideration, a lot of people deal with stuff every day and it’s not fair your blocking us from words we need to hear ! 🥺🥺we just want to be happy and it’s almost like you're taking us away from us ! So much for a ,” Great App”, 🙄and the thing is now that we got new Valentine’s quotes and everything , you lock some of the other quotes which is super unfair ???? Who makes new quotes to lock up other ones I hate this app"
5,IGHavanaPatrick,"I know it seems strange that you would enjoy an app like this one so much, yet I’ve only had it a little while and so far it has been promising. You can chose to pay for things like more categories and different backgrounds but if you don’t want to you don’t have to. The motivational messages probably won’t want to make you get up and start a new better life but they do try to make you understand that you life is ok as it is and that positivity can make it better. The massages are also just pleasant to receive during the day depending on when you want the notifications or if you even want notifications. If you like this app then the chances are you might like there other ones so you could go check those out to. Overall just a good app it’s not in your face all the time but just kind of “ hey, I’m here if you need me.” I hope this helped and that you like the app if you download it."
5,MÅŚTÅ MÏXxxxxxxxxxx,"Very excellent, on sync moment to moment , answers to where you are in life when reflected to your daily life when applied , by focusing in the motivational uplifting wisdom and all it takes is one to have the knowledge to realize everything is on time , on notifications it pops up with the amazing timing . A divine essence of syconicity . I suppose you may have to try this app. I only speak from experience in useing notifications set on what I know I need , there’s a variety of topic areas available , when starting the app and available to switch add or subtract areas you like to here from the motivational app. Very well constructed app. Even gives you a moment to write and create deeper statements of wisdom and knowledge in creating on your own from personal experience based on one’s journey. Opens minds , mentality’s as well sparks the passion within to know your never alone , and worth every word written and more . 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 👍🏽"
5,OnPointWithWords,"I love this app, because it definitely helps to keep my mind in a positive place and space. Every day since adding this app, I’ve looked forward to the messages provided that give me much to reflect upon and appreciate. Some apps are much more than a service or amusing form of entertainment, and this one keeps me focused on gratitude and appreciating my day no matter what comes my way! A big shout out to the developers, as I will continue to share thIs app with others who also need some sunshine or a much needed “pick me up” in their lives.   Here’s an original quote from me to you today, “Continue pushing in the face of adversity, own the challenge without fear or explanation in claiming your destiny.” One thought, if you have not considered it already, is to have users send quotes your way for consideration. It can only personalize this app, making it more unique and interactive for all users:)  Peace & Love to all, we need it right now more than ever."
5,I love this game 12345678,Motivation is a fun app but most of all you have to add in your name when you want your motivation quotes to come on and when you want them to end they can and at any time and they can start at any time if you want under start at 1 AM and end at 5 PM then that works out but either way I feel like this will help people slow down anxiety. I’ve had this for a while now and it’s really helped me feel more confident about myself. Even if people are being mean to you this app tells you to block out those people you should give them only two chances but one of my favorite quotes on this app is your scars are there for a reason they tell the story of how you have overcome so many things to become the amazing person you are . And I love that they have that “so I really recommend motivation when you’re feeling down helped me through my ups and downs. I think it could help you to.
5,Mw1127,"Love Love Love this app!! 💜 especially when dealing with depression and anxiety (sometimes both together 🤷🏻‍♀️😭) a motivational boost or simple positive change of thought is sometimes all we need. (I do! 🤷🏻‍♀️) 👸🏻☮️💟☯️♋️🛐 Me being a Cancer sign makes me even more aware of the good and bad juju and auroras around me.. and the things this app says is almost right on time, every time for that. (I set it on 30x a day lol) .. It changes my negative train of thoughts immediately, and you can like/dislike the quotes to make it better tailored for you.  ⭐️ We all need to do our best, that’s all we can do. Don’t forget to just live sometimes and enjoy the now. You really only do have yourself and people can be harsh these days. We just gotta be cool, till then. 😎  This app helps me. Two thumbs up for the great sayings / quotes and amount of times you can set it is from like 1-30 x a day or something. Customizable...   ☮️💟☯️♋️⭐️🛐"
5,ShelzNchz,"Potential users, you will not be disappointed! ...and I’d be shocked if you were.  This app has come in SUPER clutch so many times. Whether it’s a motivation quote I go to the app and seek out or if it’s a pop up notification on my home screen. ..which I’d swear my daily notification I get each morning is always just what I need & right on time.  This app has quotes and sayings for seemingly EVERYTHING... even if I want to throw up a little motivational “shade” on my social media without being totally rude.... I’ve found exactly what I’ve needed through a funny quote. LOL!!  I’m pretty sure I use this app daily and absolutely love it.  I refer friends to it all! the! time!  SN: I just read another review - I second the statement about being able to see the same quote when I open the app as I see on my notification without having to go through the notification.  I’ve had that same thought but is by no means a complaint, this app is amazing!!"
5,hdhsuxjsns,"I experienced what seemed to be a glitch when I first got the app. I downloaded the app and began setting it up when I came to a page that asked me if I authorize the free trial and the charge at the end of this trial. I wasn’t ready to commit to this yet, so I killed the app. Later I realized the trial had begun because I was getting the motivational notifications. I reached out to motivational about this and was shocked by the support provided. I understand that Apple manages the financial side of this app. However, their support team wasn’t even open to having a conversation with me. I clearly stated my situation thinking maybe this was a glitch can reverse it, and they responded with refund instructions. In the following emails they were condescending and gave every impression they didn’t want to talk to me. I understand if they can’t help me, however, provide a little empathy a legit explanation at the very least."
4,LiNSY,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Update: The glitches with the stuck quote and black screen seem to have been fixed. I haven’t had problems in a while… knock on wood!! The widget updates frequently with quotes I love seeing. I am rating it 4 stars for now because I’m not yet fully sold it’s been worth my money after so much frustration with MONTHS of glitches.   ⭐️ Previous 1 Star Review: “Do more of what makes you happy” shows up and STAYS STUCK on the widget ALL. THE. TIME. I’m so over it. Someone from the app needs to get in there and delete that quote from the collection so it stops showing up and sticking on my screen. It’ll stay on there for DAYS at time (despite my many attempts to clear it off) and then disappear for a nice cycle of great quotes… only to come back a week later and stay stuck for another few days… again. I have cancelled my subscription because of this glitch and will only renew if a couple months go by and I never see that cliche quote again.
5,Queen KQ,"I love this app already , I downloaded it after I seen some friends on Snapchat posting it . I downloaded it and was like OMG . This app is a app to help motivate you through the day . I love to wake up and see all these motivates and help me through the day . If I’m feeling down I look through the feed . I love this app ! It’s helped me through my day . You can even make widgets to look at everyday . Another thing I love about this app is that I can change how my feed looks ! Make it look beautiful to help me even more ! I total recommended this app if your ever feeling down ! It’s totally free with no money ! I can’t stop checking the feed every few hits . Honestly , I’ll just grow up with the app ! Because there is alot of stuff that I need to be motivated about . And this app is my number one . I love this app and I think YOU should get it . Also get the “ I Am “ app ! It motivates me you just like this app !"
5,Vyckklean,"Before I download this amazing app, I have been in a very deep hole, I was probably at my lowest during that time. But now I am at a way better state of mind, and one specific quote that really stuck to me was “Earn It, Don’t Expect It”. That has motivated me so much to chase that bag 💰 and to never give up on your dreams. With this app it has drastically changed my life, and I’m not saying that just to say it. I mean it. This app has not only motivated me, but it helped me view life in a whole different perspective !. I highly recommend you guys to download this, I promise you it’s going to help out a lot. There is a huge variety of quotes you can save and I have saved at least 50+ in the span of 1 month. Stay blessed you guys, and remember you are worth so much then you think, you are enough, so don’t change for other change for yourself.   - Victor"
5,dlythe,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I truly cannot stress enough how much this app has helped me become more positive and grateful  in life. The daily notification reminders help far more than you could ever expect them to. What you read truly is what you become. However, I want to address that I am very unhappy with the fact that I have paid for a yearly subscription and I can not send the folders I have created to my friends. I really don’t like the view of the collections either. I ask that you Please make it where there is an option to view your quotes that you’ve saved to view them in full screen again, just like how they were the first time i found them. I would love to be able to click on a collection I’ve made and be able to just scroll through the large word slides slide by slide. It would be a game changing features, especially for those with a subscription. Thank you!!"
5,Dre JA,"I really enjoy this app, it works pretty well at keeping me in a certain vibe throughout the day.  However, I think the Apple Watch integration could use some work. Is there a way to show the entire notification instead of just a snippet, especially for those longer quotes, I don’t wanna have to go to my phone every single time to see the full content as I’m almost always moving around. Another thing is the notifications I missed (because I can’t fully see them) I’m not able to swipe to see a list of past quotes. Maybe that’s a premium feature, I’m not sure, 🤷🏾‍♂️ but even on the phone from time to time there’s a quote displayed on the widget and when I tap it to open the app it cycles to a new one and I’m unable to swipe back to what I was shown on the Home Screen. Otherwise I love positivity of this app and it’ll hold a prominent place on my home screen."
5,the best bff,"Okay let’s start off by saying: this is by far the most motivating app I have ever got! I mean look at what it offers!! You get DAILY INSPIRATION! You get to set the number of times it gives you different quotes and the time range. You get to like others motivational and very inspirational quotes! You get to create your own!! Like how amazing is that!!?? All for free, there is however a premium free trial, but even without that the app is so cool!! I would 100% recommend!! It has given me so much perspective on life and has helped me see things in a completely other way! It had given me a lot of motivation to keep trying. If you need some change or inspiration in your life than download Motivational Quotes for free!! Tysm if you have read all of this, IK that this is very long, but that just goes to show how much I appreciate this app, and how amazing it is!!"
5,VickieC1015,"I am extremely satisfied with this app because I swear to all of you I will just be sitting in my car in a specific mood and then a quote pops up from this app and it is EXACTLY about what is happening in my life or has to do with EXACTLY how I am feeling and would need someone to say to me at the time. It’s freaky really, because once ehh whatever, 2 times oh ok coincidence but 3 times or more come on now? Are they in my head or can they see me through my phone? But anyways I have enjoyed this app and all the many motivational quotes it has given me, it has helped a bit knowing that someone wrote this quote so hey maybe somebody else actually knows how I feel. Also, I love that I can save them to my favorites and go back to look at the ones I want to look at whenever I want. Great job guys, keep up the good work! 👍🏻👍🏻🙏🙏❤️❤️"
5,FJB319,"8 months ago I started a journey in bettering myself. Discovering the powers of  mindfulness have lead me to have a strong desire for self betterment.  One of the greatest tools I have adopted into my daily life is using motivational quotes to keep myself focused on the importance of remaining positive and using positive affirmations.  This App has has become part of my recipe for success in recovery, the ability to have new quotes sent to me hourly or however frequently I desire keeps me from losing sight of what I need to do. The ability to customize the theme is also a nice bonus and allows me to use pictures I’ve taken in my favorite places in nature as a background which helps me maintain my positive energy and is a nice reminder why I am on this journey. Thank you for this game-changing App, I no longer have to spend hours searching Google for motivational quotes, the Motivation App delivers them to me every hour. 5*"
4,laundrysauce,"This app is amazing, and it helps and inspires me a lot. I scroll through it sometimes and find amazing quotes. There’s only one problem though, which is, like most games/apps, Premium. I think it limits a bit too much. For example, if I wanted to get over a breakup, I can’t do that. This app is supposed to make us feel better, right? So shouldn’t we have the right to at least choose an option that DOES make us feel better, without paying any money, which, may I add, sometimes makes people feel even WORSE about their day than they already are, because they’re spending MONEY to be HAPPY. I don’t think this is necessary if someone has a low self-esteem, but is only getting quotes about “life’s journey” and “go with the flow”. Sure, those things could help a little bit, but if a few more options were open to us, this app would be better. Like I said, amazing app, just this one problem. I hope the Dev’s take this advice. that’s all. bye~"
4,infinity gymnast girl,"I’m a 13 year old girl and I have been worried about my connection with god I wonder am I saved? Do I have a relationship with god? If I die am I going to heaven? I am always worried bc I feel like I don’t have any of that but I want to have a relationship with god but I just don’t know how! How do I start a relationship with god?? That’s what I want bc I believe in him but I have a feeling I’m not doing something right! I want to go to heaven and live with the messiah who died for me! I just feel as if I’m not saved! I feel like this app is helping! I’ve been purchasing a lot of apps containing ways to be close to Jesus but I just don’t feel any different! Like the title everyone needs Jesus, everyone! I want my prayers to be answered but if I don’t have a relationship with god and ask him to answer my prayers well it’s like asking a stranger to do a favor for me! I want a relationship with Jesus so I hope this app will guide me in the right direction."
3,kaiami*,"I do enjoy this app, but I think the subscription price is outrageous!! I’ve seen similar apps that allow you to customize a lot without a hefty price tag! Sixty bucks for a “lifetime subscription”, but it just doesn’t seem worth it to me. I can go on Word Swag and use their built in quotes, or Google quotes and put in there and make my image look any way I like!! If it allowed me to customize the pictures and quotes without the high price, I would give it 5 stars all day, but I don’t think it’s worth what they charge for the subscription service and I think it’s ridiculous to have to pay just to see the quotes you’ve “hearted”. A lot of room for improvement!! I understand the developers have to make money, but I have several of their apps (all similar to this), and I just don’t see how I could justify spending what they charge for the “services” or features you get! I hope you guys can come up with a better pricing plan or make the app more user friendly in some way!!"
2,< Queen Z >,"I really used to love this app. I love the option to write in my own quotes that can cycle along with other good quotes I’ve found through the app. This app just has been too buggy at this point, which is sad since it really is one of my favorite apps. Now whenever I add a quote, as soon as I add it to my favorites the author disappears. Very sad bc I can’t add any new quotes anymore without this issue happening. Also, they promise some really cool features, but they’re too buggy to really work, even several updates later. I’m still waiting for the option to only have my favorite quotes on my Apple Watch to actually work. Also, the newest update promised to have iOS 16 widgets, which are nowhere to be found. Perhaps these issues would be fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app, but since there’s no account creation option I think I would lose the few quotes I have left that I’ve saved. Would rate 5/5 stars bc I love this app, the bugs are just getting to be too much for me. 😭"
5,shondriekia,"These are the best inspirational, heart-warming, honest, and trust-worthiness, motivational quotes. I can just pick up my phone off the bed, and see it pop up on my iphone11(red..which I just love) it makes my day. To start my day with incredible, beautiful  words from incredible people; who went through pain, and suffering, lost of a family member, a new job, love, or even the birth of a sweet beautiful bundle of joy(a baby) is what I call.. KEEPING MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDER AND FAITH IN THE ALMIGHTY HIMSELF. OR BELIEVING IN SOMETHING SO BIG AND SO MUCH, IT WILL SCARE YOU TO PIECES (IN A GOOD WAY). I LOVE THIS APP AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. I even have friends askjng me for advice. I give them my LISTENING EAR, I’m an AWESOME LISTENER even better FRIEND for listening to the stories and situations I have heard. Even if they feel like it’s not what they feel they need to hear I give them a second option: Motivation App. I’m head over heals “Gung ho for the talent show”. KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK PEOLLE!!!"
5,Princess Kaala,"I’m 38 and as someone with severe depression and extreme anxiety , I want to thank my 15 year old son Richard for installing this app when I asked him to help me with setting up my new iPhone 13pro (I’m a first time Apple user). Somehow he knew it would help momma. He’s made me so proud, it’s the little things like this that brings tears to my eyes it’s tells me our children really are paying attention to us. Apparently he knew also exactly what categories to choose that would make an impact. This motivation app has helped me in my darker moments. Just reading the random uplifting reminders tailored specifically for me as I go about my days and the never more on point messages right when I need them, i must say this is an app that’s actually making a difference! Thank you to the creator. Truly motivationally EMPOWERING! I love you son thank you❤️"
5,Hailey Worley,I recommend this to everyone… though in my opinion they should lean back on the paying part a little bit other than that this app is amazing and I recommended to everyone it’s gotten me to think better thoughts and stuff and it’s just there if you want to scroll through and you wanna read some it’s great and you can like like it and you can go back if you want to and read it again if you’re having those thoughts and stuff of oh I need help on my self-love or something you can go back and read those ones that you favorite it and plus you can get notifications and you can read it anytime or you can just go onto the app and start scrolling and reading them it’s amazing I definitely do recommend this to everyone but that’s also my opinion but yeah it is beyond awesome.
5,babykj5,"I honestly didn’t think I would love this app as much as I do. I’m always taking screenshots of motivational quotes and saving them in my photos. I’m talking about hundreds!!! (most of which are on this app).  With this app I can actually save my favorites right on the app so I’ve been able to delete tons of things from my photo albums on my phone which is saving me so much space.  I also love that you can select different themes, styles, even genders of motivation that you’d like to see. You can set how many times a day you want to see them and background theme.  On some days it seems to send the exact thing that I needed to read at that time. I often share them with my family and friends. Especially my teen children and their friends!  Definitely an A+ app!!!"
4,K owl,"I gave this app four stars because of a few things. First of all, you can only choose like, three different fonts and the rest of them you have to buy, second of all, adds pop up every time you swipe through only about 7 quotes. Then you have to watch an ad for at least 6 seconds. Also, the same quote, (don’t stare up the stairs to success, step up the stairs!) keeps popping up every once in a while. Another thing is that you can only pick from two of the themes, (normal and love) and you have to buy the rest of them.  On the other hand it is a good quality app with good graphics and a variety of quotes. I would suggest buying this app if you need a small pick me up once in a while. I like this app because it is a good dose of happiness medicine for you. I hope you pick this app, because it is free, and it is a nice good app for motivating. I like this app a lot."
3,some1whohasnolifeee,"So i love this app very much. its very helpful sometimes. Especially thru very dark times. But, when i need sormthing very specific , like sad  or death or letting go quotes, they r locked. i get that the app needs money, but there should be way less locked options. all of the important ones r locked. Honestly it makes me so upset, bc none of he general quotes help enough. i love the system and the idea of it, but it just doesnt make sense why u would help us and then limit the anount u would . I cant pay for that pro version. i wishi could but i cant. My point is, please make atleast the very very very important options usable . and there should eb some more quotes abt luke suicidal thoughts for ppl who r suicidal. these r suggestions, and i understand why u need to have things locked . but pls pls pls unlock the super important ones in which ppl would need that kind of support right away. everypne needs support. not just the ppl who can PAY for it ."
1,AndresV.,"I’ve had this app for two years and have the subscription. It never had iCloud backup and my multiple devices had different saved quotes and I didn’t like that. To update my iPhone, apparently the app got uninstalled and now that I realized it was missing and re-downloaded it again, I find a way to login to Apple. I read every single app update notes and I must have missed the login mention. It sure would have been helpful to see that in the notes or mentioned when opening the app when that feature was included because now that I’m back, I’m missing hundreds of quotes. I don’t blame the dev for the app temporarily being uninstalled. That’s on Apple and my small storage on my phone. I do wish the dev had made it known (better) so that nothing would had been lost. At this point, I am considering cancelling my subscription because everything was lost and it’s costing me $15/year for something basic that should have been included years ago. I might as well look for something better now."
5,Pisces in march,"I love the app and how you can set it up .. but after I post on Facebook the screen goes black and I can’t get out of it. I thought this update would clear it up, but it has not. If you could fix this the app would be perfect! I love the daily quieted and how you can pick the ones that apply to you personally. So please fix that glitch! Thank you!!! … UPDATE: The developer got back to me about this issue, and was correct about being a Facebook issue. With their app updated, the issue has been resolved! I LOVE this app, you get a variety of quotes you can post and like. Five stars all the way! Also, Thank you to the developer for actually reading my review and taking the time to investigate the issue. It’s nice to be heard and know your opinion actually matters!! A FANTASTIC APP ALL AROUND!"
1,Ima Georgia Peach,"I just received a response from the developer of Motivation about my review where I said ""I thought I had finally found an app that wasn’t all about money."" Because now they have pretty much have locked everything down unless you buy a subscription. They basically told me that due to the times they have to keep their free version the way it is now in order to keep their app maintained, updated and fresh. They then proceeded to tell me that they have a free trial if I were to subscribe to their app. My response to them is: Why would I want to do a very short free trial when all I’m saying is to have a little more variety to choose from with a free version instead of getting bullied into a subscription! I’m educated to know that it doesn’t take locking all of the content of the app unless you pay for one of subscription plans so the developers can keep the app updated, fresh, and everything else. This is my personal opinion about the ridiculous changes that’s been made by the developers."
5,best day ever972472,This app is probably the best app I’ve seen ever but the thing I would want to change about it would be I don’t know really about having to pay $20 monthly or yearly I forgot what it was but I just feel like it just should have a little bit of change so it’s like has for people that can’t or need to save money like me to like redo a room like I’m doing but I feel like it should be not that much money or no money at all that would be really nice otherwise I would give this a 10 out of 10 but disclaimer for the publisher could you please make it so that you don’t have to pay and I will get all of my friends already have a lot of my friends trying to download this so if you could please do so that would make my year thank you
5,JD the barber,"My name is Jaray and I am an alcoholic.  I was recently coming off a binge when I found this app.  After about 4 days of non stop liquor consumption and no food I was at an all time low.  I had picked up my phone trying to call everyone I knew while I was drunk saying wild stuff-(a lot of which I regret).  Once my body couldn’t take anymore I was dormant in my bed searching for people to send me some kind of motivation.  I was apologizing to certain people, living with so much regret and memory loss.  I then decided to turn to my phone for some pep for each day just to keep me going.  As I regained my strength I realized the encouragement I needed to provide me myself.  This lead me to this app.  I am grateful that there is still some good on my phone and in me.  To whoever read this keep everybody in prayer including me.  Thank you!!! Jay D"
5,gheeeeelawkkssssa,"It’s honestly crazy how much this app can really help you. When I first got this app, I was just honestly filled with mental health problems. I was super stressed, super upset with myself, super tired of just being around because when I tell you these negative thoughts took over me, they did. When I got this app, I was reading through them when I first got it and I honestly felt like someone understood me! In school I would literally get upset and go to the bathroom and break down and whenever I did have my phone on me, I read through them and just breathed to calm myself down. And I swear like when they put out quotes for notifications, it’s right on time which is freaky but helpful. THANK YOU TO WHOEVER MADE THIS APP. - from someone’s who deeply needed it."
5,S1🖖🏼,"I love this app! Seems like at the right moment I’m blessed with something inspirational or encouraging to get me through the challenges of my day or make a great day even better! Thank you for lifting me up and making me smile!!! 😃☺️💖💓💖  My only issue is when I upgraded my cell my app didn’t come with me. I had a wonderful collection of motivational quotes I collected and now I’m left with starting over. My new motivational app doesn’t seem to send me quotes like it used to. Matter a fact, the first quote on my new cell told me….. “you’re going to always be alone!”   What kind of motivation is that….. ⁉️that’s cruel to say to anyone…. Especially, someone who struggles with depression and anxiety!!😥 …. Well, you obviously motivated me to leave a comment! I miss my original motivation………… GOOD VIBES ONLY!"
5,TRoSpears,I was interested in using the app for the free trial period. I was charged $54 for this app and for what I haven’t any idea. I requested a refund though Apple and was told that I was ineligible due to my overall account history? Now that the $54 has been charged and there isn’t anything that I can do about it and Apple has told me that I have been rejected for a refund twice and it is now out of there hands. The app after the $54 charge is still stating that I need to upgrade to the Pro version so that I am able to access any of the app’s features and Apple Support directed me here to the app store to get the technical difficulties tended to. I thought the app was intended to help relieve stress and it ended up creating a chain of events that I am so upset I forgot to cancel the free trail!!
5,wcm44,"I downloaded this app approximately almost 2 years ago and didn't purchase it for quite a while. When the new iOS came out with Widgets is when I bought it. It's like someone is speaking life into me 4x a day I have it set for. After buying you can also pick which categories you want it to pull from and once setup right for you, it will motivate you every day for whatever reason you need it. I don't write reviews but I am for this Developer to say THANK YOU‼️   I have sent this to so many people via text and Instagram/Facebook stories that people asked me where they come from. So far 2 others in my life have gotten it. I am a Professor at a University and have a lot of people who need inspiration besides myself!"
5,AuntLeLe317537,"I’ve been using this app for several years, and I absolutely love it. I have a widget on my home screen, on my Do not Disturb Home Screen, a smalller one on the list of widgets when you swipe from the left side of the screen while on your Home Screen. I get as many as the app will allow me to have each day I save a bunch of them to my photos and I text them often when I run across one that fits a certain person. I absolutely love this app. Oh, and I have the other ones to the vocabulary words, I Am positive affirmations, Jokes, abdy new favorite- Moodlight - daily tracker on my mood, current situation, triggers, feelings, etc. it’s been interesting learning my trends, patterns and what tinfluences my mood and what doesn’t."
5,Abhi Trades,"Hey guys! I honestly want to say Thank You to the creators of this app, and the whole development team that makes it possible. I have just came to realize this is the best app I have ever downloaded and it secretly helped change my life and I just came to that realization. Life is hard and I never hear these things from my family, friends, television etc. They really pick you up and are so heart felt at times it makes me so thankful they created the app! I set like 20 reminders a day I don’t mind, I love the creativity of the app it’s so cool and meaningful. I love the positivity and just keep updating the app, adding new categories, etc. Guys chase your dreams no matter what it is, and apps like this just help out. Have a blessed day y’all. Keep being awesome 🤟🏼"
1,123483829929962637,"I’ve had this app for a while but I’m deleting it because I don’t find it useful anymore.   First, they made everything basically an in-app purchase. I don’t care enough to customize the background to spend money. The free options they give you are hideous so because I can’t customize the background for free, that is one reason I am deleting.   Second, I only use this app as a widget so I can see quotes on my Home Screen. Recently they must have made an update where they want you to “open the widget to keep to contents fresh”. They request this too often. I already have a task list of about 100+ things a day. Opening up the app to be able to see the quote is not something I want to do. I just want the quote to be displayed on the Home Screen at all times - no interaction required. Since they have made keeping this app inconvenient, this is the second reason I am deleting it.   Finally, the quotes are redundant. I see the same boring and uninspiring quote over and over. Sometimes I see the same quote 3 times in one day. This is the third reason I am deleting the app.   It’s overall just  annoying to have no and serves no purpose for me anymore. If the developers change all of the issues mentioned above, reach out and I’ll redownload the app. Until then, it’s getting deleted. It’s unfortunate too because I have had this app for over 2 years."
5,♡Sunshine Kenzie♡,"I love it, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I hated myself, I hated my life, until I found the quotes in this life changing app! If it wasn’t for me to find it, then it wasn’t for me to live! Totally recommend downloading it if your going through hard times, and even if you’re not then u should still download it, it will help u a lot! People can be mind filled with these amazing, inspiring poems, and it’s amazing thing that they share them! Live to love, love to live! Life is harder without Encouragement, and so that’s why we have each other :)! The app is incredible, I came across a poem and it made me realize what I was doing to myself, and now I won’t do it again!!! “Ships don’t sink because of the water around them, they sink from the water inside them, so don’t let anything get into i and weigh u down! I LOVE it!"
5,pattyba731,"I started receiving motivational quotes the end of Sept 2020.  I read them whenever I got the chance.  I could relate a lot of the quotes to areas of my life...  Gave me hope. On Oct 3, 2020 my 12 yr old dog, Marley died.  I got Marley a couple years after my 19 yr-old son tragically died,  she helped me to start accepting his death and helped me to start my new life without him physically being there with me.  I lost my husband a little more than 5 yrs after my son died. I have to say losing them nearly destroyed me...  I kept going because my daughter and Marley needed me...  It's been 3 days since I lost Marley and I’m not taking Marleys death that well either.  Then I received this motivational quote...                         ""[...] when u know,                         you know.                And you don't fight it.        You don't deny the inevitable.           You freefall because you                    know there's someone there     to catch you on the other side...""                            -S.L.                         Jennings  ...made me once again realize that whenever in the very distant future,  it is ""my time to go"" I know the 3 of them will be there to meet me...   It's uncanny how relatable and motivational these quotes really are... Patty B."
5,lilpeepyh,"i’ve been missing this guy and it’s been really hard lately, i’ve been getting notifications from this app and it makes me really happy and feel safe. it makes me realize what’s true and what’s not, i’ve been getting lpve quotes like “Real love is when you want what’s best for the other person, even if it means you not getting what you want” and “Good relationships don’t just happen. They take time, patience and two people getting through all the hard times together.” and it’s really been making me happy and realizing the guy was no good for me, i’ve been having a better time now that this app makes me self aware by sending me daily messages everyday. 40 notifications minimum and it’s amazing. i recommend this app"
5,pattiqt143,"Hi I’m a depressed woman who lost her husband are suicide and I’ve been alone with the kids and his parents sold our house and kept the money and made us leave.  I love him, and I miss him every day he was Very Abusive to me and himself It’s been horrible for years and this app sends me Wonderful reminders That life is great good things are happening and My Father God loves me so much , so I recommend this app for your daily reminders to love yourself to think positive and keep moving forward I recommend to anybody and everybody , I want to thank all the people that made this app and who keep the app up and running the developers. You guys are amazing. Thank you so much. five stars just isn’t enough for helping me.  Thank you thank you thank you."
5,A_L_L_I.com,"I’m not the kind of person to leave reviews like this, but I can’t help but think that this app is the best one out there. It has a sense of connection you feel.  You can pick your topic on what you want a quote on and it will give you one without hesitation or you can enable notifications and it will send a quote every hour. This game is used for meditation, anxiety, stress, and deep breathing. You can get this app for free and NO ADS. If you want a good app and need meditation or anti-stress this is the app for you. There is a reason that they call this app motivation, they hope that they will give you a quote and you will write it on paper or on your mirror so that you can  memorize it and make it fit into your life. This app fits all genders too."
5,lemmooon,"I downloaded this because I was excited to fill my Home Screen with widgets, but little did I know the limitless possibilities of this app. I can customize widgets, I can time their change, I can schedule motivational/positive messages and how many I’d like to get in a day, I can save quotes and upload my own quotes, and I can ask SIRI to give me quotes based on my own selections. This app is already filling empty spaces and reassuring me, I bought the yearly subscription after only a day because it’s a small price to pay for the overwhelming effects it’s already had on me. This app makes me feel like I’m never actually alone, props to the creators for figuring it all out so we didn’t have to!!!! I’m using this for life <<3"
5,JiMickey,I think this is a feature I might not know how to do but it might already exist in the app.  Sometimes a motivation badge will pop down as a notification (I love those!).. but I’m not finished reading it sometimes then it slides away.  So I run to the app to finish “reading it” and it’s no where to be found :(. Leaves me hanging quite unsatisfied .   I wish there was a way I could go straight to the latest “banner notification” in the app.  Other than that- this is a LOVELY app for motivation!!!  I feel like I need and feed off of the words and messages that it sends me daily.  They seem to be words I need to hear usually at the perfect time :) :). It’s like this positive or reassuring or “let’s get real” daily ‘buddy’.  I love it!!!!!😻😻😍😍🤩🤩👏👏👍👍
5,Us3rTAKEN,"When I first got the app I was worried it would repeat itself or cost me, but infact it’s free and you can put the quotes as a widget on your Lock Screen or Home Screen. And get this YOU can choose the topics to help motivate you through your day(like work, religion, ANYTHING) You can adjust how many quotes you get per day, when you get them, and how to design them! So it’s not too girly or boyish. And probably the best of all it’s super easy to understand. So far I haven’t had a repeated quote, none of them were complicated or hard to understand( idk but sometimes quotes just don’t make sense) and this is gonna sound crazy but I feel that each quote was relevant to my day and made me think a lot in a positive way. 10/10"
5,Ekaksd,"This app is legit one of my favorite most valued apps on my phone. It has gotten me through some happy, sad, good, and bad days. Then there’s the fact of coming across something so mind blowing and profound it makes you ponder pretty much on a daily basis. Then there’s Being able to create your own quote and then you can personalize everything just the way you like it! Which is also awesome. I gladly, do,and will continue paying for this app yearly. I mean why not have year round positivity to help you out of those days that you just don’t wanna or think you can. Don’t forget you can always share with friends and family. 1 of these quotes could literally turn someone’s whole day around. That to me is worth every penny."
5,sjma04,"First & foremost, I want to say thank you Instagram that I came across to such an amazing app. Literally was for me. Secondly, Thank you to the creator(s) who invented this app. I really love it. The notifications always come at the right time. Like, whenever I feel down or when “that” time comes, it makes that notification sound & I would check it up immediately to what this app would give me. The right quotes mostly comes to really relating to what I would feel at the moment. I would think like “what a coincidence” or “Is this a sign?“ and “how can it come into such timing”. I’d guess it’s a sign and a coincidence. They really uplift me. It helps me keep realizing everyday & motivate me. ❤️ So thank you. I so recommend this app. ♾/10  - Feb 23, 2022"
5,vane.s09,"It’s crazy to think that a app can change who you are every time I look into this app I just brings me happiness and all the sudden I feel more loved this app is amazing there is so much people that care about you “ Look back and be grateful, Look ahead and be hopeful,Look around and be helpful” this one is my favorite it made me think back in the great times I had in my life I started crying cause I can’t believe that I came this far to just sit here. Right now I’m very stressed on school homework and it goes to at some point I just want start crying and think that I’m going to start a year before I don’t want be embarrassed cause no one in my family has done that I this app make so happy and it makes me think about the great times I definitely recommend this app🥺❤️❤️❤️"
5,lexibush,"I haven’t had this app for long, but I have already fallen in love with it. You can customize what type of motivation you want and when to get notifications for it. When you are in the app itself you can scroll through your feed. When you find one you like you can share it, save it, copy it, and heart it (which means you want to see more like it). When you heart it, you are basically saying you want to see similar things on your feed. Even though there is a premium option, some things like the theme can be used by watching a single add. I definitely would recommend this app to a friend. Also, for all of the doubters, this is a review I am writing on my own. No influence from the app, and no payment before hand."
5,fake_cannibal_venom,"Hi! I downloaded this app because I heard you could get daily reminders with really nice quotes. When I purchased the app, I got just that! In fact, I could change how many reminders I wanted. For the longest time I wanted someone who could tell me I would be okay or someone to reassure me, and this app was perfect for it! 👏☺️☺️☺️ I love waking up and seeing something nice to start my day. The quotes don’t even sound like they were taken from some cliche Facebook post on Google. They’re genuine and real and more caring than anyone in my life. I love this app and can’t recommend it more.   The only downside is that you get general sweet quotes and you have to pay for specific ones (exercise, marriage) but that’s totally understandable. The general quotes are satisfying enough 👍✨"
5,hejajakaiakkakaiis,This app is very motivational it gives you self confidence it bring the best out in people you could read a quote and it change your mood the rest of the day it gives you something to k think about when you read a quote sometimes I haven’t came across no foul language and that’s good for a lot of the younger kinds of people that are very Christian or anyone really you can just read a quote with out saying oh well why is that in there these quotes are one of the best things ever because sometimes they inspire some of my friends to get out of bed in the morning but anyway you should just download this app because it’s is very inspiring and motivating and honest and some of the quotes really make you think for a while
5,JihmGiant,I’m writing this review in response to a review I recently read about the lack of features for the free version. I would disagree that this app offers nothing for free. I personally really enjoy all of the features that I’ve gotten from the app.   As an aspiring minimalist the new black and white theme is perfect. After picking what categories of quotes I want and setting up notification schedules I find that the app serves my needs well. I usually begin and end my day with a quote notification and save the ones I really enjoy. After setting up the app I see no reason to continuously go back and fiddle with it except for changing the notification times.   As for the premium features they’re nice but not what I want to spend money on right now but for free I am more than satisfied with the app.   I think individuals needs a realistic expectation of what to expect for “free” in an app and understand that apps take a lot of work to develop. We have $1000 cell phones in our pockets but fuss at the thought of spending a minuscule fraction of that cost on apps that genuinely increase the functionality and the fun of these portable computers we now all carry.
4,blessed5234,"It’s amazing! I can’t find anything better! But almost everything good is locked. I mean I get it, people have to make money, but shouldn’t this be about helping people, not money? I mean I have times when I need to hear motivation about stress or other problems and I can’t. If you ask me they need to unlock at least a little more than what they have. And they should have an option where they mix categories of your choice. But it’s not all bad. It really is motivating and really helps me everyday. It’s really inspirational and life just seems so much easier with motivation waiting for me everyday! Thank you creators! Your app is amazing and unlike any other! Please keep working hard to improve and make it better. Thanks for reading! Ps. I will be doing a monthly review so be expecting me next month!"
5,KS ILLT...,"I’ve been using this app for a few years now and I am really enjoying it depending on the season of life that I’m in I switch up the topics.  So I think of this is sort of a compass for me when days get busy or I get lost and I looked at my notifications and I see a reminder aligned with what I need for that time frame.  I like using a combination of humor and changing up the various motivational thoughts.    I recently was diagnosed with ADHD in an adult woman and I’m now starting to realize the impact of inattentiveness.  To the developer:  It would be a nice addition to include tips, quotes or humor for living with ADHD just like you did with anxiety. Really nice job on the app. I’ve recommended it to many people!"
5,userhyssqbjjgfs136344,"I really like this app and recommend it to anyone who constantly needs reminders because bad things happen all the time and it’s nice to read quotes from people who have been through tough times as well, I love how you can add it to your home screen and change the background, not just that but iv learned so much about mentality, self care, and overall became more independent, calm cool and collected, and wiser after I started useing this app. I can’t imagine my Home Screen without it, it’s always telling me things I don’t want to but NEED to hear to become the best version of myself. I really recommend this to everyone, even if your not depressed or anxious it’s still a healthy app to have."
5,Sad_Boi_Hours_,"For quite some time now, I’ve realized that I’m so burnt out that I have no drive or motivation to do anything. I need to have something to tell me that I need to get something done and this does just that. And at such a decent price too. To me, it’s kind of important because I’ve grown up a very active person, and now I don’t even want to step out of my house. I’m afraid of how people look and me and what they’ll say to me and so on and so forth. It’s nice to know that people have once felt the same and wrote these quotes to let people like me know that it’s okay and you can get through it. It’s just another day, but I want to make it a better day. This will help me achieve that and get some work done."
4,Deciphering the Signal,"Thank you and your team for your support and motivation towards hope for a better tomorrow. I would love to pay it forward and I waited so long to reach out to others like your team of caring people and wisdom. I hope to have the words sink in enough finally after all these past hard years to actions that will improve life for others and myself struggling to get through these difficult times. I haven’t met anyone in person for a long time that I feel such kindness and compassion as I do from others online, and I hope to meet kinder people that genuinely care and respect each other more than ever…this is my prayer for peace and more more love in the future. Please keep up the great work you do. I’m very thankful for your app. 💜🙏🏼🙂"
2,Asporkable,"I really loved this app, but to force people into paying they got rid of soooooo many features, and i'm extremely disappointed because i would recommend this app a lot and unfortunately i will no longer do this. this app was great but you can no longer change the background or have multiple topics selected at once so the app constantly gives you the same quotes if you continue scrolling. this app is only 10% that it was before for free users. i was okay with scrolling and getting ads, but i'm not okay not even having my own selected background and only being able to subscribe to one topic. unfortunate that these developers are so hungry for money that they want me to pay $10 a month for this app. i do not recommend this app unless you are willing to pay $10 a month."
2,Cydney hates this game,"I like this app very much, and it does keep me going and feeling better about myself. However having to pay for everything you basically want, is outrageous. Everything is locked and the only way to unlock it is to pay for it. I think it would be an amazing idea if there was goals you had to reach, and each time you would reach it you would unlock something. Like something to give you motivation and to reward you for it. This app could use some work making it better and not so annoying to use, every time there’s a subject I want to use to help me get better in the way I need to. I can’t use it and I’m stuck with the general, sometimes giving me quotes I don’t even need. But over all props to the idea but it needs more work, to help make the consumers happier.   It would be great if you looked into these ideas. Thank you -one of your users"
5,lanieloulou,"Honestly this app used to be so helpful. But now every time I see it, all I feel is frustration towards this app. I hate the way Motivation became so focused on money. You literally can unlock a background FOR ONE MINUTE by watching an ad. How upsetting is that? I can’t stand the fact that every time I see a notification all I think about is how they’re making money off of my mental illness and the hard work I am trying to make to recover from depression and anxiety. I hope I am not the only one who feels this way, and I look forward to seeing some changes made for the app. If there are zero changes made, then I can’t see myself using the app for much longer."
5,BaerITaLL,"Just when I think my day is mundane, I get a reminder of a way to take a moment ... Reset my attitude, Forge forward towards thinking differently, thereby experiencing the ebb and flow of life with a broadened sense of self. And mindful observations of each day through the help of this this “Motivational App”. Some of the reminders are so spot on according to my current circumstances.     If I didn’t know any better I’d say… That someone had been ☎️speaking to my mother.            And she conspired with the Developer😄🥸😌... Snuck in some of her ☝🏼""motherly spun wisdom” that she dispenses, Oh so cleverly...and of course just at the appropriate time.                       Nonetheless please continue to improve this app with new ideas... It’s already a huge help to me. And I can only assume, also to other people as well.     And I for one just can’t wait to see how far you take things... possibly creating new features, adding new pearls of soundness.        Simply put...I am happy to have found this app.      And I must say, Thank You for the creation of which I call…  “My pocket pal peace of mind”📱"
3,5SecsOfSheeran_1D,"I got this app wanting just daily reminders or motivations to be on my home screen. it is FREE, i don’t think people realize you can skip the payment section by clicking the C on the top corner. However, it’s kind of hard to get quotes that actually interest me or cater to the things I am interested — which is weird because when you first open the app it ask you for you to choose a few topics that you like.I wanted study reminders things for affirmations things for anxiety or depression etc. every time i click a category , i have to watch an ad. once the ad is finished, a check mark appears but i still don’t receive any quotes about that category? it’s all cheesy love quotes/moving on stuff that i don’t need 😂 my partner is going to think i’m leaving them if they see these notifications on my screen."
2,Kelly Rho,"I purchased this subscription because I felt like I really needed the daily inspiration in my life. I loved the idea of quotes, in the form of notifications, popping up on my screen several times a day to help keep me grounded. Instead, I’ve found the notifications to be inconsistent, at best. Some days I receive none at all. I was told there is a limit to how many a person can receive in a day, and that I would need to go in and open the app at least once a week to continue to receive them. I have been opening the app almost daily to try to avoid a lapse in notifications, but that hasn’t helped much at all. I’ve received none today, even though I opened the app yesterday.  I rarely purchase subscriptions and thought this would be worthwhile. To say I am frustrated and disappointed would be an understatement."
3,Sgrames13,"I want to like this app a lot - sometimes I really do but sometimes I also really don’t. Occasionally I get good quotes that make me feel inspired and empowered. Other times I get very generic quotes or even quotes that make me feel bad about myself or the loved ones in my life. I feel it’s very hit or miss even with the personalization I managed to do during setup. That being said… I really can’t personalize the app anymore because I have the free version. I constantly get in-app pushes to upgrade to the paid version which is getting very annoying. I downloaded this app to help with my mental health and I just feel like it’s causing more stress sometimes. I’m going to give it a little more of a chance, but I’m not sure even the free version is really worth it."
5,waterproofmelon,I was taught that in this world not everyone is nice and kind. But sometimes you will meet nice person and willing to help.. there is more people out there for themselves… but sometimes you will find someone willing to go out of their way to help you and really touch your heart.. this app is “someone is willing to help you and someone is willing to help you and get stronger.”  I am only using basic now.. but even basic is a lot better than other apps.. other apps require you to pay after 5 or 7 days but this app let you use basic for free.. Thank you “Someone “ I hope many people use your app and to learn to love yourself….
1,thabroffessor,"If you love historical quotes and bits of wisdom, this is not the app for that. The quotes on this app are vapid, pop culture and tween focused bits of nothing. In addition the app is very inconsistent, you are allowed to set scheduled quotes, but that doesn’t seem to work or last long. Finally the creators of this app clearly feel the need to press there own political and social messages, rather than presenting a well rounded sample of world views in there quote selection. After more than a week of not receiving a single quote (despite being scheduled for daily quotes) I was sent one by now Elliot Paige, only a day or so after declaring that she is now a man. There is nothing wrong with the quote or Paige, rather this is cheap virtue signaling. In other words, this app feeds quotes that say you need to be Woke AF and will clearly prioritize people they see in that light like Elliot Paige. So, my advice, spend you mental energy wisely, and on a better app than this."
4,Mindfuku,"I have come to appreciate daily dose of motivation and the impact it can have on your well-being. Motivation is an excellent app and I highly recommend it to everyone. The app has a really nice selection of motivational categories along with Home and Lock Screen widgets, which are a really nice touch. My only issue with the app is the lack of a dislike button. While you are able to heart/like a quite when it hits the mark there’s no way to provide critical feedback. Often time I see a quote that does not resonate with me and I’d like to tell the app “less these this one, please”, but there’s no way to do it. Please add this feature  and I’ll be happy to update my rating.   Thank you."
4,Jangiee,"I really like this app because it gives you advice& motivation that you can use in your life & it helps you a lot especially if your going through something however I feel like the app should give us more, Meaning that a lot of the topics in the app are locked because you have to pay & you also have to pay for how you want your quotes to look & I mean we should be motivated in the way we like & yes that has to do with the appearance of the quotes . In addition to what I said about the topics , I think that we should get more because there’s some quotes we can’t relate too & the ones we might relate too are again locked because you have to pay . All in all this is a great app but I think it can be better for everyone 😌."
5,The Texas Agent,Several months ago is had a conversation with MonkeyTap. They are great people. They truly care about the apps that are developed and how they can help in people’s mindfulness and mental health. Each of their apps is designed with a purpose to enable people to expand their cognitive abilities and development. I use Motivation and Vocabulary everyday. They are customizable and have a large amount of good information. I post directly on social media and save images to share with friends from the app with works seamlessly.   Thank you P & P! (I didn’t want to put your names up without your permission). Y’all are doing great and helping many people!
5,Captain Vat,"I installed it just for a widget on my Home Screen. I found out you can customize the image background, and have it refresh every so often. With the notifications, daily i am reminded of what keeps me going. After the free trial was up, i figured I’d be forced to pay to keep it on my phone, or uninstall it. And here we are a week later, and i still have “full”access to what you get when installed.   I am thoroughly impressed, with the app itself and the developers. The monthly subscription for full access isn’t but a few bucks, and for some of the categories that you unlock, seems totally worth it in my option. Good job on a phenomenal app!"
3,Nikroh,"It has so much potential but it’s glitchy. It gets stuck, ends up with question marks within the words, the same background , the quote selections are limited and when you message a quote to someone - it ends up annoyingly duplicating the statement under the main message and it has to be deleted before sending it or your message looks ridiculous. Everything was working well in the 3 day trial , enough to hook me in. I ended paying for the whole year which was the only option , thinking that this will be a good motivational app. It was after purchase that things started to act glitchy and all the issues started. I hope the developers will take the time and address all these fixable issues."
4,hmm that's pretty neat,"I love a lot of the quotes i get about my chosen topics! they truly are motivational, but as a user since 2021 i have a few issues with the app…  1. I KEEP getting religious quotes even though i have that category TURNED OFF!! i don’t want quotes from the bible, nor have i ever wanted them in the first place. please fix this, because i’m getting tired of having to thumbs them down each time.  2. i have found that creating a custom theme is WAY harder than it should be. Having to line up my background in your theme creator to make a “clear” look takes me hours. if there is a way to make it so that you can see exactly where the widget will line up, i think it would make it 100x easier!!  3. there should be an option to make MULTIPLE CUSTOM THEMES!! i tried doing this and it completely erased my other one, so i’m going to assume that it isn’t a function yet. i highly recommend adding this, as i switch between themes on my home screen pretty often.  id say if you fix these three things, this app will get 5 stars from me, but for now, it’s 4"
5,Kyra Damir,This app on your phone or smart watch allows you to surround yourself with powerful words and energy. Keeping you aligned with whatever purpose you set for yourself. It’s so customizable that you can access any energy you need to read. So many times this app has notified me of words that helped me through the moment. It’s one of the few apps I allow notifications on and will always pay any amount for. Our environment is so important to staying in the frequency that we desire. This gem of a app is essential in creating a beautiful environment. Thank you for existing and assisting. 💙💙💙💙💙
4,cerica16,"One of my favorite aspects of this app is that I can set daily reminders & automatically get quotes sent to my phone throughout the day at random times. Another one of my favorite aspects was that if I didn’t open the quote in the app as soon as it appeared on my lock screen (or at the top of my screen if my phone was unlocked), it would still be in my drop down menu so I could click & view it later. This aspect is gone-and I HATE that! I see some great quotes that I’d love to save to my phone, but I can’t always do it right that second so the fact that the quotes that appear on my phone throughout the day are now no longer available anywhere is really annoying. Please fix this issue!"
5,feedback2015,"I have been using multiple positive type quotes after a major injury. I found that just five minutes a day of quotes, sayings, and sometimes just something to think about other than what’s going on at that moment. I highly recommend this app. My favorite feature is the fact you can just share a motivational or a positive quote to someone’s text messages, Facebook page Instagram, or just an email. You will be amazed at how it affects you and your state of mind as well as the people you share them with Besides one thing this world needs now more than ever Is patience, positivity and compassion"
2,mattanderson,"This is a fabulous app, with great intention and quotes. I loved getting to see the motivations every day.   The down sides are two: it used to be mostly free and have some quotes come up and then you could click on them to view them in full when only half of the quote was on the notification. Now, nearly every single time I click on a notification, it just shows an upgrade to premium. So you can’t even read the whole quote. It is very frustrating. At least have us watch a five second ad or something in order to see the quote that made us curious!  As far as pricing goes, come into line with most other quote apps and you should find that more people pay for the upgrade. Try $0.99 per month or $9.99 for the whole year!  Then watch how many people pay it. You’ll probably make more money."
5,MonalyssaBrooke,"Generates fantastic inspirational quotes with the author’s name below.  I’ve had this app for months now and it just keeps getting better and better. You can chose between dozens of beautiful backgrounds and unique fonts, for when you check out what your new quote will be for that day.  It also provides plenty of different settings to pick from like; how many daily quote notifications you want to receive, how you want to receive them, etc. You won’t be disappointed!  Definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves learning new quotes and/or needs some daily inspiration. And it’s free, so it’s a win win :)"
5,Holinnd Sesler Page,this app has helped me so much lately without the one amazing creative happy and so much more that words can’t even explain person that’s always been there for me and was always n my side witch is my mom she died when my was eight years old and i am now 10 is it hard without her yes do i struggle a lot without always being there for me also yes but should I give up SHOULD WE GIVE UP NO!Never give up because you are an creative amazing immaculate and beautiful person that even words can’t explain and i love here always will and same for everybody else that is hurting                        ~ Holinnd Sesler Page
4,ThisNickname=Taken,"I’ve had this app for going on three years. For many many months, maybe even a year, the reminders are not working. I have several categories established to send quotes 30 times a day (the maximum) as an ongoing experiment but none of the reminders occur. As a result I forget about the app and don’t open it up for days/weeks. Therefore, because the reminders aren’t working I’m paying for an app I’m not using. When the reminders were working I liked the app. Also, I find half the quotes not that great, but for the price I was okay with that. However, again if notifications are not working I won’t use the app. I will not renew next year."
5,Stevenh62949,"I’ve been so impressed having this app. I was looking for something that would more frequently remind me to have gratitude and positive emotions. This is such a simple app, but serves such a significant purpose. All the quotes are so spot on. I frequently favorite and save the quotes; they are also constantly adding new ones, which is what makes this so impressive. It helps me get back on track faster because it’s a constant reminder. Absolutely worth the paid cost. I am very thankful to have found the app because I do think it’s increased the quality of my life! Sounds corny but it is absolutely true 🙌🏼"
5,JoyyCououte,"I would just like to say that for anybody wanting to become their better self or their best person you should definitely download this app I downloaded this app when the iOS 14 first came out and once it did I was not disappointed,From time to time I would look down and glance whenever I got the notification of the Motivation app and to my surprise it was the exact word I needed at that moment. no I’m not saying it’s better than the Bible because nothing will ever be better than the Bible,However I do enjoy the versatility to pick what type of topic you would like to be motivated on. such a great app 10 out of 10 hands-down needed in your phone!"
5,B Lakes,"Hey, just a regular 16 year old here. Just wanted to say how great this app is. I want to inform you I’m not a bot and this is a real person. Take it however you want but this app is life changing. Get the premium as it is a must. So many quotes available and never the same. Gets me going everyday. Take a few minutes out of your day to look over some and you will be inspired for sure. I love this app dearly as it helped me get back on  track. As a 16 year old who wants to go pro in mlb, it makes me work harder. Obviously this app will not work for you but it can help you get started. Great app for athletes or anyone looking for a boost."
2,PotterPanFangirl,"This app used to be amazing. I loved getting inspiring quotes and being able to match them to pretty backgrounds. It would help me feel better if I was ever down. Now it’s awful. Since I don’t have the money for premium, it has started repeating quotes. I’m not getting any new ones. Also, it has taken away all the backgrounds. They used to all be available to everyone. Then they limited it to a few, and the rest are only for premium users. Okay, I thought, that makes sense. They have to make money somehow. Now though, they’ve taken away all the backgrounds. Unless they give some serious thought to how much they limit on the app, I would not recommend it. No new quotes? Fine I guess. I can add my own to some different backgrounds. But no new quotes OR backgrounds, literally what the ENTIRE APP is supposed to be for? No thanks."
3,Øriginal Donut,"As a person going through tough times I already believe as though these quotes won’t really help but I wanted to give them a try. The first minute I joined they were already asking me to purchase their premium. I’m sorry but you can just search up quotes on your own and set them on your reminders for free instead of purchasing this app. Although some of the free quotes I have read are very good and inspiring. I wish i could have more of that without having to pay. They do give a 3 day trial but I don’t think it’s worth it to pay for quotes you can search up on Pinterest or Google.   It’s a good app and a good idea, although I personally believe it’ll be cheaper and easier to search up your own quotes and set them as reminders on your phone for free."
2,NJGodfather,"This app is absolutely amazing. Love the motivational/inspirational quotes. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seems like almost every day, reminders fail to come through. I have to go into the app, turn them off, then back on again for them to work. If not for this, absolutely a 5 star app.  Update: I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times, still stops sending reminders. It’s to a point where even when I turn reminders off then on it doesn’t even work. Changed my review from 4 to 2 stars. Only reason I give 2 is because when it works, I love the quotes. Will not be renewing and looking for something that I don’t have to keep checking if I will get what I paid for."
4,Wordgrlj,"I think this is a great app and has great collections of motivational quotes with a wide variety of categories to choose from.  My only issue is when you save or favorite a quote and want to go back to it, the list is sorted alphabetically. I have no idea what the first letter of these quotes are and as my favorite list has gotten quite long it’s almost impossible to find specific quotes I may have liked in the past.  I hope there are some updates coming soon to improve the favorite functionality. Other than that I recommend this app for sure!  it’s helped me get through some really down and depressing rough times."
5,finch is perfict,"Ok first off this app is great and there are personalized quotes, but let’s get on topic. The Lock Screen widget Doesn’t work on all Apple phones, like the iPod touch 7th gen. Which makes absolutely zero sense because it’s the same company, so why is this limited to the $400 iPhones! Which is unfair because maybe you can’t afford one and the iPod 7th gen. is worth about half the price! And maybe thats why but let’s say you have kids, that is a great starter phone for kids! So the app isn’t bad if it sounds like that but I wrote that on this review because it’s the app I noticed it on. But I still recommend this :)"
5,Toni&@$,"This app makes me feel so strong, loved, appreciated, beautiful and so much more! It helps me feel happier and I love quotes so much. And when u sign in this app will ask something along the lines of what do u want to improve on in Ur Life. I Pocket everything because u can alway improve on anything! I didn’t mean to pick self-esteem because I don’t have very much self-doubt, but I think it’s good to hear something positive about you even if you don’t think somethings wrong with you or anything like that.  This app has inspired me for the better and to do the better in life! I LOVE THIS app!!!!!!"
5,Lanegan S,"Very well designed and versatile in the aspect of the app’s layout and design, for you can choose app format, color, style, etc. Seems to have an endless amount of free content. And the most important and best part in my opinion is the limitation of ads. With this app being free, it does a good job of keeping ads very discrete and limited.  They have motivational quotes and phrases for numerous categories of all sorts, however, some come with a cost, which is not very expensive to begin with. Overall a great app and very designed, I never leave reviews for apps but this one is an exception for its wonderful design and logistics."
5,nvrthernlights,"I am working so hard to make sure I keep my mental and physical health in check during these hard times.. and then I found this app. I initially had 0 intention on purchasing a subscription but I started using the app every single day, and the customization options and the collection creator functions are beyond awesome. I make it a point to send everyone I speak to every day 2 motivational quotes in the morning and 2 at night :) I also use your other apps. The affirmation one is just as impressive. Keep up the great work. It’s helping so many people out there."
2,Roseyposey56892,"I wanted to love this app. I like the interface, I like the idea. But the content completely misses the mark. The messages are full of invalidation and toxic positivity. For example, “whatever you’re worrying about right now, forget it” and “kill your enemies with a smile” — like… what? Right now, it’s displaying the text “Be happy. It drives people crazy.” This feels like it’s fueling a competitive and revenge-seeking narrative, not helpful motivation. It’s been proven by research that toxic positivity actually makes people feel worse (as opposed to validation, which makes them feel seen and understood). I suggest the developers hire copywriters who actually know human psychology. The only reason I’m giving this any stars is because the interface is well done. The content is garbage."
5,Dance together,This helped me get through a really hard time. I had problems with seeing my body as a bad shape and really wanting a model body. Little did I know I had just that but I saw all of the imperfections. This app had SUCH inspirational quotes and made me feel so warm and happy inside! You have the option to go premium and you can also change wallpapers by watching a 20 second ad. I don’t have premium but I still love it! Premium doesn’t make you wish that you had it. It’s just there for an option!  Please please please get this app! You can even add widgets to your Home Screen!!!   Lots of love ❤️
5,Chris4tennis,"I struggle with severe anxiety and depression. I downloaded this app and used the free version which was great, but I loved the app so much I HAD to pay for premium, especially at the low cost of $20 annually. You can customize the types of quotes you want to receive and it’s very very specific. I set this to alert me 8x a day with a quote (a bit excessive some might think, but I need it.) I would say every single day, a minimum of 6 alerts I receive are applicable to me and my situations and even if for just a few minutes makes me feel seen and validated. This little app has a positive impact on my daily life and the struggles it brings. Thanks so much!!!"
5,dancegymnastqueen,When I was scrolling through Snapchat today someone posted one of the quotes on this app and I was like “woah i should try this.” So I went ahead and downloaded the app. All the quotes on this app just makes me feel better about myself. All the time i say im so ugly or that im so dumb but people always tell me im very very pretty and smart. But that just doesnt make me feel better about it. But this app just makes me feel so self-assured. So every morning when I wake up I will go on this app for about 5 minutes and I will do the same before I go to bed at night. I love this app and I will definitely tell my friends and family about this app as well.
5,Arden Staiger,"I personally love this app and would recommend it to anyone! It was recommended to me by a friend and so I tried it out. You can change the background of your quotes in the app which I thought was fun and some other kinds of quotes are available to use with use of watching an add. While yes, I would enjoy it more if EVERYTHING was unlocked I still find it a very helpful and reassuring thing. You do have to pay to get all the different kinds of quotes but with the way I experience this app I pay for it because I find it helpful. I personally love this app and would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Steve's Apple TV,"Even when I’m having a few bad days or things are not going my way I tend to scroll through the motivational app and find it speaks directly to me and my current circumstance. Now, that doesn’t happen even time but when it does it’s like I feel like I can be a better, stronger more confident man for my woman, friends, fellow veterans and family members.  Give it a try and it might sound corny at first but I guarantee you it’ll generate a better feeling inside of you of self-worth, a better quality human being and just gives you more of an “I can tackle the world” outlook."
5,WOW!!🤩😍🤩,"This app was just uplifting! I’ve been in some drama and times where I’ve felt very down so I just go to the Motivation App and it always makes me feel better. One of my favorite quotes were:” It’s so sad to think that you know how fake someone is, yet everyone likes then because they put on a good show.” There are so many other simply AMAZING quotes in there and two of my friends actually got the app because I sent a quote to them. That’s a fraction of how good the app is.( Although, I dot really like how many times the app keeps on asking for premium.) Otherwise, it’s absolutely perfect.😌"
3,Seajewels,"I’ve been a loyal user of I Am for a long time. I heard about this app and tried it out and like some of the categories and thought about switching over. For example I like the Entrepreneurs category and set it up as my watch category but the watch complication for Motivation ignores all settings.  Very disappointing because I Am worked perfectly and I love it on my watch. Instead, on my watch I seem to get a random mix of general Motivation themes including ones I find cheesy and off putting about love or external beauty. I’ve tried restarting, reinstalling, submitting a ticket, but no go. This one will have to be uninstalled until I find out the issue is fixed."
3,mysnorninglittlepup:),"I downloaded this app hoping to get an everyday, self motivator. Wanting it to be easy to use, and a good app all in all. And that’s exactly what I got. Although, my expectations were a bit higher than what I got. It annoys me that I have to buy myself motivation. I wish this app was different then all the other apps out there, but it’s sadly not. For someone not willing to spend the money, I wouldn’t recommend downloading this app. It’s your average day to day app, trying to get money off you. I guess I have mixed feelings. I like it, and I don’t like it. Like I said it’s average.   *I will give the app credit though. The minimal quotes that you do get, when you don’t pay, are quite inspiring. One of the few things I like about the app.  Just don’t get your hopes up."
5,ghgrecbjyedkj,"I abousloutly love this app it’s so simple yet one of the best things I have ever done for myself there have been so many times were I was at my lowest and didn’t know how to escape toxic relationships and abusive friendships, just by a simple quote on my phone I would suddenly find myself .I went from someone who’s hobby was a mix of bed rotting and constant suicidal thoughts to someone with actual friends and a stable mental health and I know I can’t just say that some random quoting app saved my life but I don’t think I could have gotten were I am now without that small push ."
5,lady2xtraazz,I have been having such a rough week i literally almost gave up on everything. Something told me to just type in motivation on my App Store because I was going to sit there and download every motivational speech app then boom a app literally called motivation was just sitting right in front of me. Now whoever created this app literally needs to find me and give me a hug. Every motivation feels so personal like it’s no way this message is NOT for me. You can also choose how many times a day you need to be motivated lol i have mines on ten I love it! Thank you to whoever created this seriously.
4,lexia dogies,"I love this app as an athlete I need motivation when I have hard days. But there is a few things I would like to say.1) I noticed there are no sports motivational quotes about gymnastics and I know there are some out there like “A trophy carries dust but memories last forever” -Mary Lou Retton. 2) there are no gymnastics themed backgrounds either. As you can tell gymnastics is my sport I am a competitive gymnast level 9 and I would love to have some quotes that are related to my sport! Other than those things this app is truly awesome and I hope you take my ideas into mind and make this app more enjoyable for gymnasts like me. Thanks so much I’m looking forward to seeing if my ideas are put into the app.   Sincerely, Layla"
4,EscapeTM,"This app has some pretty great quotes and many I have even wrote down. Great variance in quotes and certainly doesn’t make you want to feel bad for yourself, rather the opposite. It really makes you own your choices and start improving your life. The only reason I rated it four stars instead of five is because a quote came up and said “It is okay to have depression, it is okay to have anxiety…blah…blah…blah.” In which case I strongly disagree, and completely undermines the standpoint that was shown previously. Unfortunately, because of this quote I had to delete the app, because I did not want any negative thoughts seeping into what mindset I have created.  Resist The Slave Mind."
5,CowPot,"I am beyond thankful for this app. I don’t know how it works and the mystery behind it knowing how I need to see the quotes that help me at my worst time, but it does just that. It is currently helping me through a difficult situation and it’s the cheerleader I didn’t know I had. Popping up throughout my day, and telling me the truths I need to hear, giving me tough love, and reminding me to value myself. Thank you. I used to have the paid version, and when my situation improves, I’ll be paying for it again. It’s definitely worth it. Thank you for changing lives and caring enough to make this app."
5,Tj ⭐️,I just got this app about 10 min ago and I already love it. The app has so many cool features In it like changing the app icon to personalizing your own quotes. You really can make the app your own and find a sense of comfort because the app is all about you and what you make of it.  Anything you are going through in life this app will help you. For example if you deal with low confidence levels or self esteem or just feeling like your not good enough take some time in this app to relax you will truly start to feel better and love yourself   Don’t listen to me anymore go explore this yourself you won’t regret it 🙂⭐️
2,sepbrown555,"As much as I love this app, I’m not gonna give it anything more than 2 or 3 stars until I stop having to redo ALL of my widgets every time there’s an update! As soon as there’s an update, they all get blacked out and all of your apps this is the only one that does that. Why? I pay yearly for premium, so I expect better service than this. I have 4 widgets on my screen 3 on my lock screen.  I spend time making them bc I use them, look at them and read to them daily. So I guess I’ll spend another 45 minutes to an hour remaking them all from scratch and losing everything that I’ve built up in my collections once again!  And of course, as soon as I finish rebuilding them, it won’t they work right away and I’ll have to go through this 2 or 3 times with each individual widget until the app decides to make my personalization stick. Being able to personalize these widgets is really the only reason I pay for premium. If this doesn’t get fixed by the next time I have to renew my subscription, I’m gonna quit paying for premium. Maybe I should just cancel my subscription and ask for a refund…"
2,Sariah Lily,"I love this app, I have had it for months now, but I recently subscribed for the free trial. I forgot that I had subscribed to the free trial and I realized one day after it ended, so now I’m being charged almost 30$. As a student in college, 30$ is a good bit of money to accidentally spend. I’ve been trying to find a way to reach out to get a refund, as it doesn’t show up as refundable, for some reason, and it also says it does not have a receipt, which I found odd. Would someone be able to reach out to me to help me figure out this problem? I was unable to find a number to call to discuss this. Once again, great app! Love using it, but I would also love being able to figure out this accidental purchase."
3,Katenyt,"I would like to know why it sometimes gets into a loop where it either just shows a picture without quote, or pulls a couple of quotes and just keeps repeating them. That is frustrating but not enough to cancel my subscription. Also, I choose the pics I want to rotate through and they also add some I have not chosen. Again, a bit frustrating as well.  This has been something I have mentioned before but it hasn’t been fixed and is getting more prevalent.  The pictures are beautiful and the quotes inspiring, I just wish you would fix the problems mentioned. Maybe I should explore other options when my subscription is up."
4,um it is ok i guss,"I wish there were more options for the backgrounds that were free because I’m just not watching an ad every time I want it change my background. AND if I watch an ad for another background, it doesn’t save that the previous background that I had, had been watched already! The ads really bring it down. I understand you have to make money, but please give us a few free options. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this, the app is awesome and makes me feel happy with myself other than all the ads, have a great day and remember that you are awesome!"
1,K.L Dawn,"First off, I don't write reviews and I don't particularly read them either, but I really want this company to know how much they've aided me, in the only 3 DAYS I've had it. I got the trial of the premium version and I'm about to upgrade to the yearly subscription, (It's only a dollar a month!!) Now, I'm not one for quotes usually, at least not the kind that are supposed to make you happier, because they tend to just be a ton of toxic positivity. But so far, every quote I've gotten has fit perfectly with what I'm feeling. It's honestly kind of crazy how conveniently they appear. One thing I'd like to see is an option to save a mix. As in, I want to be able to have a ""Sad Mix"" Where it has all my ones for happiness and stuff and then like a "" motivation"" one that I can switch between.   Beautiful app! Keep up the good work!"
5,Dint guve up,Once I got on this app I thought like my mind and my body just changed because since I’ve been play on the app and making my own I thought to my self hey what kind of person am I am right now what kind could I be with this like app even though I have a times in my life I feel like I can express myself with these kind of emotions and just like put my bad side out away and make my good side come out i’m only writing this that way I can like say stuff that I’ve been through and my part of my family my part of my family left me it’s hard but this app I can express myself and yeah
1,GamahRulz,I hate it when all I’m looking for is a motivational quote but every time I open the app all I see is that you want me to give you money. I understand you need to ‘make money’ but I don’t understand why you had to do this to literally every category and literally every theme. This app is supposed to be a feel-good type thing but all I’m getting from it is that you want my money. Also stop saying things like “aLmoSt eVerYthIng oN tHis aPp iS fREe” when people complain that you have to pay to enjoy the app. There are literally TWO THINGS that you don’t have to pay for which is downloading the app and the crappy general quotes section. The quotes here are not inspirational at all and should not be sloppily picked. This app is WAAAAY over rated and I think you should stop lying to your customers and lying to people looking at the reviews.
2,Morley379,"See title. I would’ve previously given this app 4 stars (taking off one because of what I consider high cost for limited function) but I have to reduce that rating considerably because I am no longer able to dislike a quote that shows up. It’s really frustrating, as new quotes show up randomly in my widgets, which I generally enjoy, but sometimes these random quotes are just things that I totally disagree with or from people I dislike. I want to be able to have the opportunity to select the dislike button to ensure they don’t come up again, which I used to be able to do, but now cannot. The like button is still there, so I really see no reason why there is no longer a dislike."
1,Someday Something,"If your idea of “motivation” is having an app send you Tupac lyrics and grammatically incorrect posts mined from Facebook about not letting haters get you down with the occasional stoic peppered in, then this app is for you. I’ve tried to appropriately tweak the settings to my liking but it all ends up being the same. I downloaded the free three-day trial on a whim after “swiping up” on an IG ad. It was decent enough. Thought it would be okay to have a quote here and there break up my day so I didn’t cancel. But now that it’s something I actually spent money on, I’m just notified and reminded several times a day about how angry I am that I paid for this. Edit: a couple hours after I wrote this review I received a banner notification for a motivational quote that read: “stop reading inspirational quotes and get to work.” Great advice! I just canceled my subscription."
5,Pretty pink cupcake,"I love this app because it gives me interesting, positive and uplifting quotes for each day!!! also, I love how you can pick from different categories each and every day! The only downfall of this app is when I send a quote from this app, it comes out as monkey taps. I think this issue could be fixed on The technical aspect. I use VoiceOver and it still comes out as monkey taps. I’ve talked to other people who aren’t blind or visually impaired and they say it still comes out as monkey taps. That’s the only reason I’m not giving this app five stars."
4,MisterJackamo,"I’ve been using this app for at least two or three years on all of my devices, including the Apple TV. The only issue I have at all is with the Apple TV app. You have to scroll through every theme in order to pick one and it resets every time I exit the app or restart my device. I typically use it as a screensaver on both of my TVs so there is one specific thing that I always use and is tedious to find. It would be nice to have a drop down the menu that allows you to just select the background without having to keep clicking. Or at least a way to set a default wallpaper."
5,Roni Loves Zoe,"I normally think that motivational quotes and self help stuff is a bunch of bull, but when I downloaded this it really helped boost my motivation and make my day better and all in all more productive. The quotes help me get out of bed and get my crap together. Even though I haven’t paid for all the features I am still happy with the product I was given, which is rare for apps where you pay for features. Overall you’ve managed to turn a lazy, someone chaotic person into a more chill and put together one. Thanks again!"
5,jerryisbomb.com,"I always think “it’s just me”. It’s just me who’s not happy. It’s just me who can’t think positive. It’s just me who is struggling with this negative obstacle. I have deleted every social media within the past year and I keep having these urges to tap on an app that’s no longer there. My therapist informed me of using this app because my negative thoughts are more powerful than my good ones right now. And let me tell you, I’m getting addicted to tapping on this app and reading motivational, supporting, kind, words that my mind won’t say on its own. Soon I feel these words will come naturally with this help I have."
5,Pretty girls12345678910,"I truly love this app. It has great quotes. Before I got this app, I had a lot of self-doubt.(I’m a perfectionist) After reading a bunch of the quotes, I started to feel better about myself! I figured that things just take time and nobody’s perfect. So yeah, I still have my days where I just feel out of it, but when I do, I just think of a quote and shake it off. It really helps and I have become a more positive person because of it. Thank you for making this app! (The themes and fonts are cool too!)  -Follow your passion. Listen to your heart. Trust the process. Be grateful. Life is magic and your dreams matter.   From the Motivation app"
5,Ashamoley,"I love this app. I was bummed out that users who Don't pay for a package; are limited to a very small selection of fonts and styles; for the quotes, they deliver every day. it turns out the quotes and motivation it delivers behind the way it may look or attract my attention, I'm still intrigued by the meaning of each one I connected to.  Turns out if you're just loyal and show appreciation for an app; that truly affects your mood and reaction to the day; they will reward you will FREE fonts and backgrounds! So not only are you receiving a positive, motivational, pick-me-up for the day"
5,"Ann ""D""","I would not have believed the impact that this app has had on my tutored students. Most have not been successful in a high-stakes licensure exam. A very frustrating place to be for them as well as an opportunity to their lower self-esteem and self-confidence, and imply they have not selected the correct life-long passion ad a profession. Ever student is advised in my initial slide of the introductory session to ”Download the Motivation app”. All have done do and either spontaneously expressed how wonderful Motivation is in getting prepared for their next exam sitting, or express the same when I ask. So kudos!!"
5,Danielle Jagen,"By far the most dependable app! Every widget I’ve used so far has not compared to this one, every saying is different and truly inspiring and just when I thought this app could not get any better, I realized it’s been saving all of my favorite quotes whenever I hit like! Incredible. The app is beautiful and minimal design, I love it! Whether you want quotes from Bill Gates to Lil Wayne - it’s all there and customizable!    👍🏼❤️ I just want to say thank you to the team for creating this app, you bring so much joy to my day.🤗"
2,Player_1909,"This is a great app. It can give you notifications throughout the day with some inspiring words. And I’ll say that it was great… at first. But they constantly try to upsell you on their premium version, and once you’ve seen most of the quotes, they’re just gonna start repeating, and the notifications become more of an interruption. After all, a quote isn’t exactly touching when you’ve seen it for the fifth time. As well as this, there are a few quotes that make no sense whatsoever. One of these that I get sent to me surprisingly often, is “Basketball is Basketball”, and I don’t get how that’s relevant at all. Overall, good app at first, but once you’ve seen all the quotes, you’ll likely stop paying attention to the notifications."
5,Ozzy_q8,"I used to suffer from chronic stress and anxiety and a friend recommended this app to me which I downloaded. During days where I was hopeless, I would receive the most calming words and almost instantly, my symptoms disappear. This has been happening for month and I proudly could confirm that life is much much more colorful thanks to this useful source that surrounded me with so much love and gratitude and to appreciate every peace of life “regardless” of our daily stressors. Sincerely, I highly recommend and worth every penny for what it could do to our emotional stability!"
5,JThurman1256,"I absolutely love this app. It always knows exactly what to tell me whether that be something to up my mood or a quote that will steer me in the right direction. There is someway somehow that this app always tells me exactly what I need to hear then not only that, but you have the option to pay and then be able to customize it, so you can change the background or you can change the category to several different ideas. Would definitely recommend to family and friends, some I already have."
1,FrustratedQueen2019,"ANYBODY ELSE HAVING THIS TROUBLE??  ***Here’s the reason why I’m not giving a great review right now….. Very often, the widget gets stuck and goes back to saying the following which is not related at all to the topics that I choose: “Do more of what makes you happy.” I get very tired of seeing that saying randomly showing up on the widget at least 85% of the time. And it’s very frustrating when I have chosen a completely different unrelated topic.   This has been going on now at least two months.  I will be upfront and say I use the cost free version, but I’m up to date on software and app versions. What’s frustrating is I’ve loved this app every since a friend shared it with me several months ago. I use the widget on my home screen. I keep an eye on when updates to the app are offered. I often restart my phone as well as refresh the app from running in the background. I have an iPhone 14 Plus. I do change the background of the app screen often as well as the topic option.  But this repetitiveness of the same saying over the past couple or more months is ANNOYING!!  Please fix this developers!!!!"
5,Awkward Rube,"The app itself is great but I paid for a year of premium in September but it expired in JANUARY. They made it impossible to reach out to customer service and the only suggestion their site offered was to ""pay again and request a refund"" - how would I do that when there's no way to contact customer service? Why would I even TRUST I'd get a refund when they've cheated me out of more than half the year I've paid for??? Don't pay for this app, just use the free version!!!"
5,embell2468,"I’ve had this app for a while. I don’t pay for premium right now(I may look into it), but when the quote pops up I feel like so often it seems to be just what I need and it is like it knows what I am going through. I have been really thankful recently for the uplifting quotes, encouragement, insightful, positive messages/quotes. Not too often or annoying either. Pretty cool! ( : helps me stay mindful sometimes and puts things in perspective or just kinda gives me a little boost of encouragement, or sometimes care/support. Pretty great!"
3,Robertmagness,"I took the chance and purchased the lifetime app. I’m happy with the quotes in general and the structure, and will be a passive user. However there are a lot of quotes that I would like to add so that I see those on a regular basis. Since I go between three iOS devices, I want to see a similar experience on all. So far I don’t see this app as being one that cloud syncs to give the same experience in all my devices. I believe this should definitely be part of the value of the app. Willing to give it five stars if that can happen. It is definitely worth taking away 2 stars for that lack of feature since that is such a critical feature on almost all apps."
4,AngieBangie15,"I love the app, the quotes, and the reminders I can set up for different topics during different times of the day and I can add the frequency of when I receive a quote. I like getting the notification on my phone with a new quote. I don’t always click the notification but I always read them. After a certain point the reminders stop and I have to go back into the app to reset the reminders. It’s annoying having to go into the app when the reminders stop and setting it back up. Why does there need to be a limit before I reset the reminders to keep coming? I don’t like that it stops after a certain timeframe."
5,iPhone User One,"PLEASE STOP ASKING FOR MY NAME!! Every. Time. I. Open. The. App.  This app has truly great quotes, curated (I think) just like a Pandora station. However the ads are REALLY ANNOYING, and I tried the “7-Day Free Trial” but was charged immediately. I got Apple to give me a refund by disputing the issue. Shady business practices, and now they think it’s cute to ask you for your name so they can customize quotes with your name. Sure. Cool idea. ONCE. ONLY ASK ME ONCE. AND THEN WHEN I DECLINE YOUR INVITATION TO GIVE OUT MY NAME, STOP ASKING!!! Fix this, and I’ll raise my rating to 3 stars for great quotes (-2 for the ads and charging money for a free trial)."
5,kb492785,"Just the encouragements and reminders I needed for the areas in my life where I struggle.  Reinforces many of the things my therapist tells me.   It’s perfect that you actually get to pick the topics and then save those that really speak to you in a collection.  I love that I get these motivations throughout the whole day to bring my thoughts back to where I am *trying to train them to be.   I’ve been rereading the day’s quotes at night and, as a former teacher, like being able to review them once again."
5,petitepiggy,"Love this app! You can tailor it- the frequency of push notifications (daily, per hour, etc), the type (career, relationships, depression, etc).   You can get push notifications, in addition to just opening the app and flipping through quotes. Sometimes when I’m feeling down, I’ll open the app and flip through it  I’ve recommended it to friends and they find it helpful, too. One friend who looked at it thought it would be annoying, but after downloading it she said it’s actually a nice app  If you “like” certain quotations, then it starts learning your preferences and will send you more quotations you’ll like  The only negative is that only 2 lines of text show up in the push notification. When I try to expand the notification, it still only shows 2 lines. Text message and news notifications can be expanded. Not a dealbreaker, just annoying  Great, free app! Thanks for making this ❤️"
4,kristysmom01,"I’ve tried repeatedly to report this through the app but it is not allowing me to do so. Twice now I have gotten a terrific discounted offer to sign up for an annual subscription. When I try to click through to purchase it, however, it says there’s a problem and to try again later. Later never comes! I have had the free version for over a year and I love it. I was ready to take the plunge but it won’t let me purchase! I hope the developer sees this, because when I went through the app to try to report it it says “contact us” but there’s no way to do so."
5,Steph 1675,I absolutely LOVE Motivation! They always know exactly what I need to hear. I can’t imagine NOT having this app. I am the director of an assisted living community and covid has been challenging to say the least. This app has been the only thing keeping me smiling on some days. I have their other app as well and I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT BOTH OF THEM! Please give it a try and I assure you that you will not be disappointed. We could all use more positivity in our lives and MOTIVATION IS THE BEST!!  Thank you to the amazing people at Motivation. You are responsible for more smiles than you know❤️
5,gssiler7,"I don’t usually rate apps, and I definitely don’t take time to write reviews so I’ll keep it short. This app is so “on time” with quotes, or telling me the right things when I need them it’s ridiculous. It never fails; when I’m going through something or getting down on myself, *buzz* here’s a notification giving me some sort of advice or reassurance that I could definitely use at that moment. I screenshot certain ones to go back and look at. I recommend anyone to download this app whether you need a push to start something or to keep going."
5,superior void,my phone is beyond annoying when it comes to everyday function. The bare minimum a phone should do is call yet my phone doesn’t do that. Next thing is navigating through the applications itself yet this phone is slow when it come to a time when I need it to run at the right speed. I will have lots of glory smashing this phone to bits and pieces but for the meantime I’ll have this app to keep my patience and enjoy the little messages that pop up on my lock screen.
5,His Rose,I cannot tell you how much I love this app. It is my absolute favorite app that I downloaded in a very long time and I look forward to getting my notifications from it all day long. The only negative thing I can say about it is that sometimes the clothes I should be good to certain historical figures that I know did not see them. I’d rather they were left anonymous then to be attributed to the wrong person. Other than that I think this app is fantastic I share with all of my friends and I really appreciate those of you that developed and produce such a wonderful tool. thank you.
5,pokipethater,I use the free version of this app but I absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone! I use the widget on my lock screen and get a new quote almost every time I turn on my phone.  I struggle with depression so I often have little to no motivation whatsoever.  As a person who loves all kinds of quotes this app always gives me a little push in the right direction and helps me to see that everything will be okay. This is amazing for people of all ages that are struggling or just appreciate little friendly reminders!
5,Eduh2004,"I downloaded “motivation” before because I saw it on an advertisement and thought it was cool… however, I truly did not know how much of an impact this app would have on life, getting me through difficult situations and keeping me humble when everything is well. It has helped me grow over time. I particularly love the fact that you can customize the type of quotes that you receive, therefore accommodating for any type of situation. It makes you human, and helps you become your trust self. 10/10 recommend."
2,ADay125,"I paid for a subscription, for I especially find this frustrating, that every time the app updates the widget goes blank on my phone. For days/weeks at a time. I delete the widget till the new update rolls around to see if it fixes the issues. Lately I haven’t gotten any daily quotes to me, and I set it up to send me multiple quotes a day. Again, that’s just frustrating as a paid subscriber. I normally don’t leave reviews, but this seems to be a constant issue lately and so I felt I needed to say something. Other than that, it’s been a great app, I typically get some perfect quotes throughout my day, some come to me, right in the moment that I need to hear them.."
5,💖TaylorSan💖,"okay so i didn’t expect much lol but as soon as i checked it out i was like, WOW. it’s sooo nice just to have and i hope that it will help me. if your struggling with anything, mental heath wise or just problems this is so great to help you get through it. also it has something for everyone religion wise which i thought was literally awesome! the only thing i would change would be the fact that there’s premium but you can still do a lot of stuff without having to pay. overall 10/10 would recommend❤️"
5,name that no one knows!!,"I know that there are so many people in the world that look down on themselves. I used to be one of them. I dowloaded this app after i read a couple reviews and saw that so many people loved it. And know i do. It gives you so many good quotes and a wide variety. You can pick the way your app looks and like as many quotes that you want. I’ve had such a good experience using it, it’s helped my mental health soooo much. I definitely think that you should down load this app if you need just a little motivation."
5,Michels,"I’m not a wealthy man. Every dollar I make, goes toward my mental and physical therapies. I was beaten and raped by two male predators for years. One of them was my father and he was a preacher, ultimately never punished. In 2007, I was hit and flipped by two trucks while sitting at a stoplight. My walking and sleep patterns were worse after the accident than when I told the authorities about losing my childhood. I feel pain 24 hours a day, but just to see the reminders on my iPhone 11 and my Apple Watch that I’m still a human being like everyone else is going to make life worth living in these dark times."
4,ghikl1234457,"This app is all in all amazing!!!! It gives really great motivational quotes and inspiring sayings! But it is really a pain when some of the categories that I would like to look at are locked!!! And another thing that makes me a little frustrated is that when you make a theme it only stays there for when your scrolling through the quotes, and when u don’t want that theme anymore it gets lost and you can’t get it back. If the developer is looking at this your app is very good and very helpful and inspiring but the other complaints I have are minor and are just little things that improve on the app."
5,ClayCharlesLancaster,"Having a reminder that I’m important in some way and reminding me I have worth 10 times a day helps me dramatically. Especially with my mental health at the moment. And really my whole life. I just thank the makers of this app because they are helping me to keep going. I’m fighting for my Son, Getting mental health at the moment, dealing with stalking by my Ex and her assaulting me numerous times and getting away with it. My Son is my number 1 and I could keep writing however I just want to say this app truly is a grateful thing I appreciate. Thank you guys."
5,addictited to this APP!!!,"These quotes help me get motivated anytime I feel down or I need something to read. This app reads my mind as well, like if I am feeling down from a specific situation it gives me a quote that goes along with the situation. Amazing just amazing thank you so much for making this app it makes my day!   But there’s one thing I dislike about the app, please make it free!!!! I really love the app don’t get me wrong but please make the options of if you want to let say choose something that has to do with money please make that option free please make all your apps free🙏🏻"
5,Diva E!,"This app was a game-changer for my personal development. I wanted to make my own mix of topics for inspiration, so I upgraded to the premium version (annual subscription is very affordable). The number of topics to choose from is incredible! I chose around 30 based upon what I’m currently working on (the app continues to increase areas of topics). Then you can choose from over many themes (background pics) with different fonts, and lastly set the number of times it notifies you (I selected 4x a day). I have 100+ apps and this is my very favorite!"
5,Deonna Vivinetti,This app is awesome it gives you the most inspirational quotes! And it helps you get through hard times like it did for me I have been having tests in school and every time I get a quote it makes me feel more relaxed and ready to make it through them! I told a lot of people about this app even teachers and they love it!!! I told them to make sure they spread the app to people because I know it will get them through the day. Thank you so much for this app and I hope this helps you all out! Also this app has inspired me to make my own!
5,Mark.S10001,"This app is amazing and I’m not just a person paid to say this but I’m an actual person who believes it. I downloaded this app and it inspires me to keep going no matter what, it literally said that no joke. Now don’t get me wrong there is a lot of things locked off to people who don’t want to pay but, I think this is worth it because I haven’t paid a dime and it as helped me through a lot. So I completely recommend this app hands down, it’s one of those apps that knows what to say at the right time, some how. So if you read this, download it, and thank me later."
4,Donnylvrz,I’ve been using this app for about a month and I’ve been really enjoying it with all its great quotes and there are so many options of what kind of quotes you would like to receive and the backdrop you want to use when reading them. I also like the fact that you can write your own and I appreciate this feature because I like to write especially when something positive comes along. The one thing I would suggest is if an edit button can be added not sure if there is one already but I couldn’t find it. If there would be one then it would be 5 stars easy!
5,Apple ◡̈,"一次偶然的下载便让我无数次在梦里回想，并悔恨当初为何卸载。经过我找回AppleID的密码并恢复数据后在1000多个购买记录中寻找到你，感谢我们缘分未断，感谢能够再次相遇。软件什么都好就是有一点价格太贵，能不能便宜点。最后真诚的祝愿开发者身体健康，祝Motivation越来越好。   A casual download made me think back countless times in my dreams and regret why I uninstalled it in the first place. After I retrieved my AppleID password and recovered my data, I found you in more than 1,000 purchase records, thank you for our unbroken fate, thank you for meeting again. Software is good is a little too expensive, can it be cheaper. Finally, I sincerely wish the developers good health and wish Motionivation better and better."
1,Dg5301,"I have the (iam) app. I was offered this bundle for $59 for this app a 3 others. At first I was allowed to choose any options, but now I’m allowed 2-3 choices and all the others are locked unless I pay each one the full price for an annual subscription. So what in the world did I pay for? What a disappointment and it shows how little respect and care these developers actually have for people. It’s all about the money $. Of course no one gives refunds right. So I can just cancel my subscription and leave this review to worn others. It sounded good. The apps looked good but it’s all a lie. You get a minimum of things while getting bombarded to get the premium version of each and every app!?!? Good grief. Save yourself some money and aggravation."
3,Tamiyakn,"So the quotes are good and helpful. It does what it’s supposed to do, however, my widget stops working on my homescreen and it becomes a black or white square with nothing on it. It has also gotten stuck on one quote, while it was working, for a consecutive amount of days. This is frustrating because why does it do this?? I also pay for premium. What am I paying for if I keep having to deal with annoying and unnecessary issues with this app. I am tempted to cancel my subscription because they’re taking my money and I deal with these glitches a little too frequently."
4,Gio Cisneros,"Hello,  I really enjoy receiving different words of wisdoms from pop references to literature. Only problem is that currently for this particular App on iOS 16.0.2 the notification banner doesn’t go away like the other phones or apps. It has to be manually swiped in order for it to be dismissed. This means that if I don’t dismiss it, it stays on my screen until it has been taken care of. Which is very odd as it keeps my screen on and blocks other notifications from showing up.   Any useful help to fix this would be much appreciated! Thank you!"
5,endablank,"Can be a bit aggressive with quotes at times but honestly helped a lot to get me out of a panic attack after the quote kinda hurt my feelings😂 but honestly, I swear it listens in and sees what you send because its almost like a widget therapist. 10/10 but if they hurt your feelings ignore it until they make sense, because it will make sense. Just remember that the one person that you can rely on 100% is yourself, and that you can choose who you allow to hurt you. Don’t negative self talk because it can cause more mental damage than a person close to you. You’ve got this 💕"
3,Pariah.pariah,"After a long year of depression and deciding to try new things to get me out of this umpf I’ve been in.. this App reminded me how I used to think when my days were simple as a teen. Um I love the app yes but ,do it think it’s worth to pay for ? … (no) 😂The reminders every day that I received at random time helped me pick my head up helped me keep going honestly this should be a free app for people who are in need. I rate it a three star because I love the concept of it but I don’t like that  this app profiting of me trying to find peace again or trying to grow out of my sorrow. Definitely would recommend if it was a free app. 🤷🏾‍♀️😂"
3,TheStevess,"Love everything about the app but keep dealing with the widget working for a little while, completely random times, then black box indefinitely. Tried deleting the widget, tried adding every type of widget under every scenario I could think of, but more often than not it’s just the black box. Thought that after a few weeks, 1-2 iOS updates and a handful of app update releases it’d be fixed but still not working so leaving this review in hopes that it’ll be addressed. 5 stars otherwise for sure! (Only reason I use it is for the widget, as I imagine many people do)"
5,YRCR916,Contacted them about an issue i had with an update. They responded quick and ended up fixing the issue. For that i will continue being a motivation premium user and will support them until the end. Recommend this app to anyone going through hard times or simply just need motivation. It has helped me ever since I got it. The widget is great you will always see a quote with that on your home screen. So many categories to choose from and nice themes and customization options.
5,menelikplopoo,"To be honest it feels good to write inspiring messages for others to see and honestly wants my heart. Also these don’t work unless you look into yourself when your reading this, for example. Quote : Make your dream tomorrow, your normal today. I made this quote myself and basically it means make your dreams a reality. So you have it look into your self and see what you have and how you can work towards or your dreams. You can’t just read this and say this doesn’t motivate you. These are made to motivate you into being motivated to accomplish your goals / dreams."
5,dirtbagbaby,"This app is literally a life saver, and I mean that to the T. I use this app every day that I wake up, hating my self, feeling bad for my self, or having self worry or doubts to overcome all of those negative aspects that this messed up world we live in has to show us. If you ever need an inanimate object to get you through your day, this app would most definitely with no doubts in my mind do the trick for you. I have severe depression as well so this app really brings me up when I’m struggling the most. Very appreciative of this app."
2,Makosgrl,"I purchased the Premium subscription which has you pay for the year all at once-which was no problem. I then canceled the subscription so that I didn’t forget to do it a year from now and get charged again. Once I canceled the future subscription, I lost access to all of the Premium features I had already paid for! I attempted to contact the developer but received no response. I am very disappointed because I actually really enjoy this app but am now only able to access the free categories which is minimal.  My suggestion would be, if you purchase the Premium subscription you might want to set a reminder for a year from now to cancel it so that you do not lose what you paid for."
1,G3MM@23,I purchased the premium but it’s not working. I keep receiving a message stating that I have the free version. I signed in with Apple. I’ve tried to restore but that’s not available it keeps mentioning iTunes but I did not purchase from iTunes so the FAQ is useless. It too bad because I really love the quotes and share them with friends and family. Btw it is only recently that this started happening. I will probably not renew as it costing money to have the free version. Oh here’s an additional piece of information I tried to upgrade to premium thinking that maybe it would realize that I already have it but this was not the case it tried to charge me an additional $29 on top yearly amount paid back in March 2024.
4,SilverSloth8,"Used to be my favorite ❤️ app. I loved the themes and quotes and the widgets actually move like they do in the app. (I got a rain theme!!) anyway, not I’m confused. 😕 I think it’s forcing my to free trial, because it says “ you have earned three days of premium preview “ but then it says “you will not be charged” so like what? 😮 I can’t get into the app, so I’m not sure how to ask support. Would recommend expect for this blip? Update: 5 stars, I realized they were just giving me a little gift! Thanks devs, keep up the good work and I love this app!  Answer to developers: One sec"
5,Kaseygirl11,"I’ve had many tragedies in my family life over the years that could have made me question my faith in God! Each time I remember how faithful God has been and the joy I receive through it ALL! Since relocating to AZ, I’ve never felt so much hatred and envy toward me. All because of my skin color and education. I’ve been called aggressive, mean and other things, which only proves they don’t have a clue who I am and who’s I am! Thanks to the Motivations and of course my relationship with My Almighty Father....I can “wipe my feet at the city gate!” I love my daily Motivation! Kasey"
5,To New beginnings.,This app has helped me a lot with the things that I struggle with. It gives me the confidence and motivation to keep going. I haven’t been in the best spot in my life and has just really helped with giving me the motivation to keep going. When I wake up and I see a quote it tells me that I have to see the good in the world. Some quotes help me with personal issues with all the stress in my life. This app has helped me and so many others in the world because of the things is says to motivate me and others.
5,somebody needs,"This app is just amazing. It has helped me through tough times and something about it saying my name in the quote just makes my day Just it saying “(your name) can do this, I believe in you” makes my day and makes me feel confident. Just scrolling through quotes for 5 min. makes me so happy and I am so happy. The different categories are really good too from anxiety to depression. This app is amazing and you really are missing out if you don’t try it. 10/10"
5,improved mental health!,"So last year I was going through a tough time with depression and other issues, I downloaded this app through an ad I think. Ever since I downloaded it I definitely think it helped a lot. The messages are powerful and I love the unique theme you can chose from. (I use the constellation one) it give quotes from different topics like depression, anxiety, self esteem, break ups, ldr, sexuality, family problems and more! I hope you take this recommendation when considering getting this app it helped a lot with my mental health!"
3,247NRG,"The app started off great but now it doesn’t want to communicate with my phone. I used to receive a quote morning and evening but now, something is wrong. I’ve tried to delete and redownload but nada. I paid 40 for the year and now I’m not too pleased. It’s also glitching when I select the quote to view from my widget on my Home Screen because I like the quote. But once the app opens up that quote I liked disappears and another one is in its place. I try to scroll back to see if it was a previous one and there’s nothing before the app once I open the widget. Please fix the glitches or I will delete."
5,Nubarg,"This app is awesome. Never got a single ad, a request for leaving a review, or anything unrelated to a subtle but often useful and powerful quote or piece of advice to consider throughout the day. I get a couple of updates every day and it has genuinely helped and the notifications aren’t annoying because of the information actually being really thoughtful and relevant. If you’re looking for intelligent motivation and daily advice in your workday, this app won’t let you down. Thank you to the developers for creating it and making it legit free."
3,finnizuwu,"Ive been having a really, really, really hard time lately but i saw this app advertised on instagram and it gave me some hope. However that ended pretty quickly once i figured out you have to pay for almost everything. None of the default quotes make me feel good so i did the custom ones but, well, those arent free to display for the notification feature. Can you guys make more stuff free? Or at least just that? I really like the idea behind this but i think it’d be so much more helpful if more of it were free. I think this app has a lot of potential!  (Also, i really like the small feature where you can change the app icon. Its a nice touch :D)"
5,Fowl.Walton 🥎🥎🥎🥎,"I give this app five whole stars because when I was going through a hard time it gave the motivation to work hard and push through it all you got to do is push the button get on your screen and you will automatically fall in love there are quotes for your break ups, when you are going through some things that you do t want to talk about to anyone be there but this app will open you u and give alittle bit more lead wayGET THIS APP IT IS A LIFE CHANGER!!!!!!!!!LOVE,YOUR FAVORITE FOWLER!!!!!!!"
5,MsSirWinsAlOt,"I am in a horrible relationship at the moment. While I await my escape, friends have suggested this app to me.  I have been using it daily and we even share our favorite quotes with each other. I love that it changes, and I can change the backgrounds to suit my mood.  This is all the free version that I have been using😁✨🥰 Once I am ‘free’ I hope to be able to do premium 😍. If you are reading reviews to see if you want to download this .. I say go for it !"
3,TheNESW,"I’ve officially started trying this app out for the last few days and I absolutely love it. What actually attracted me to the app is that I saw someone using “I Am” (which looks like the same company) affirmations in their Apple Watch as part of the modular. My watch is updated and so I my phone but when I go into the Motivation app to setup the Face for my Apple Watch, it tells me that it can’t do it. If there was a way to fix this, I could absolutely give this five stars. I’ve tried removing and re-adding on both the watch and the phone, rebooting both, etc. Any ideas?"
5,magenSurfs,"Everyday is a new day with the start of my day seeing a quote. Throughout the day I look forward to my quotes because they help keep me going in a my world full of corporate business and insensitive individuals who loom in my life. It helps me as a parent too. Sometimes when I least expect it, a great quote comes up and even when I do expect my notification, they always seem to come at the perfect time. Thank you so much for creating this app and help filling this dreary world with positivity."
5,ElizabethBehm,"Normally I do not write reviews. But this app is very beneficial to me and the different quotes I see motivate me in some way. The content is not stale which is what I like and I am always eager to see what comes next. I enjoy that part of this app. I also like how I can have a widget on my phone so I can see the content everytime I use it. I also like how there are multiple categories, you can create your own mix and there is an option for a lifetime payment rather than just paying monthly. Thank you for creating such a wonderful app."
4,Lykceb,"I love all the quotes and customization options. It's very inspiring to keep on my homescreen. Right now my only small complaint is that I chose ""mix theme"" for the widget but it doesn't change with the quotes, it only changes when I click into the app. It would be so much nicer if each time the quote changed, the theme changed with it.  Also to everyone who is upset about the price. It is free, you just have to click the x in the top corner when they prompt you for premium. It doesn't charge unless you sign up for the charge. Hope that helps! 🤗"
5,always think you're awesome,This app helps me to feel like I belong here before I got this app and felt like everybody hated me that my hair was ugly but now I feel like I think my hair is actually beautiful I think I’m beautiful I think everybody’s beautiful you should download it it helps you a lot. Always stay positive and always think you’re beautiful even if you don’t have this app say positive stuff even if you think you’re ugly you’re beautiful hope y’all stay awesome and always think you’re awesome 🥰🥰🥰
5,kallielovebug,"it knows exactly what to say, and when. it goes off at the right time. and it just keeps telling me things i need to hear, not all the time what i want to hear, but what i need to. i’ve always struggled with mental health issues and this app some how knows that? and like goes off exactly when i need it to? me and my friends have gotten it, and it helps all of us, and we all agreed that it must stalks us, we don’t get the same notifications either. who ever made this app, thank you."
5,JeffOfficial,"Very good app that definitely enhances my mood/motivation. Worth the subscription (literally pay a buck each month or a 30 dollar one time payment). Here’s my issue with this app, you’ll start realizing the quotes you’ve already read continue to show up, but even in different categories. I guess it makes sense for this to occur if certain quotes fit in similar categories.. I hope the developer updates this app regularly with more new quotes so I’m not used to seeing the same old ones."
5,Gbabysly,"I have an app called “I Am” for daily affirmations that was created by the same people and had promoted this motivation app. I swear, receiving notifications from this app throughout each day, has helped pushed me to be the best version of myself. It’s helped me stay positive, get out of negative thought cycles, and remember who I am and the strength I have within. I get excited every time a notification pops up and to read what wise words it has for me. Highly, highly recommend !!!"
5,Jean Kamga,"As someone who is going to a magnet school next year, I though I had to be smart and my friends who applied and also made it were very smart. And called me dumb since I didn’t know core things everyone else did. Do my poor memory before middle school I couldn’t remember most things. But anyway this app give really good motivation quotes and quotes that help me think more positive about myself and to reach my goals. I really hope someone else can relate to this."
5,Lillwhgwjwhistqa,"Hi! I would like to thank this app so much, if you are struggling with self love, stress, etc. this app is a HUGE help! Some people might think quotes aren’t the best help but this helped me get through my break up and family issues. This showed me worthy of myself, so thank you very much! These quotes send whenever you like and tell you how important you are, how you should take little steps at a time, etc. Again, if you are struggling this app is a comfort. Thank you for reading. 5/5 stars😁❤️"
3,Pk567,"When I first started using the app, there was a lot more content for free. Now, most of the content is accessible only through a paid subscription. The review of three stars is based off of the changes made from free Content to paid Content. I have removed the app and will be looking for something that has access to some free content. I am happy to go through advertisements; I don’t expect to get something for nothing. I am not willing to add yet another subscription to my life. Tv, radio, and so much more have already gouged consumers with the subscription market."
5,black.with.slack,Is you’re going through a hard time in your life or struggling with a relationship or etc. This app helps a lot to just encourage you to keep going. The app also makes you think about the good things you have in your life. If you’re struggling with thinking on the positive side then this is the right app for you! If you’re struggling with a relationship problem or a family problem or friend problem this app will help you be more confident with yourself!
5,XYZZYX.BLUED,"I really loved the quotes, initially. So I immediately decided to purchase and subscribe to the application. Later, I noticed that I need to open the application from time to time to enable to receive ‘daily quotes’. But most of the time, I dont have time to open the app. I simply enjoy reading the quotes in my Notifications. By the way, I put the settings of the app for me to receive 10x daily quotes. I hope the developers can look into it."
5,ohcji,I was falling into a deep depression and then I got this app and inspired me and sent me a very inspirational messages when I needed them the most. I would definitely recommend downloading this app. You can pick where it starts and ends throughout the day NHS very inspirational for me and after I got this app. I fell out of my depression and so help me up today I was suffering from friend loss. And feel from hit me right to the heart I love this app and I definitely recommend downloading it please consider downloading it thank you.
5,alozzy1213,"This app really helps me stay positive. I’m currently in the process of helping myself mentally, physically, spiritually, financially, emotionally and all the while I’m struggling daily and failing often. I’m reminded with these simple mantras, quotes, sayings and writings that life can be whatever we want. Like the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes rapped on “Waterdalls”: “Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true. Believe in yourself. The rest is up to me and you.” I am choosing to focus on myself and your app makes each day going forward a bit brighter. Thank you immensely."
5,ᏢᏆNᎬᎪᏢᏢᏞᎬ,This app is amazing! In the past I had a lot of people say mean things to me like that I was ugly and that I was dumb and I didn’t mean anything and that I shouldn’t even be here... it really hurt me and made me want to cry everyday. It was like everyone hated me. But after I got this amazing app... it helped everything! Now I feel amazing and it is all because of this awesome app!!! Thank you so much for making this app for people who are experiencing the same things as I did! Thank you so so much!!!! I can’t even say how happy I am!! Thank you!
4,high-tech motivated,"This app really helps you on what you are striving in life and helps you think about all of the good things in life. I love it so much, but there’s one thing. It costs money to get all of this great and awesome work of art! Other than that, if you feel like paying money for it, then do it , but I just don’t recommend this app if you don’t want to pay for something that you might not even use. And they’re not even quoted motivations anyway. Lease buy it if you can. - an unreallated customer of this “motivation” app.-       Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
4,Hays67,"Love the motivating quotes and ability to customize categories! I especially love when a quote pops up on my Apple Watch and makes me smile 😊 Two big recommendations though — I like to save and share the images and happy to credit Meditation App, BUT.... 1. The Instagram integration is pretty useless because the images aren’t in square format so the quotes get cut off. And 2. Often I love the image, but hate the font. Or I love the quote, but can’t find an image that I like. Adding the ability to change the font and/or add your own image would make this 5 stars."
5,morgyCan,"This app has helped me through days I feel alone and feel like giving up. I have the notifications turned on and it sends me motivational quotes 100% relevant to my life. Quotes that relate to not giving up, reminding me that’s it ok not to be ok but not to look back. Because it’s only going to get better! I’ve actually never been so excited to write a review for an app until I downloaded this one. I’m on week 3 with this blessing! And I’m never looking back! ❤️"
4,Mainz event,"Sometimes you see too many quotes from the same people even if I change settings. Somehow the algorithm has sent me a ton of Michelle Obama and Billie Eilish. These women are not even in the same league. I definitely value the opinion and quotes from the First Lady over a relatively new pop star. Not saying that eilish can’t have good quotes but she didn’t necessarily transform the industry or genre.  If you go pop, go with credibility, maybe Madonna, Cher, Bono, Beyoncé or others that are icons. Single named stars are probably a good hint of at least have history."
5,Michael Ndudim,"I paid for the premium feature of this app excitedly, expecting it would allow me all the features of a great quote widget. I was sadly disappointed. I AM NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP NOR AM I LOOKING FOR LOVE AT THE MOMENT. Yet this app, no matter what presences I choose always seems to tailor me quotes that I have no interest in. You need to fix this. I set my quotes to specifically the “hustling” category for example and I’m getting quotes like “Be careful of who you put your trust and emotions in.” and I’m like c’mon - How does that apply to hustling."
5,GabbiesworlD,This app gets me through my day.. Without this positive and inspirational app I’d be way more negative in my daily life. This app reminds me that to have a rainbow it’s gonna but a little bit of rainy clouds before we get to be able to peak past the dark clouds and rainfall to see the amazing picture behind it all. Don’t ever forget that you too can create something that seems ugly and dark into colors and happy vibes. Don’t turn away before your beautiful rainbow gets to show its way of transcending vibrant colors!! 💆🏽‍♀️ BE HAPPY 😊
5,Music.Consumer.Critic.,"At first I thought this app was going to be generic or not helpful, but WOW! I lost my best friend, I’m losing my job in a couple months, so I thought why not try this app. It’s like the app knows what I’m going through or feeling in the moment. I’ll be upset or feeling my anxiety building and I’ll get a notification that “Everything will be ok.” It doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re so down, it’s the motivational boost I never knew I needed. And averaging $1.67 a month.. you can’t beat that."
5,tristenrl,I never write reviews but this app deserves one! You get to choose from so many different categories of what types of quotes you want to see. You can choose the background and font of the quotes. You can get scheduled push notifications if you want throughout the day of quotes. You can add quotes yourself and even change the app icon on your phone. I had to email them about a billing issue I had and they replied within minutes with exact directions on how to fix my problem. 10/10
4,AshLeyHBdawg,"Although it can get annoying sometimes with leaving the nonfiction's on when it sends a quote time from time, but most time it’s really helpful, I have anxiety, and somewhat dealing with depression, and so when I am over thinking or stressing about something the quotes just come in at the right time. And most time its what I am worrying about. it’s honestly so helpful I had plenty of quotes apps but this is honestly the best one. I don’t like the whole premium type thing and I personally don’t have it. But other then that it’s really good :,) and it’s helped me a lot."
5,itzjelly,This app has helped me become more of an understanding person and I would definitely recommend. With each quote it makes me view things in life a little bit differently. It truly has opened my eyes. It not only relaxes me but helps me from any stress I have. Seeing a quote or two a day will definitely help my mental state or if I’m just Struggling with the troubles of life. It makes me more appreciative of what I have and just overall just really change peoples aspects. 10/10 would recommend.
5,B0b L0Blaw,"I love this app and bought the year subscription. It works just fine on my iPhone, but when I try to use on my IPad it wants me to pay again and buy another subscription. DOes it only work on one device?? I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing will work. I have the receipt from Apple store where I paid for a year subscription. How can i access this app from multiple devices?"
5,Ecahua97,"Saw the app on my instagram feed, don’t usually download them but my gut told me to get this one. And honestly after the first day of the 3 day trial I was sold. I love that EVERYTIME I look at my phone now, there is a motivational or inspirational quote now. Causing me to think twice before unlocking my phone. If I could give it more than 5 I would. I don’t pay a single dollar for apps, but this one is 100% worth it. Thank you motivational app team!"
5,Limitless*,"I have just found this beautiful resource, at the most critical point in my life!  If you already know the basics of what you need to do, yet you crave that magical ingredient of inspiration for motivation in your life on a daily basis on all types of topics, I highly recommend that you try this app to your iPhone. It will not only inspire you, you will find yourself digging deeper and helping others finding resources deep within yourself. It truly is magically motivating!"
5,great confidence,"I was dealing with my parents devorcing and dealing with losing my sister and barley seeing her but this app brung me out and just really helped me become a better version of me it helped me through all the rough times and it made sure I stay positive so thank you so much for making a app like this, it’s a great app to exspress how u feel and gives u a little time to your self and gives u time to think of all the ways u could heal yourself"
5,Inaeri,"I was in a dark place. I had hit the end of the rope I felt like I had no reason holding onto.   Through this app and the submissions and quotes from real people, I found inspiration. I realized that all these things were being told to me in life from different sources, the people I love. I allowed myself to be present to the idea that I am loved and that I can control my life in any aspect. Having a healthy mind in order to pursue what inspires me.   Thank you!"
5,Bri.ski,"This app is definitely worth downloading. You can personalize everything, including how many notifications, if any, you get per day, colors and fonts of the content, physical appearance of the app, and more. Motivation has actually been so helpful for me with my mental health. It has really made me feel better sometimes and having a widget of it on my home screen gives me great reminders. Definitely would recommend this app to anyone!"
5,Fantasygirl115,So I checked this app out and I thought at first it wouldn’t be that good. But then I checked it out while I was stressing and crying and it calmed me down immediately. I’m so thankful for this wonderful app and I’m so happy I checked it out. Although one thing that annoys me is that you have to watch an app for a new style. I’m not telling you to fix that I’m just saying. I love this app and i look forward to reading it any other day! Keep up the good work! ❤️
5,Heartfotoediting,"I have an iPhone 11 and paid for the membership because I do struggle with anxiety, staying on task and self-esteem. These quotes are helpful on top of my therapy, but I’m waiting to see how the notifications work because I had to delete the app and re-download it in order for the notifications to supposedly work. Will find out in the morning if they worked or not. Motivation isn’t appearing on my iPhone’s Notifications category of Settings."
5,winkenhower,"This app has truly helped me stay motivated and focused on achieving my goals while keeping up with it. Not to mention I’ve been a lot more productive with my day. I have not felt so complete with an app before, as soon as I wake up or right before I go to bed I’m greeted with a motivational quote or just a statement least to say it’s my favorite way to start and end my day. I will be using this app to my full advantage as it has helped me in so many aspects."
5,you beed this in your life,"This app has changed my life you need to get it everyday I get 20 new quotes sent to me to brighten my day up and I love it. It’s like this app knows what specific quote I need when I need it for example I was feeling very very sad and depressed about the fact that my school life wasn’t very organized and just then I got a quote that said “no matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, your still ahead of everyone who isn’t trying” and my mood went up immediately I love this app❤️❤️❤️"
5,OnMyDrizzy93,"I really enjoy the motivation app because it provides me with a dose of encouragement as I go about my daily life. I know some people may not be the motivational quote type, but for those who enjoy an encouraging word or two and people who actively want to better there lives—this app is for you. You can filter the quotes to tailor it towards your specific struggles, lifestyle, etc. You can also add your own quotes, share them with others, and create custom backdrops. Thanks for a great product!"
5,Lizzie 🐼🐨,"This app does exactly the title. Motivate. No matter any day, any time, I could be scrolling on my phone, unmotivated and bothered, lazy. But when motivation sends me a notification, usually along the lines of a cheerful ‘you got this’, I feel ready to conquer my day and start moving around. Why be on your electronics when you could be happy and motivated? This app had a very stress-free impact on me that I’ll never forget. Those hourly notifications keep me strong."
2,srhwww,"As a person who values factuality, proper credits, accurate quotes (not to mention spelling) this app has disappointed in many ways. What actually prompted me to come here and leave a review is the quote that just came up on my phone: ""Breath in deeply and slowly once in a while just to appreciate life."" Do they vet the quotes submitted?  'Breath' in deeply? So help me. There have been a lot of inaccurate and butchered quotes that are downright abhorrent. I give 2 stars because their concept is wonderful, app development decent and the promise for improvement is existent. I hope those who manage this app will see this review and take my feedback in earnest."
5,Starstruck cowgirl,"Love this app, has great quotes and can really help me smile. There is only one dislike I have and that’s become recent. Every time I close the app the open it back up, the background is back to black. So I change the background again, flip through some quotes, the close out. Never used to to have this problem and yes I have paid for a subscription a couple years in a row. If this could be fixed, I’d give 5 stars. Great app though."
4,the1out2line,"I personally find this app very helpful, I struggle with anxiety + depression so this is very useful. I love the letting go quotes because I have a hard time doing exactly that. If you are reading this please please get the app, if you struggle with hard things like breakups, friendships, family’s, ext.. then you need this. The only thing I don’t like is that for quotes for cheating ext.. you have to get premium, why do people have to pay for their mental health to get better, just make it free that’s all I really want, that’s why I gave you 4 stars."
5,baddieee 💋,I’m not sure if anyone else can relate but every time going threw something or something negative is on my mind I’ll have a “ pop up “ come on my phone with a quote that is so inspirational an has so much to do with what I’m thinking or feeling at the moment. Idk it just knows when to say the right things at the right time. Smh wish I could find a partner that new what to say and when to say it like this app and we wouldn’t have this issue 🤣
5,Still on the wheel,I don’t have much experience with apps. Most of the ones I buy “do”something for me. This one is just a fun app that gives me a brief something to think about. I was enjoying a quote and I stepped away and came back and it was gone and all the features are pay to play. Except themes. I am the quote master for my BNI group but I know there are several quote databases. How can I afford to buy yours and perhaps another. I guess I don’t have enough faith that this is the only site I want to go all in.
4,wkeving,"I really do live this app. The quotes are fresh, the design options are many, the new widgets are awesome. The only issue I have, which I reported to the developer a while back, is the lack of true WYSIWYG in the theme editor. I can select a font and a size and have it look perfect only to save it and then see it differently with the line breaks being changed and sometimes leaving a single word on a line. Once that’s fixed, and maybe after I have more control over for sizing in general, I’ll give this 5-stars easily."
5,Quote2me,I’m glad that I decided to check out this app. Throughout the day it sends you motivational quotes or affirmations that you can reflect on. I started sending them to my friends and one of them ended up checking out the app. The only downside is that you have to pay for it if you don’t want to have to watch ads. But at least it gives you the chance to try it out before purchasing.
5,EffecientAgileBeast,"To each of you who read this…Peace unto you now and always…ALL ways.  This app has quickly become a significant part of my day. As I face life with new job acquaintances; No friends, No family what-so-ever! I found myself struggling at moments to dig deep enough to create self encouragement.  This is a particularly challenging time and THIS APP HAS/IS A TRUE BLESSING. Thank you, wishing y’all positivity & peace 🕊️  P.S. NO I’m not just out of prison; my family & friends were ripped from my life in a horrible atrocity."
5,Ladyvee103,"Daily I am amazed with so many posts coming that truly align with my devotion daily. We ask for affirmations and do not look for them.  Religious or not it is hard to be negative when you read these.  I hope these help you to feel better and see the positive things in our world.  Oh yeah you can choose the category, the background and how frequently these arrive.  Enjoy and spread a little positivity in your piece of the world"
5,panthergirl 0900,"OMG I cannot even start with how much I love this app! I use this app to write notes for my mom who works third shift and takes care of a kindergartner and seventh grader all day because of the pandemic and I cannot get enough of it after lookin up "" inspirational quotes"" online so much it's almost impossible to find any good ones that I haven't use but this app is kind of like the TikTok of quotes everything is new and it's kinda addicting once you get into it. Anyway yeah great app live it definitely recommend 😁❤️💖"
5,Linda 1967,This app makes me realize that no matter how painful things turn out to be or experienced there’s always something to be grateful for in life never give up just because others hurt you in the past you love learned and move forward always with love in your heart being humble and kind to others even though sometimes people are not perfect love and accept their imperfections it’s part of being human ;)
1,Parker Lewis never loses,"Was excited to try, ended up deleting after 3 days — maybe I had an unlucky streak?   There’s hundreds of phrases that are more motivating, positive, true and constructive than the 3 I was served in my first few consecutive days. Why not put those out into the world and in front of the beautiful people instead of this.   There’s a lot of great small quotes and phrases in stoicism, on yogi tea bags, etc. why not use stuff like that?   The final one that got me was: “if people treat you like they don’t care about you, believe them” like — woaaahhh okay, cool dude. Sure, if I have -15 self respect score maaaaaybe that’s helpful in turning on the lights so to speak but then what i’m supposed to be motivated to stand up for myself by basically being mad at them? This is the shallowest, cheapest form of motivation. You got this! Let’s up the quality bar a bit with content that’s already around and available elsewhere and put beautiful thoughtful things on a plate for folks! That would be so incredible! Inspire!"
2,JSM031315,"***please fix the issue so that “do more of what makes you happy” is not the only quote I see 99% of the time!!!***   I pay for the app and have been in love with it from the start, but I recently noticed that the widget on my home screen shows the same quote and never changes. If I click in to the app I can scroll through and change the widget to the quote I closed the app on, but then it just goes back to the same one it was showing before when it rotates. Previously, I was seeing new quotes several times per day. Not sure what happened but it’s a bit frustrating."
4,Fluffy2lite,"I just finished setting up my preferences in the app…. AFTER I had to agree to the 3-day trial then a set payment for monthly or yearly. I was really hoping not to pay for quotes that I could get online. However, I love the random quotes that come across my Apple watch and lock screen on my iPhone.  I gave it 4 stars simply due to pure disappointment. Can't we have a FREE version with limited quotes or options? Otherwise, thank you for a great app and the ability to send me positive quotes all day long!"
3,DakotaTotes,As I said. I used to have this app but unfortunately deleted it because I needed the space. I love how personalized it is and I ADORE the fact you can pick the app logo but you used to be able to do more. And unfortunately I can’t sign back into my old account simply because I don’t see an option to. You used to pick the font and background with more freedom but I do recommend this app. It isn’t right in your face like others are. It just provides simple reminders that you got this.
4,arteach101,"I like this app, but I have a few suggestions. I believe the widgets need to be more accessible. You can only change the font. I have a hard time reading the widgets because of the photo on my lock screen. It would be nice to be able to add a slightly transparent background behind the words so you can read them better. Kind of like subtitles. I’m not sure if this is possible with Apple’s weird system, so I won’t fault the developers too much"
5,kjb357,"I really appreciate these motivations several times a day, they pop up and I read everyone of them, I’m not sure how long how long I’ve been reading them but I feel like they are helping me like myself, they make me think and make me aware of how unhappy I am in my life. It’s up to me to make me happy. Thank you so much for this app! I will update how my mental health is in a couple months, it can only get better. I do highly recommend❤️"
5,Eden-Adaire!,"I’ve been dealing with letting go of my ex, we would’ve made two years this December and I just really miss him because I was the one who hurt him so much to push him away. I’ve dealt with other issues like not being treated right by my current boyfriend. Hah, I guess that’s karma. I had a bad childhood too and I get so stressed out from my current boyfriend and flashbacks. These quotes really help me. They’re so creative and they really left a dent in my heart. Thank you."
5,gubftvvfbb,I love this app because it really does have a whole bunch of good quotes with different categories so it’s really easy to find stuff that relates to you and I love how it sends you some every day and I also love that feature where you can just ask Siri to like motivate you or whatever and she gives you a good quote I just love that feature so much and I think you should keep making apps that are as useful and as inspiring as this one
5,ragdoll.dancer,I adore the motivation app. I feel like it knows what I’m feeling or knows what i’m going through then gives me the right quote to think about during that time. I love waking up every morning to a new inspiring quote to think about for the day and going to bed thinking about how i could make a difference in life tomorrow. It’s one of my favorite ways to get my day started. I have tons of liked quotes saved on the app. It really is my motivation.
5,ft HD channels,"I love this app. I enjoy seeing quotes daily for motivation when I am sad. However I watch ads to change the background often, but after I change it I cant use ones I previously unlocked. I gets rather annoying when I have to watch another video to unlock a background that I used two weeks ago. And no, I am not paying money for the app no matter how cheap it is. So while I love this app it’s not always so great."
4,Lafilegiselle,"Would it be possible for you to offer a lifetime option? I think considering the costs that go into creating the app and paying everyone involved it’s more than fair to request payment for Premium services. However that being said, I’d be a lot quicker to purchase the premium services if I only had to pay for them once - I rather not pay for them annually. That’s just my two cents. Otherwise I love this app and reading the quotes always helps brighten up my day, thank you for developing this!"
1,michelleeee88,"Used to love this app and recommended it frequently to others, but now it’s so hard to use because of the constant ad pop ups. With each ad, you have to wait for the full video to play before exiting out (which is common, but after so many ads you basically spend more time on the ads then reading quotes).   I used to open the app to read through the quotes to like / dislike them. I believe there’s an algorithm, so if you like / dislike quotes, the app adapts to your taste.  However, there are just so many ads that I hate wasting my time opening it, and now all the quotes that pop up in my notifications are not applicable to me whatsoever. In fact, I really dislike the quotes I’m seeing.   Completely understand it’s all about your taste / preferences, but I can’t even open the app to like the quotes that are more my taste because of all the ads that pop up!   I get they’re trying to encourage us to subscribe, which again, I understand, but the free app version is not usable because of all the ads."
5,LS0295,I got this app because I needed motivation. I wasn’t sure how good the app was gonna be until I got it. It is the best app that I have gotten. It motivates me to do thing that I haven’t and to do better in life and for my self. It motivates me everyday. I love how you can pick your background and set times to get notifications. It’s really helpful. My only thing that I dislike is how the premium is so expensive I wish it was only like $20 or free. Other then that I love this app. I highly suggest getting it!
5,megan•^•,"This app has helped me get through so many hard times. From little things like stressful work to big things like my depression. The notification always seemed to pop up at the perfect time whenever I needed a reminder of my worth.  And I’m saying this with honesty, there is nothing about this app I would change ❤️. I recommend this app if you are struggling with anything. Words are powerful. They can boost your mood so quickly and remind you who you are. 5 stars."
5,Veritru,This app has made me feel so much more confident since day one god bless the creators of this app because it has made me stop crying over little things it has made me appreciate more and it has brought me somewhere I never knew I could go so thank you so much and Ik people can get frustrated over ads but I really don’t care as much as I did before because of this app they really did their best on this app
2,Nancy16,"I have downloaded and used this app for while since someone told me for motivation on my journey. I found out there so many negative, self sabotage, threatening, deadly messages along with good messages. Some morning I have got up with messages which is no negative , demotivating which you don’t want to see in the morning. Message about death , harmful messages someone trying use this app to emotionally abuse through this app messages. I will not recommend as motivation app as there is lot of negativity, emotional energy, emotional distress messages involved sometimes. Will be deleting the app soon ."
5,Chesonis,"At first, I found it very difficult to figure out how to get this to function using the quotes that I added, and have them (and only them), to display as the “reminder” pop-up’s, and to ONLY display MY added quotes on the Lock Screen, and also in a widget.   Fortunately, I was able to figure it out, and absolutely love this app. I would highly recommend it and give it a five star rating. It’s worth every penny."
5,Biscuits McV,"When trouble comes at me head on, this apps positive and motivating quotes and advice give me a moment to reflect, re-evaluate and encourage me and the people around me. User friendly, extremely helpful & the free version isn’t weighed down with ads. Top notch. My only complaint is the simple plain background. These should be memes. And I would love to work for you all turning all these awesome positive vibes into superb memes with super neat backgrounds. I am a Meme Wizard, after all."
3,Plant mom,"I love this app and the little boosts it gives me throughout the day! However the longer quotes are impossible to read on an Apple Watch. The quotes just end with … but I cannot scroll to read the rest. ☹️ I’ve looked into the settings on both the Watch and my phone to adjust this and found nothing. I’d love it if I could either use the dial on the Watch to scroll down to read the whole quote, or just use my finger to pull the screen up. If someone knows of a way to do this, I will adjust my review."
5,Gio Israel,Great app love it! Seems like the quotes I get daily have some kind of connection to what is going on in my life at the moment and definitely helps reading all the positivity. Only thing that sorta bugs me is when I receive the notification on my Lock Screen sometimes the quotes are to long and I’m unable to finish reading the quote then when I click on it to open the app it shows me an entirely different quote..but other than that really do love this app.
5,💯👍🏾❤️,"So far I really like this app. I really feel like from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep that this app is going to make me feel better about myself and feel better about life and the reason that I am here. I really recommend people to get this app if they have low self-esteem, or if they just need help getting through the day, hard times or just need the little boost in their life. this app is really the best of them yet. I really recommend people to try it out.  ❤️❤️"
5,famousaya12,To be honest this app has helped me over come many difficult things that I was going through and  things I was keeping deep in my heart it helped me through the process of healing and focusing on myself it made me care less for the things that are breaking me down day by day every quote that pops up my phone gives me motivation to move forward and learn from my mistakes and be a better person of myself.
5,Moni236,"I usually don’t feel inclined to leave reviews on apps. But I downloaded this app on a whim, and I can say that it may be the best app of its kind. I’m convinced that it’s listening to the troubles I’m having, and sends quotes based on that.   Never did I expect to see this app pop up in my notifications with a simple “take a breath, it’s going to be okay” when I was in the middle of a full blown mental break. Both free and premium are great. Get the app."
5,XxkylieXx🙂,"I think the app is something really good to use because if you think about committing suicide then you could get this app and it will give you so many quotes it’s great but for anyone reading this or still is thank you and please don’t think about committing suicide because someone out there loves you and would hate to see you do that stuff so please don’t! Be happy love your selfie, appreciate who you are and the most saying is BE YOURSELF!!! Hope this changes your day."
5,MB3LLS,"Many people may complain about seeing quotes they’ve already seen elsewhere, but I honestly don’t even mind. Yes, I’ve seen many of the quotes before, but it sure doesn’t matter to me. Feels nice when I am in need of some motivation to get through my day, and I happen to receive a notification that hits right in the heart to keep me going. We should all just appreciate the idea of this app, along with its creator of it. It’s the littlest things that matter."
5,annomyus5,"i love this app because i can access these quotes, affirmations, motivations anywhere: my phone, my iPod, my watch, my iPad and even my MacBook. when i heart a quote i like, my feed gives me more of that style of quotes or affirmation. the only thing i don't like is the categories you need to buy. it should be free because self motivation is priceless. if you are reading this, thinking you should get it, listen to my advice and get it!!"
5,Dpozone,I’m currently going through a divorce and it’s been a challenging time in my life. I didn’t realize how much this app would help me. It seems to send me what I need when I need it. I usually don’t pay for apps but I don’t mind paying for this one. I shared it with a friend who is going through the same thing and it became a nice bonding point for us. We send quotes from this app back and forth.
4,DeAntonette,This app is great and does have really good quotes to keep your mind at peace and to just be more positive in general BUT I do wish I can go back and look at all the quotes that was sent to me on that specific day or even previous day's if possible. I sometimes see the quotes on my Apple Watch and then dismiss them but I would normally have to take a screenshot to save them or remember them and also from the watch you can't see the whole quote so I would love it if there is a way to go back and see exactly what quotes were sent to you.
2,iRichard B.,"This app has potential, sadly it lacks versatility by only allowing to choose one “curated topic” of quotes sent as notifications. There is no option to receive variety of quotes sent by notification unless you chose the “general” option & those quotes are a hit or miss & are not really curated for me personally. You are not allowed to chose multiple topics at a time. I paid for the premium & expected to be able to edit this feature to my liking. Therefore, I would not recommend to pay for the subscription premium. Other than that the app is fine but limited if premium is not purchased."
5,Meglodon7777777,"This apps isn’t anything special BUT small things can really make a difference. Getting threw my day with a positive mindset has always been hard for me. But this app just makes it a little easier. Going about my day getting these small quotes on my phone just overall make me a happier person. They are inspiring, honest, and motivating. I definitely recommend this app if you are looking to become a happier and more motivated person."
5,bobb_3,"This app rocks! honestly, i don’t know if it the app making me happier or thing going on in my life. but i do know that my entire mindset has changed, and i have become more proud of myself. i feel really good right now, and even though there are a lot of really sucky things happening in my life right now, i know that this app is still helping me every day with reminders that i am not alone. it’s a really helpful app that i recommend to anyone who likes inspiring things."
5,Tj13515,"It may seem silly but this app is literally saving my life. Yes, some of the quotes are things you have heard a hundred times but sometimes you need to hear them a hundred and one times. I have been spiraling very easily due to CPTSD. I have the app set to send me quotes every 30 minutes. So many times a quote that I really need to hear at that moment comes up and pulls me up out of the quick sand whirlpool sucking me down. When I say this app is literally saving my life life... I mean literally!!!"
5,Cr@z! V33,So I purchased the lifetime. Subscription and yes probably shouldn't have  When u try to redeem previous purchase the bundle I bought is not the same or available so my lifetime is no more?    On my new phone its running ads and the lifetime is no more!!!!  It's already embarrassing enough to have spent this money on this but what's worse is to have the cash out and no ability to add now.  (havejt contacted support yet but honestly don't have time for that right now )
4,zxwjfofnr,"Motivation helps you see a different perspective than you may be are seeing your difficult trail in life as. That different perspective I’ll just say shows how the bad Apple wasn’t only just bad but by the surroundings that made it that way. So in life we are going to be surrounded by choices and people of all kind. If we want to be the good Apple picked from the apple tree we need to say no, figure out the right choice, know what will motivate us or yourself to become the best of you. A good Apple. 🍎 a -Kaylie Shumway"
5,The Tacocat,"This app is supposed to be very relaxing and motivating, hence the name, but I do not find it relaxing or motivating at all. The ads that keep popping up are very annoying and stress me out even more. ALL I WANNA DO IS READ MY QUOTES 😫 No, but in reality this is a very good app and I recommend it to a few of my friends, most of whom have downloaded the app purely for the quotes and aesthetic backgrounds. It really is relaxing, and makes me feel better about myself. ♥️"
5,Smiffleblurf,The latest iOS update broke widget functionality and the only way to apparently fix it is to uninstall the app and lose all your favorites. Love love this app but there should be a better way for us to save her favorites and not lose them in case situations like this happen with iOS updates such as saving our favorites to iCloud or sync to the server these motivations are pulling from.
5,123446677888543246,"Omg I absolutely love this app I was having a rough day I was stressed and couldn’t stop thinking about how stressed I was but when I saw this app I was like wow maybe I should give it a try let me tell you that was the best decision I’ve made in a while. When it was done downloading I set it up and when I read the quotes it made my day so much better it made me happy,happy enough that I am writing this review I highly recommend this app thank you so much to whoever made this app it’s amazing."
5,emilymstineba,"This app is so amazing!! My stepmom used to send me quotes every morning but she stopped because she got very busy, this has replaced her unfortunately but is still giving me motivation. You can even change the icon on your phone and this is the only app I’ve seen that can do that!! It’s absolutely amazing!! Even though I don’t have premium I do just fine without it, however I imagine it’d be even more fantastic with it!! I really recommend this fabulous app!!"
5,TonyS0322,This app is great so far and I hope to keep using it! Most of the time I sit in my room crying about life but I think I could be more open and try to loosen up! I normally never write reviews but when just the 2nd day using I and seeing a difference in my personality I thought to write a review I think anyone and everyone should download this app. Never hurt to try right? Actual never mind but this won’t hurt to try at least.           Thank you - A difference
5,ixsaa,I love this app. It gives me quotes everyday that sometimes it gives me quotes I need to hear. However I wish all of the different categories would just unlock. And sometimes it gives me the same quotes. But the thing I like most about it is that they give you real quotes. Like quotes you don’t wanna hear but need to hear. I also like how you can create your own quotes. I wish that we didn’t need to watch an ad for every theme to unlock. But so far I love this app!
5,Mdsnowy,Sometimes I think that this App has psychic abilities. I think that it knows what I am currently experiencing. I will be going through circumstances and open my phone and the exact words I need to hear are right there for me to see! This app has been my friend when nobody else has been there! It has motivated me to overcome the very things that should have destroyed me!!! Thank you Motivation App
5,criminal affensive side-eye,"I just started using this app, and I already love it. I really needed this app after I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me with my best friend, and broke up with me, just to say “I don’t like Montana”. I’m still in school and have a lot of missing work, and I also don’t really know who are my real friends and who aren’t. So I really need this, and a nice quote, a boost of confidence, or motivation is really helpful sometimes."
5,Gtadustin,"Life is Hard, Life isn’t Easy, Not Always are we all able too remain Positive threw out Life’s challenging experiences, Though when a person you don’t know holds the door at a Business establishment for you, it creates a chain reaction of positivity of you & others holding the door for others. Just like this app “One Motivational quote”, Can create a positive mindset or chain reaction all on how you apply it to your day."
5,kids14mom,So I’ve had this app for a while and i’m in love with it! I love how many beautiful messages it has and the background customization is perfect! It’s great to have as a widget on my screen to look at when opening my phone or to scroll through in the mornings to put me in a good mood. Honestly this app is 100% worth downloading and I have no complaints! I'm so happy to have downloaded it!! :D  Thank you!!! <3
5,CindyB13,I downloaded this app while I was trying to break a bad habit. I knew it would be a tough couple weeks so I set this for hourly motivations during my daylight hours. I don’t think I would have accomplished my goal without this app. Thank you. You changed my life. The constant reminders brought my focus back in line. I’m keeping the app and setting for a couple daily quotes. Highly recommend.
2,Erykah A,"I used to really enjoy this app and use it for daily motivation. I fell off for a bit and now I've come back to it and I see that the app has changed and pretty much everything is locked and only available with a premium account. Pretty disappointed I can't use it like a used to. It's annoying seeing all the categories but knowing I can't access them unless I pay. Great marketing tactic, I get it, but because I know what this app used to be, I don't like this new money seeking approach. Thanks for the great quotes up until now but I'll just stick to googling the quotes I want, that's still free."
5,manda_ninja_panda,"I love this app iv been using it for a couple years. whenever I need to be reminded that even the toughest times will pass. Or when I need to remember it’s ok not to be perfect. I pull up the app when i need to be reminded that making mistakes is good, so as long as you learn and grow when you make them. I could go on and on about how helpful this app is but I’m going to stop before I ramble on more then I already have."
5,"Good Samiratan #7,642,874","I don’t write many reviews, I’m a serial decliner of any kind of questionnaire or survey asking me about products etc, it’s really a bad habit.   However, I give the Motivation app a 10/10, five stars, high five, whatever. It’s hands down the best thing I’ve done for myself and I hope it helps you too, might seem or sound gimmicky, but the old adage, “you are what you eat” relates to the mind too."
1,IkeMoss,"For some reason the app doesn’t allow you to listen to your music on full volume when you’re using the app. I do fitness training every day so I post daily quotes on my social media which I try to get most of them from this app. I’m up at 4 AM getting the gym ready and listening to music trying to be pumped up but while I’m looking for my quotes, my music volume is turn down all the way or cut off completely. I’ll get off the app, play my music, get back on the app and the app shuts my music down again m. Why is a Motivation app that gives us quotes regulating my music volume? Makes me hate the app"
5,"Me,the🏐","I am absolutely obsessed with this app. It gives you motivation quotes throughout the day. They are catered to what you need to hear and I love it. My only problem is paying for the app, I don’t have the resources to spend on pay for no ads. But it’s just as useful even when you don’t pay. I recommend this to anyone who needs to be reminded of their worth, especially after a break up!"
3,Kandy Kid Saturn,"First, I LOVE this app.  I’ve been using it for over a year.  I share the quotes with my husband and children, I use the quotes for writing prompts for my students.  It is a *great app!*  Just a hiccup, and I see I’m not the only one with this issue reading other reviews, the widget is not working since the latest updates.  I’ve deleted and reinstalled three times even.  Turning off my phone and back on.  The whole 9 yards.  All the widget screen says is “Tap here to refresh widget.”  Any assistance would be appreciated :)"
4,Petyuwushhshs,"I saw this app online when it was shared through social media. Overall, this is a good app and I like the daily reminders but I can’t see any of the past quotes. For example, I saw a quote today that I really enjoyed that popped up as a reminder and I cannot find it anywhere in the app. I think a calendar listing the day of the week and the quote that was used as a reminder in the lock screen would be a good idea. Wish I could even remember the quote since it was so applicable to my life and had good inspiration!"
4,CowLover506,I love this app super easy offers a three day trial but you can click the x and move on it takes you through all of it to asking what you struggle with most to what your name is to include it in the quotes it even tells you how to add the widget and lets you customize the app look and what behind the quotes look like I love this app so far I told the rest of my family to download this app just because we all have our ups and downs
5,smc R20,"This app is so on point and accurate!! Every time (and I do mean EVERY TIME) I have some thought in my head or I begin taking about something, I get a quote on my Apple Watch ⌚️or I unlock my phone and see a quote on my widget and it speaks DIRECTLY to me about whatever it is that’s on my mind/heart. I appreciate this app so much because it most definitely helps me when in need. You’d be amazed on how helpful this app is!!! Thank you guys!!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽"
5,cboccadoro,This app is actually super amazing. And you don’t need to pay for it to get what you need out of it. I have recommended this app to so many people that I’ve lost track and ALL of them have thanked me for it. Being able to set those automatic quotes is AWESOME. And I might sound silly but sometimes getting one of those quote notifications can literally help me reflect and push past rough moments. I know it’s helped a lot of the people I’ve recommended it to.
5,janiem325,"I like the app but I think you need to make sure the quotes are correct before printing.  I tried to cut and paste the quote to show you but it wouldn’t work.  The quote is in the catagory of DREAM BIG it is by Kristi Bowman. I believe the last word of the quote should be SOAR not SOUR,lol. Not a very inspiring quote if one may “sour”. Just thought since you are in the business of inspiring through words you may want to make sure you are using the correct words. ;-D"
5,dreamer2487,I like this app a lot but the only downside to this is that every thing is locked and you can’t get anything without having to spend thirty dollars 💵 on unlocking everything and there’s so many adds non stop but it’s still a really great app and if you’re thinking about getting this app you might want to get it on valentines or close to a holiday because there are deals like unlocking the entire thing for five bucks really cheap 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵
5,XxDareBarexX,I’ve had this app for years and I’ve had it set to send me quotes every so often every day. Most of the time I ignore the quotes because they just get lost to all my other notifications.. but sometimes I get sent one that just HITS! It’s the right quote at the right time and it just makes my day. I recommend this app to anyone who needs a little inspiration in their daily life. ✨
5,Bestchickever,"i’m obsessed with the option to set two different quotes (that change many times a day and you can choose the topics of EACH) as widgets on your lock screen with ios 16. i know its $20 a year but frankly these quotes make me happy many times a day and I find that is worth it. if you do the math, $20 a year isn’t bad for constant smiles / reminders. i’m all for it & im glad it works on the lock screen."
5,⭐️lyssa,"this app comes with so many good sayings that i wish i would’ve known sooner. they teach you things and open your perspective up in a really good way. it makes me look at things differently currently as well. the widget is really nice for your lock screen with the new iOS 16 update, and i really like how it completes my wallpaper. overall, i really love this app! i’ve already recommended it to my friends."
5,karebare2771,"Love this app so much, connected to my Apple Watch it never fails to make me smile.. today I didn’t want to workout and felt very discouraged.. opened the app to see a message of “keep getting up, keep working, keep fighting for what you want” and I needed to see/hear That exact message... completed the workout and feeling good thank you for creating this app❤️stay motivated everyone!"
4,MBristol-MCord,"I really like this widget and app. I’ve had it for quite a while now. But recently the widget isn’t loading, I click on the app and the same quote is still there days later and now I’m stuck to a black box going on a couple days now. I pay to use this app, please get it fixed, I really like it. I really don’t want to delete it and cancel the subscription. But I gave it 4 stars because I’ve never had issues until just recently. :)"
5,D. Willliams,"Idk how to express my gratitude for the motivational quotes you guys send. I was really going through some dark times just a few days ago and man you guys helped lift me. Today as I’m sitting trying to put smile on and not be sad you guys sent out “no matter how you feel.. get up, dress up, show up and never give up. You can do this” I needed that more then you know and it’s been tough lately but you guys been giving me a little hope. So thank you."
4,apersonxox,"So, in summary, the app is fabulous!  The app shows quotes that can help people who are facing rough times and help them feel better. However, when I downloaded the app, I noticed that most of the topics were locked and were only able to be accessed by getting Premium. The Premium does cost a good amount of money, and I feel it should at least cost less, considering many people want to see the quotes and can help them."
4,LqBlurx,"Everything is good about the app I got it only for the widgets but it’s pretty good. The notifications though are terrible, not the quotes but the fact that it doesn’t show the full quote unless you click on it. I understand there is a max limit of words for notifications and that’s why I suggest you guys make it so only short quotes are in notifications so you can see them easier without it being long and having ... at the end so you can’t see the full quote."
2,Timplerun,Used to love this app as it would just be random positive notifications that would pop up on my phone throughout the day and nothing more. Now they have made the notifications appear but every quote will not be finished and will end with “.....” thus requiring you to open the app to see the quote and this is very upsetting as I loved the app when all it required was just a quick glance at the lock screen but nonetheless i will probably keep the app in hopes that they eventually change it back but this is definitely something i do not like and the reason i am giving it a 2star today.
4,Kimmi1210,"I absolutely LOVE this app! I look forward to getting alerts with quotes everyday! BUT & this is a big but... I don’t appreciate the fact that I am paying for this app and it stops working constantly... I’ll get the quote alerts for a couple of days & then it just stops... I have to go back into the app to resubmit the reminder function. If I wasn’t paying for this then that is a different story, but I am. This needs to be fixed immediately bc its extremely frustrating‼️"
5,Mimi Bryan,"Thank you for creating the words of wisdom sent my way.  Yes, there are some that have zero relevance to do with my life. There are many that are very helpful in various ways.  If I had been able to read some of the helpful with life quotes earlier in my life, there is no doubt that I would be in a different place today.   Congrats in helping so many people with your insights & coaching. ❤️"
5,AllPositive,"I absolutely enjoy the Motivation app!  I read them first thing in the morning and throughout my day!  I’ve found myself sharing many of them with my family and friends. Having all the various categories is ideal as you’re able to qualify and receive the motivation quotes that truly speak to you and the mood or mode you’re in.   Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
2,reeeēę,"I spent a lot of money on a year subscription worth of this app and then I realize after a couple months that there’s nothing I can do to unfreeze the widget that’s on my lock screen, which is the only reason why I wanted this app. It is stuck on the quote “Do more of what makes you happy.” no matter what I do. I can’t change it very rarely will it change but I have it set to change 8 to 12 times a day and 95% of the time it’s stuck on that quote, and the category that that quote is under I don’t even have selected in my choices of topics."
5,QueenB4507,"Im far from Mrs. Positivity ,, soo When i downloaded this app i didnt really expect myself to use it much but i find myself on the app multiple tines a day! I really like the widget & the daily notifications ill see throughout the day on my lock screen are decent. I like how u can watch a video to change the theme and your not forced to buy the premium version to use those features. All around 5 star app. Well deserved. 😇"
5,Mariah Nash,"I just now download this app and I started reading some of the quotes that can help me through life some of the quotes explain some things I have to work on I l like this app because it lets me believe in myself so that I can be strong and nomatter what I done have to change me you should really download this app .Be strong ,Don’t be scared and down load this app it will help you a lot now and in the future it’s great I hope you download it |             Love,Mariah M.Nash"
5,¡jewelz!,"I wish I could give 6 stars- this app deserves an extra “point”. I’ve never written a review for any app but this one, I had to, it’s truly that great. The quotes are profound and applicable to anyone no matter where they are in life. My favorite part is the reminders- several times through out my day, a quote will pop up, giving me words to help me get through whatever is happening in life, good or bad. I love love LOVE this app. And it’s free! How can u go wrong trying it?"
5,naushaee,"Hello without motivational app idk where I’d be! This app with these encouraging words have help me remove myself out of a toxic situation-ship that honestly never served me from the start, I was just settling for so long. Didn’t know my worth but this app helped me through other personal things as well! I will always have this app no matter what! Thank you TikTok for recommending this app through my feed! Big help!"
3,Rach8023,I love this app. I love that i can save and favorite my favorite quotes. But the prices for the subscription are ridiculous. I’m not paying that much money a month for an app to do the bare minimum of an app: send notifications to me. It’s very helpful during a frustrating day to look at my phone and see the motivational quote because it just reminds me of what i’m working for and my goals. But it’s ridiculous to pay that much for an app to send me notifications. Nope.
4,nicknane held me up😡,"So, I’m a premium user and have not scrolled through in a couple months. Whyyyyyyy am I getting ads now??? I just got THREE ads in 30 seconds and one of them was an ad for a free month of premium when I’m yearly. I usually pay for premium services to SKIP the ads!! This is rather annoying to keep having to tap the screen OR swipe out the app and come back in for an ad to be removed. I do NOT like this update at all!!!!"
3,Davidmay21,"The app has great quotes, it has a great reminding system. The problems I have with the app are only 2 things. One being the Lock Screen with IOS 16 doesn’t work like they say it does. It won’t pop up on the Lock Screen to add it as a widget. The Apple Watch says it’s not allowed on the face. Not sure what that is, but those are the only two problems I see. Other then that the app doesn’t close randomly it’s not slow. It runs smooth. Easy to navigate too."
5,Kfran09,I have been going through a hard battle of divorce at this time and the daily quotes this app sends me is always such great timing and most needed. Reading the motivation quotes and the powerful message it has behind them. You never know what such little positive words can do to a person and help push that person to keep carrying on. I love this app and it has kept me striving to “want” and “go” instead of lay around and stress and worry. Thank you guys!!
5,BigRaychell,"I can honestly say I love this application it’s so accurate & consistent I love the motivation it gives me and it’s always in the best moment , your brain definitely performs better when your being positive when your happy you in general just feel better about you about life. Thank you so much for this app! I wish I could 100 star it ! 😁"
5,#nonicknameneeded,"For awhile, this app wouldn’t give me the notifications it was supposed too. Recently, my life has gone down hill, and now, it sends one to me every day. I started waking up, and got scarily accurate quotes on how I’m feeling. Last night, I found out my dog passed from his sudden sickness, and I woke up this morning to “It may take time but things will get better.” It’s crazy… but I needed it and I love it."
5,Private2028,Thanks Apple for recommending this app. The days no longer start off energized and hopeful only to be warm down by 3pm by the many daily trials. I upped the amount of notifications so all day long as I read the messages I reset my perspective and focus. Most days now end with a mellow satisfaction and peaceful acceptance.  I get more done and spend less time on negative things that I can’t control.
5,Star Poulin,I’ve had this app for 10 minutes and it feels so nice to have encouragement” to make my day and week and month better when I don’t have that encouragement from people in my life. I highly recommend this app for anybody that is feeling alone people who don’t care in your life or even just want that little quote to make him feel a little bit better and their day. 💗😊
5,Leidy roque,I recommend this app to teens and adults because it helps me as a teen to pass threw a lot of hard parts. It makes me happy when sometimes there is no one out their to do that. One problem is premium. Premium limits your choices witch means it limits you on how you want to see things.  For example if you want to see a break up in a different perspective than being sad you can’t do that because it’s blocked.
4,JonesBonnie13,It’s really good but I just wish I could like help you with your anxiety actually or like me to depression or something like that instead of just like giving you these quotes you know that would be really useful and nice but of course it’s like what it says so get it if you want what it says because that’s what it says exactly perfectly the exact same but would be so great if you could add like ways to help you with your Exide he depression maybe to get through tough times do you know
5,Raising Disciples,"Hands down, The best motivational app I have found this far. The price of a premium membership is worth every penny! You can do so many things for instants, you can write your own motivational quote and put it on any of your personal pictures for the beautiful array of backgrounds they have on this app. I am Grateful that I have found an app that is truly meaningful to me. Thank you to the developers"
2,gotta cut loose,"The free version used to give background options behind the quote. Now there’s none. Not even one! The widget doesn’t work anymore either. So basically, you get the various quotes and that’s it. I’ve had the app about a year and enjoyed seeing the quotes on my screen. Now that the widget was taken away, I don’t go into the app to get daily quotes. Out of sight, out of mind. I’m deleting the app. I understand the need to make money and the annual fee is not that bad, but I’m not buying into it after having all the options stripped away."
1,Bigfly21,I used to feel this app was truly motivating but I have seen the quote “men are a luxury. Not a necessity. - By Cher” far too many times. I am truly offended as a man for a so called “motivational” application to promote hateful content such as this. This essentially is telling all men that we do not matter to women. What do we say to young men who might see this? That they don’t matter and aren’t needed? What would content like this do to their own confidence and self esteem? Especially for a teenager learning to become a man? This developer needs to seriously reassess the content they choose to promote and question whoever is in charge of quality control.
5,Cookin mom,PLEASE bring back the the background of the women looking away with the pink and purple background !!! PLEASE  I read your quotes every day I am a premium member and I am going through a very rough time in my life that background represents so much to me :(( you already deleted the other one that helped which was the highway going into the hills  please don’t take this one off too  PLEASE put my girl back on    Thank you
5,jlsmithgrad,"While I love the app and subscribed for premium access, I’m disappointed that the reminders aren’t working. I have it set for 30 a day, and definitely don’t get 30, I’m lucky if I get 10-15. Not sure why it isn’t working. I also use the app I Am, and have that set for 30 and I get all 30. Please fix this app so I get all the reminders I set and am paying for!!"
5,shawna.c,Love this app! Manifests and attracts positivity as almost perfectly whole I am in a thought or situation or phone call That is happening I will have a notification pop up and it’ll always be spot on to the moment I am in and is “the SECRET” type philosophy for creating change in my thoughts and also therefore changing the energy I am creating to universe ... I can’t exspresd my gratitude enough for this app!!!🔮
5,saige9807,i think this app is awesome. it really relates to what i’m going through. and i will take the advice that it gives. i love the app so much you can even change the icon of the app. the only thing that i don’t like is premium because like i want to explore more of the app but you have to get premium. i don’t want to get that just for an app that i will get notification from. An besides i’m not always on my phone.
2,Brett.welshans2000,Had this app before and loved it. It was free to use with the option to pay for extras. I got rid of the app because I didn’t use it’s much and wanted to get it again. Come to find out that you now have to pay a subscription for it. There’s not free version it’s either pay for a subscription or get nothing. It was and I am sure is still a really good app but it’s absolutely disgusting that they want you to start a subscription for something like this. Clear it’s all about money. If it were free before now reason it can’t be free now. Save your money and get a find a different app.
5,rickycaughtfire,"I installed this app on an Apple Watch that was gifted to me. This is by far my favorite app on the App Store. Reading these quotes and reflecting on them, and or putting them into practice will help you better yourself, feel better, and think more positive. If you’re someone that needs a push, inspiration, or a little motivation, this is for you.   rickycaughtfire"
1,FitForLife01,"This app is supposed to be customizable based on your preferred content. It does not do that, it sends quotes that are totally unrelated to your preferences. Most of the ones I get are sappy, overly emotional ones telling me “I am good enough” or “You are worth it, you are loved, blah blah blah”, or “You are enough, you are complete, you’re good just the way you are”. Really???!!!  Ridiculous! If I needed self-affirmation I would set my preferences for that!   My preferences are set for Workouts, Fitness, etc.  Have tried to customize it so many times but still the same.  Also, it texts numerous times per day!  Worst $30 ever spent."
5,"Mind, Body, and Soul","It’s like, constant reminders to re-ensure you that your path is your own if you choose it to be. In low moments, this app tells me things that friends don’t have the courage to say. From someone who is in the army and constantly under stress from balancing life, family, and work, this app has literally saved my soul from going into a dark place. Thank you for that, frfr!"
5,🫀🫀.,This has helped me through a lot when I feel like giving up this keeps me going yk.? And when I’m down this lifts me up I feel like this app is special yk..? And when I’m not feeling my self and people are not there for me I go to this app and it makes me believe in myself and that sometimes ion need friends I love this app it helped me through so much if I could do the same thing I would :)!
3,Care2696582,"I am disappointed with almost every quote. They are too wordy, that they lose their meaning. The quotes ramble on about 7 different subjects at once so it never flows or hits you in the heart or mind. It’s just non-sense. Some start with: you are “this positive thing” and “that positive thing”. But continue with: you are not “this negative thing” or “or that negative thing”. Well.. it started good, then you put all of that into my head. Leave the negativity out! Stay on subject! Less is more! And be more creative!"
5,Kenai Kitty,This app has taught me soooo much and has made me realize all these things about life. I would 100% recommend this to anyone. If you are dealing with anything in life this app is sure to have something to help you. And even if you don’t get premium you can still enjoy the app. There is something there for everyone no matter the situation. You will not regret downloading it.
5,casney j,So fa this app has been amazing! It gives me something to always look forward to throughout the day! As a person with stress these quotes help me throughout the day and give me a more positive outlook on life!! And when ever I’m feeling down I can always look at my favorite quotes I have saved!! Because of this I hope to be come a more positive person!! Be positive be happy and enjoy every moment because life’s short!
5,jamillarose,"This app is actually very special to me low key getting emotional typing this because it represents a empty hole in my life that is filled with uplifting hope i know it sounds cliche but these quotes are so impactful to me and my soul every day and just reading them changes my whole perspective or gives me something to think about every quote given is something I can apply to my life ,it’s real."
5,sassybritches73,"I absolutely love this app!   I read the motivation each day.  I also send a motivation quote to my co-workers, managers and supervisors at the hospital I work for.  The quotes that I would send out, I get messages back saying thank you I needed that today.   So this app is just not working and staying on my phone.  I am sharing it with others.  We are one happy medical group each day with the quotes!!"
5,marynrrrr,"Kind of embarrassing,but, the other day I was sobbing, SOBBING, over my first ever friend leaving me behind. Fortunately, I recently got this app. I started scrolling, then I found quotes that were talking about moving on. I felt better. It’s now on both my lock screen and home screen. Thank you developers. I now spend a hour a day scrolling through these on most days. 10/10!"
3,Mo610bé,"It you set up the daily reminder. It’ll notify you  for at least 1 or 2 days after it’ll stop working. You have to go back to settings to set it up again. Beside that, there are more than 7 places to set up the daily reminders which is very complex. I’m not sure what to do with all those. I read some people reviews who post their reviews before me. They mentioned the same problem but, it still not fix. So please fix this!!!!!"
5,herr 🥸,At first when I saw my friends have this app and post quotes on their story I thought it was just another boring app. Now my perspective has changed I didn’t think it would have such a strong influence on me. This app inspires me to become a better person and to forget about the bad things in my past that I would want a second chance on. Love it!!
3,AnEpicPotatoe117,"For what it’s intended to do, the app works really well!   However, I upgraded to premium so that I could view Bible Verses, and have them appear on my Lock Screen (via the Lock Screen widget functionality). The setting is available, however the Lock Screen widget consistently displays basic quotes, rather than the section I selected, even though “Bible Verses” are the only type I have selected.  Is this something that could be addressed? Thanks!"
4,gcataldo2,"I like this app, about  half the time the quotes are insightful and relevant. Sometimes it’s just enough of a nudge or a perk up needed to change perspective.  My biggest issue is that the quotes I actually click to save, do not save, and it seems every other quote that I do not engage with or even had show up on my watch or phone somehow get saved.  I also don’t like that my quote category will switch on its own."
5,How big is your wallet?,"I use both the widget and notifications and for anyone looking for inspiration and motivation throughout your day, I highly recommend this app. You can pick what types of quotes and sayings you want and the frequency you want to receive them, which I love. I am so grateful for this app and the inspiration and motivation it provides me throughout each and every day."
3,Jsgoose6,"I really like this app, especially for the watch widget (and now the Lock Screen widget), but lately there’s been tons of these stupid “I love you” and “I wish instead of missing you I was kissing you” quotes. They appear more often than any other quote. I don’t know what that’s supposed to be. It’s not motivational, it’s just weird. You can heart/favorite certain quotes, but you can’t block ones you don’t like from reappearing so I’m just stuck with them on my watch all the time."
4,AtomMoog,"Really enjoying this app.  It’s definitely robust and I’m finding it a super positive experience.  However, it could maybe use a setting to specify what gender the user is.  I’m a male, and more than once now, I’ve seen some quotes about being the best princess out there, or that I’m a queen, etc. Gender-specific quotes don’t include the entire population, and it’s alienating, unfortunately.  But that’s a small complaint when overall the app is pretty polished and useful."
4,Alpha10163720151819,"There will be times when I’m thinking something in my head and suddenly I get an update from this app with something that directly confirms what I am thinking. I’m not sure how they do it, but I’m pretty sure they can read my mind!  I do think there needs to be an option to flag or report some quotes though because on a very rare occasion I will get one that reads like a tweet or a thought from a angsty teenager and it throws me off.   Other than that one suggestion, it’s a great app."
5,Marissalicious5,"If you really feel and express emotions through quotes, this is the app for you! I don’t know how many times I have been feeling under a rain cloud, and all of a sudden a notification will appear starting the quote. Oddly, most of the quotes will go with how I’m feeling or why I am upset. I don’t ever see myself without this app. I send quotes to friends, family.. I save them. I LOVE the backdrops, especially the random category. This app is wholesome."
5,cay rod,I love how sometimes I’ll be doing nothing and then I can go on the app and look at quotes I also love all the motivational quotes this app has and how you can make your own quotes as well when I get a notification I always read it out loud so other people can hear I recommend this to any one who feels like sometimes in the middle of the day they need motivation you can also choose what topic you want it to be about
4,BrittanyMarie22291,"Love this app! I use it all the time! Anyone who likes quotes, this is definitely recommended. Endless amount of quotes..more so if you pay for the full version of course, as most apps nowadays. I do wish this app had more choices when designing your own theme, more picture choices, could choose font and font color when using one of the apps pictures for the theme but all together definitely an app I tend to use often!! (I do have the full version)"
5,Meow!Ms.Puss🌶,"A positive gentle push in the right direction and maybe I get stuck in the doom and gloom of every day living, struggling! Sometimes we just cannot get the head out of the mind , positive attitude and expanding the awareness that there is back door to leave the tight corner we get stuck in. Besides I already have a great appreciation of quotes from great authors 🧡Thank you!"
5,beaniebaby_,I love seeing these notifications come in. Each one. Even when I’m with friends. If one comes in I’ll read it to them. They make me feel warm inside. I love that there are different themes. I can’t get them all at the same time but I like the free today thing. I have quotes that make it feel like it is worth being here. This app saves me from toxic people.
5,chickencourt,"Ok I never write reviews for apps, but I honestly love this one so much. The quotes and inspiration is amazing. It really changes my day for the better. I often use the quotes as a prompt for journaling. I also find so many good ones that I find myself sending them to friends and referring to them throughout the day. If you’re looking for some really good life inspiration in a snippet this is amazing"
5,rjthakid,"I’m not opposed to developers making money off their work, but....the pricing for premium is just too high.  It would be high if it was a one-time payment, but as an annual subscription it’s pretty ridiculous.  I give it a stars for the free content but gating the beat features behind such a high cost keeps this app in the “good” category when it should honestly be “great”."
5,Nichole Sheaffer,"If you are trying to accomplish something in your life and you come across obstacles often, this is a perfect way to keep you going! The motivation app remind you to listen to that positive voice in your mind. It also reminds you, seemingly at the perfect moments, to reach down into your core and pull out the best of yourself despite the challenges that you face."
5,1228{:•),"I like this app a lot. I was looking for wallpapers for my phone when I stumbled across it. The quotes are very nice and motivating. I would like to know if you could make the app so each user gets 1 of the paid categories for free. I am an athlete and I really would like to access the sports quotes to read before games or events. Anyways, keep it up and I will definitely recommend this app to my friends."
5,Saxton.D,"I look forward to my daily motivation at 10 every night. Night time when it’s quite and it’s just you with you is when internal negative talk occurs the most. It’s nice to always have a reassuring piece of inspiration to change my thinking, which changes my actions, which molds my character making me a person that can stay strong through the process of achieve my ultimate goals."
5,Editor Person Thingy,Sometimes I feel lost or defeated and these quotes remind me that we all go through our own trials and tribulations. It reminds me that I’m not alone and to keep going. I’ve only had it for a little while but I made a widget so I can always see a different quote when I open my phone and it’s made a difference. Thank you to the creators.
3,Pnywise,I’ve only had this app for a few hours and I love it. I’ve been wanting to find something like this for a long time. I was really looking forward to the widget feature but whenever I go to add it as a widget it’s not an option available. I’ve deleted and redownloaded the app and that didn’t work. Of course when I did that I lost all of the quotes I’ve saved throughout the last few hours too even after backing up the app.
1,arichter96,"I had to get my iPhone serviced because it had some issues. When I got it back with the new iOS 17 point something and clicked on the Motivation app, it’s asking me to pay for the app either annually or monthly or something else. I’m quite annoyed because this app used to make my day, as well as others have said, but now being asked to pay a membership is not worth it to me when there’s other apps that do the exact same thing for free.   It used to be that there was a free option with ads and then a premium paid option without ads plus additional features, but with the free option you still got to see quotes/motivation. NOW I HAVE ACCESS TO NOTHING WITHOUT PAYING!!!   Even ads about this app say the following: Cost: Free with in-app subscription options for additional categories and reminders, and remove the ads Totally annoyed and bummed. Now on the hunt for a better & free app."
5,0713zoe,I am not the most positive person. I also think negatively about myself. It causes me to feel horrible and when I found this app I started to think more positively. This app had made me more happy with myself. It also helps me get through the day and tough times. I recommend downloading this app of you are having the same problems!          -Zoribelle
4,Kelly🐇🤍,"So, I really liked this app in the beginning, it was amazing! Yesterday, the widgets stopped working for me and I uninstalled. After reinstalling, it the widgets still didn’t work, it was one of my favorite part of the app. Hope this get fixed and I’ll edit this review :)  Edit: To make it more clear of the widgets not “working,” all widgets would be black and no quotes will appear.  Edit 2: The widgets were fixed and I’m really happy. Boosting up the stars :)"
5,sebastian motivacion,"Sometimes we are in a bad mood, sometimes we don’t feel that we are doing right... sometime we just need something give us a sign.... that’s what this app do for me.... give me the right word in the right moments... every work that appear on my phone is a bless and thanks to the creators for doing this app something real... I know one day it was in your mind... now it’s a reality and I truly appreciated how great is this for me...."
5,Grl26,"I have downloaded multiple apps and what I love the most about this one is its ability to change the outer face to a more personal aesthetic (background color, font, etc), the quotes are all relatable and uplifting, and it looks amazing for a quick view in widgets without having to actually access the app in itself and every time accessed generates a new quote to keep you inspired throughout the day!"
5,BACKDOOR_MAILMAN,"You don’t always need to open this app but when you’re having a day or even just a moment, it somehow catches your eye when you look at your Home Screen and always gives a quote that’ll put things in perspective. It won’t solve your problems but it will remind you to take a breath and gather yourself."
1,Raceto,"I don’t think you get why people get this app, I shouldn’t have to pay to type on a picture, I get the premium themes part but me writing on a picture I have to pay a one time thing of 35 for a year? I won’t even use this for more than a month, make your price make sense subscriptions should be for a week or less (3days) or you can even let people buy a theme and try out the app for free for a few days then have them commit but it’s a no from me off back I can get another app that won’t charge me and it’s going to take all your business away when you could’ve done the smart thing and got better reviews."
4,ibakekids,I really loge this app these quotes are really kind and help me feel better but in the app it said you can add widgets to your lock screen and i already added one to my home screen but when i try to add to my lock screen i cant find the app and even in the app it gives you a full on tutorial on how to do it but i still cant find out why they aren’t popping up
5,#lifeishorrible,"A lot of people these days, get freaked out about their phones or tablets or laptops or whatever listening to their every word and analyzing it and tracking them. However, this app somehow understands what I need to hear when I need to hear it and it lift me up when I need it and I’m pretty sure I couldn’t live without it so thank you so much."
5,Mandi5790,This app is really amazing. I hardly ever pay for apps but this was well worth the subscription it helps me stay focused in a positive way and right now that’s something I really need. The quotes are original. They are very well written and a lot of them I have never heard before. I find myself putting a heart next to almost every quote That comes up. I just truly love this app.
5,EuropeanNessa,"I’m not sure how i came about this app except for when i was feeling low. I thought had to buy it and i do not tend to purchase apps.. however I was still receiving the messages, and let me tell you.. they have helped tremendously! Always uplifting and honestly would show up at the times i really needed to see the messages the most."
4,genepost,I love the quotes but I hate how the review notifications stop so much. I’ll realize all of a sudden I haven’t been getting notifications in a couple of days and it’s because I have to keep opening the app to “set reminders” it used to just always notify me daily with the amount of times a day I set it too. I don’t know why they decided to make us open the app every other day to continue the reminders
5,jt favor,"This app has been such a blessing to me. It’s not like any other app that I’ve used, and to be honest I can’t even remember when I first downloaded it, but since then it’s been amazing !!! Right in time ALL of the time with a Word that definitely lifts your spirit ! Occasionally even personalizes quotes and words for you which is cool ! I love this app ! Shout out to the creators !"
1,kkkkkkkkkkhgggsk,"I'm a user of motivation, new to this app, but I wanna say, this is the worst application ever which made me angry over it for days! I downloaded this app by accident and started a free trial to try, then after several days, I got charged for 12 dollars. I hope you can kindly explain these to me: 1. I understand that it's auto-renew once I started the free trial (how silly of me), but there's no way in this app to cancel this !!!!!  ( you write it there""cancel anytime"" but how?? & where??)   2. Why's the auto-renew for one year??? not one month? (just because more money cheated will benefit you guys?) 3. After been charged 12 dollars, I still got nothing from this app, the account status is still like the visitor, money just doesn't work!!! ( the pics attached are the current ones AFTER the money is stolen. ) 4. Soooooooo many ads!!  (ok I can bear this AS LONG AS you provide good services, but...)  I called the app store service, but they had no idea how to get back my money."
1,Famous One,I downloaded this when I was massively depressed and I just wanted the occasional pick me up. The first few days I was like eh… but then I paid for a year. With all due respect AI could generate better material- and I gather this is actually AI just not used well. I thought I’d get quotes that were profound or that were from people of importance… but the like 5th time I say You Only Live Once as my motivation… uhhh I feel like I threw my $30 in a bucket and set it on fire. I’ve cancelled so there isn’t a chance of renewal but there must be something better than this obvious cash grab.
5,naekomie,"Anytime I feel hurt, feel like running away, or anything else I always open this app! It calms me down remembering that I should hang in there and never give up! One of my favorite quotes are,”If you were to die tomorrow is this worth being mad about”. It always makes me think twice! Thank you creators of motivation you guys should be proud because YOU GUYS changed my life!"
2,i <3 knitting,"So far, I’m enjoying the quotes… However, as someone who is widely read and will often go look up additional works by motivational authors or speakers if I stumble upon something of theirs I like, this app falls short.  Now I have to copy and paste the quote text into a search engine and pray that someone famous enough said it so that I can find the correct attribution. I was really hoping this wouldn’t be yet another “with four wrong names attached” or “with no names attached” quote app.  Unless this is fixed, I won’t be renewing my subscription."
5,TheJDeezy,"My hair stylist turned me on to the app, we were talking about the importance of positive thinking and she told me how effective and helpful Motivation has been in her daily life. I have been on Motivation for 2 months now and can see a profound difference in my thinking, I feel generally more positive about my life and possibilities. Do it."
5,🐙🐊🦧🐖🐬🦬🐟🦘🐬,I love this app because it is very helpful and makes you think of things on the better side. You can personalize the app and make it your own. Over all I love this app and it brings me joy. One problem is that you can’t get everything because you have to pay for a membership but on the other hand this is overall a great app.
5,cupcakequeen36,"I recently ended up getting laid off from my job due to COVID-19 and wanted to find creative ways to lift up my spirits during this unprecedented time. I found this app on Instagram and decided to download it on my smart phone. I start my mornings off on a positive and end my nights on a positive note. Even though there’s a variety of topics to choose from, there’s light at the end of the tunnel."
5,C1111.,"My widgets are not working and are only showing a black background since the last update, and this is easily the third time I have gone through this. I however honestly love this app! Excellent daily quotes that you can change to fit the motivation you are craving for whatever you are going through!!! 👍👍👍"
3,paetyn jj,"I love the app but I’m not liking how I can’t get quotes for self love without paying for it. This is the whole reason I purchased the app and it think this app is mainly supposed to help with things people are dealing with, otherwise the app is useless. I love the reasoning for getting this but I don’t see why I should keep it on my phone If I can’t use it for the purpose I wanted it for. I will keep it for a little while longer and see if I want it but if I have to keep paying for something so little as a quote I will take it off."
3,The VioletPotato,"So I have to either go premium or watch an add for everything. It’s irritating and I only have used it for a day. I have a lot of favorites and it shows me three of them and then says “Go premium to see all of your favorites!!” Seriously? I only gave it three stars because I liked the quotes and a few backgrounds ( which I had to watch an add to get ). Also why can’t I jump between fonts/backgrounds?? I watch an add for one and another catches my eye, I get that one too and go the other one just to see “Watch an add!! Or Go premium” 🙄😬"
3,RNkins,"I love this app and all the great quotes!  BUT...  I was disappointed that to search certain topics I would have to pay a monthly fee.  Same issue came about when I wanted to go back and look at my ‘favorites’ that I saved, have to pay.  If this app offered a one time reasonable fee I would be more than happy to pay.  I do enjoy the reminders and everything else about this app.  If a one time fee ever becomes an option, I would love to know!  In the meantime I will enjoy the free version, as the quotes are great and inspirational."
5,iPAC™,"I LOVE THIS APP! ❤️ I've always been into quotes and scriptures to help maintain a positive mindset and to help motivate me to be a better version of myself—this app is the superpower that helps me achieve that goal.  Its simple and customizable user interface is pleasing to the eyes and enables you to make the app yours. The iPhone Home-Sreen Widget is my favorite feature. Just a glance at my phone, and there I see a new quote that helps give me a boost whenever I need it.   This powerful tool won me so much that I purchased the optional Premium version for a year. This In-App Purchase isn't required to get a great experience; however, I enjoy supporting great developers who enrich and benefit my life.   THANKS TO THE DEVELOPERS for a SUPERB app. I LOVE IT! ❤️"
5,defnotahona,"Honestly I was going through a time in April 2023 with a toxic friend and she blackmailed me and controlled me for almost 3 years ( I was friends with her for 5-6 years )   I got myself out of the situation finally and downloaded this app, I think this app is amazing because it reminds you of your worth and what you’ve been through and that you’re a survivor."
5,ekpdm,This is such an amazing app and I am so glad I got it. I feel like some days the quotes just really stick out to me. There is one thing I wish there was more stuff for free there is a lot of stuff but I wish there was more. I am starting a podcast and some of these quotes are great for it. Thank you so much for creating an app like this for people. It really helps people be motivated
5,King Charmjack,"I normally don’t write reviews on ANYTHING, but this app is the exception.  This is tailored for your mindset whether it’s self esteem, depression, break-ups, relationships, self love this app tackles it all from quotes to famous minds to the whimsical artist, athletes that have propelled themselves to greatness.  Not to mention the THEMES ARE AMAZING.  From amazing city scapes to ambience of coy fish in water. Or a shot of nature in its purest elements. I highly recommend."
4,writeaset,"I really like this app. The motivation I really like. I love how there are a ton of different quotes and they truly are motivating. The only problem is they keep asking me to pay 15 dollars a year to get the “premium” and it’s annoying because every time I log in they say it’s my “last chance!” to get the offer but it just keeps popping up. I love the app but please change this, it’s really annoying."
5,Amb20162017,"This app is so fabulous. There is a premium feature. It’s only 0.99 for a month if you do the yearly plan. Although even without premium you get so many quotes. I look at quotes on google a lot and most of these quotes I’ve never seen. Plus the notifications with quotes are fantastic, you can adjust how many quotes to want sent a day as well. All in all this app is amazing. I definitely do recommend this app."
1,Selvius,"Pretty pricey for snippets of other people’s writing. I strongly recommend people explore the manifold free sources of this material, including making a free shortcut that does the same thing.   All this developer’s apps appear set up to deliberately coax the user into accidentally subscribing to overpriced services. I had to cancel my mother’s subscription, which she had no idea she’d made. Finally, the fact that there are four different versions of this app which deliver slightly different content, each with its own overpriced in-app purchases, shows what this app truly is: a quick-and-dirty cash grab at expense of those searching for hope."
5,K00L9,My widget is just blank and not refreshing after updating to the latest version. Re-adding the widget hasn’t resolved the issue. Also the widget I keep on my Mac desktop completely disappeared and I’m unable to add it back as motivation isn’t in my widget list anymore. Haven’t deleted and reinstalled the app yet.  Hard reset resolves this…..  App is great guys
5,Manders2023,"I enjoy this app 💯💯✅. Gives me great motivation and courage and especially when our names are in it makes it more inspirational to give that boost of motivation we all need. I recommend this app to anybody who wants that boost of fantastic motivation to give it a try, you won’t be disappointed if you get a chance to try it out for free and it is worth it."
5,A tramples heart,"This app is amazing! Every time I hear the little beep on my phone and I look, the motivational quote that’s coming through is perfect like it was written just for me in my mind. I’m going through a really tough moment in my life. I read the quote and it’s just a little confirmation or where I can hold my breath, exhale and feel a little relief and worth. Thank you!!!"
5,Mari3hh,This app really motivated me I’m going through a lot right know and every quote that show up is so accurate of what is going on my personal life even my daughter said omg how they know I’m like I don’t know but I love it cuz I have really low self-esteem and this give me hopes and motivation who ever did this app let me tell you: YOU ARE AMAZING! You deserve a lot of blessings thank you so much for doing this 💕💕🥰
5,alicatyates,"I’m Absolutely Obsessed! When Depression gets you down, Read These Quotes And You’ll feel Much better! I’m 23 and have had a Few Tragic Things Happen to Me Including Fake Friends. When Life Gets Ya Down, Read these Quotes. Being Depressed is a Bad Feeling, and I cannot Afford Therapy. But When I read these Quotes I feel Motivated to get out of bed. I hope this App Motivates you to Do things. Lots of Love to all who are Depressed During Covid-19! -Audrey <3"
3,vsco famous freshman,"Here’s the thing, I enjoy the app most of the times but I’ve gotten some ridiculous quotes. One that stood out to me the most was “Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody want to die.” This quote in my opinion is inappropriate to have on a motivation app. What kind of motivation is that. That quote isn’t true either. I know several people in my life who have wanted to die and some even got their wish. This quote isn’t motivation and I’ve gotten others similar to this. That quote should be taken down. Other than that, it’s a good-ish app."
5,fun game 163847,"I love this app ever sense I got it I was able to handle anything by just reminding myself with this app! I used to get bullied a lot but now it doesn’t bother me at all! I have just one suggestion, can you put more quotes written by actual people cause some of them are just random. For example “don’t let idiots ruin your day” even though their are only one or two of these pls put more actual quotes thank you!"
5,Jamie0107,"I very rarely pay for an App & less often do I write a review......however, this app is so good I had to purchase the annual subscription & write this review.  The quotes are truly motivational & not just the same generic words repeated in different forms.  The many categories are great as well! I also love that you can save your favorites & refer back to them. Very user friendly.  Definitely recommend without hesitation!!"
5,"A blessed, inspiration woman","The reason why I enjoy the motivation app is because they keep me motivated in my spirit. They keep my spirit up and it gives me positive thought to read throughout the day, and I could share with many of my friends that I am very close with. The motivation app rocks. I love it very much. I would like to continue using the Motivation app."
3,Bintycat,"This app has the potential to really be amazing.. but for someone who is stuck in a minimum wage job and miserable and EVERY single dollar counts. Asking for a lump sum up front, sounds like a company that really just wants your cash with NO care about your personal development.   Which let’s face it…  is a random quote generator robot to send u quotes that reflect your faves!! (Personally I like the idea of people NOT robots offering me motivation and support.) So until the billing changes to MONTHLY then I’m a no!!"
5,user13681,I love this app it really helps with people that have issues and need reminder/reassurance that it’s not all bad but the sad part is now there charging to Use the app for wallpaper etc which is ridiculous to me and hope they change that. So 3 stars from me but will still continue using the app.
5,finnshandss,"I was looking up pinterest quotes and decided to see if their was an app that would show you just quotes and eventually, I came across this app. I immediately downloaded it and ever since I got it, Its been my comfort app for sure. The quotes are inspirational and have helped me. I love this app and would for sure recommend if you need inspirational, motivational, self esteem, ect quotes. :)"
5,mandisia,"When you think that your alone...one or a few kind words could save you from a downward thought ; (embrace)… Believe & those words will come always on time! , Because the Universe is always trying to wake you up & keep you woke ! To see hear & feel all that has been hidden, to be found & received & kept with love 💕"
5,Stace59,"I loooovvvvveeeeee this app!!! It’s very motivational and relaxing!!! I read about 20 a day!!! I love quotes, reading and my favorite color is YELLOW! 💛💛💛 this app is honestly the best! I read one in the morning and about 19 more a day! 💛🌼💖🌸 thanks for having me write a review! Here’s a quote I made up:  sometimes the best thing is to stay quiet and basically all the time you should fight for what you believe in! Thanks"
5,:)hElLo ThErE,"I love this app so so much!!! I have been going through so much recently with my friends but when I scroll through and see this relatable quotes, it feels like I’m journaling but less stressful lol. My favorite parts are how I get to customize what I look at, can just look through my favorites if I’m sad, and I can add my own quotes. I would absolutely recommend!"
4,Figbee Ramsbottom,"I doubt I’d ever pay even tho 20 for a year isn’t bad tbh. As far as the free version is concerned I hate having ads pop up often when  I’m scrolling a bit, tryna add to a collection, or saving the image to my photos. I wish this was one of those apps that had an ad banner. I prefer those on apps that gotta have ads then ad pop ups. Aside from ads  I really like this app, great motivation 👍🏾."
4,Brooke Beiler,"Motivation is such a good app to use! It has a bunch of cool features like liking your favorite quotes, folders for different topics, etc. But one of the things that they could change about it is that you have to pay for certain things. It would helpful if it was all free and I wouldn’t have to pay for anything. Other then that I live this app and it helps with so much stuff."
5,Dancer devil,So my brother is very annoying and this has helped me calm down and I’m like a sponge 🧽 and when I go by people I pick up there feeling so for in example let’s say I’m happy and somebody else is sad I will pick that up and i will be happy and sad at the same time now some times it can be very difficult but I haven’t to move on in life and help
1,OhEmJaynaaay,"The widget for this app stopped working a couple months ago and even after doing everything I can using the app’s “Widgets” FAQs, it still displays a black box and no quote inside it. It’s been very frustrating because I’ve loved having this app, especially for years now. I ended up just deleting it completely since it seems the problem hasn’t been getting fixed (referencing other reviews with the same problem).  Update: Widgets are still absolutely not working even when updating to the latest version of the app."
5,Marzable21,I am so in love with Motivation app . The last couple days I was so scared when it didn’t rotate different quotes on my Apple Watch. I had to keep resetting the watch nothing happens. I wanted to cry because motivation app keeps me going when I feel down . I was so happy when they said they had fix this . Please don’t ever let that happen again lol.
5,Trying to help you.,I loveee this app! I think it’s great and it’s really been helping me during this time in COVID. My only thing is that they also have the affirmations app attached to it and it’s too pricey to spend another $20 a year for the other app as well because I just don’t think the affirmations app should be as costly. Please try to make the motivation and affirmation apps a bundle! I’d happily spend $30/year for both!
3,Hannahvh,"I downloaded this as a way to train my brain back into positive thinking after traumatic events in my life. The design of the app and the way it can be easily seen on your phone is really cool. The quotes however always felt bossy to me as they were mostly all stated as commands to basically feel something other than what I am feeling (ie “Be this type of person,” “Prove them wrong,” etc). The quotes do not make me feel uplifted and actually feel a bit stressful."
4,izzysme12,"Lately the widget it not working. It just shows blank. I love this app and all the positive words it shares. It’s the first thing I looked at as a widget when I unlocked my phone. Now I have removed it since it’s an issue that needs to be resolved. Until this issue is fixed my review will remain 4 stars, because this still is a great app to have even if I have to take the extra step in finding the app and opening it up myself."
4,BrittNillz,"I really like this app to the point of falling I love with it. I honestly can’t afford to purchase it. I’am ok with the free version. My only complaint it I have an iPhone 10R and my mother has an iPhone SE and she can save any motivation  to her photos and I cannot, if you could some how some way make it to where everyone who has this app can save any motivation, if they choose to. I mean you have the option to save the motivation/quote but yet in still you can’t save it."
5,Dannyful00117,"If I could give this more stars I would. I am the type of guy that needs to be reminded that everything will be okay. This app practically saved my life and helped me get going. It used the right quotes at the right time and really helped get through some tough times and for such a low price. Bless the creators of this app, I will truly appreciate it forever."
5,chelschrey,"It’s a simple app and I love it just for that. As we all are, I was getting too attached to my phone. Constantly looking at it and feeling my mood get dragged down every time I did. I decided I needed something to bring a little joy so I downloaded a few apps that send you daily quotes and this is the only one that has survived. Receiving the daily motivation can make such a huge change!"
5,AnimeshJohri,"This app is a must have for all the generations of people. The people who work for this app are super positive, spiritual, kind and concerned about the bad this social media is doing. Please it’s a humble request to download this app and spare few seconds of the day to spend on this. This is a humble request from a successful IT professional and a die-hard fan of a Yogi from west i.e US 🙂😇🙏"
3,veej85,I’ve been paying for the app for years. I’ve even suggested that they updated the issue that I have with the app. It always asks you to reset reminders. Ok fine. They said they can’t do it because it’s not easy. Whatever. But every time it pops up now my app stops working for 1-3 days. I think this might be the last year I pay for this because it’s annoying. Otherwise the app is good when it’s working.
1,roguewolfe,"When this app first came out it was almost completely free(uninterrupted quotes, some personalization, and some categories were under subscription). Lately however i cannot personalize my selection because i can’t afford their prices. I can’t pick out the things that will help me because they are now all locked.  I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and this app was helping me get the encouragement i needed to make it through the day. Now, when i get a notification for a quote, I can’t even look at it cause it’s not what i need."
2,Jenna Cakes,"I use to get frustrated when attempting to save a quote that popped up on my widget, only to have it change to a different quote upon tapping the widget.  Now I can’t save, edit, add, or even access my saved lists.  As soon as the app opens the screen goes blank and the app closes/crashes.  I thought about deleting it and then re-downloading it…but I don’t want to lose all of my lists & likes.    It’s disappointing because I really, really loved it prior to this last update. 😒"
5,Some~One4Me❣️,"I don’t subscribe to a lot. I normally cancel before the subscription begins, but this motivational app has been such spiritual healing, motivating empowering investment. I love to see it on my home screen in the morning upper left  hand corner. It  seems to have the  right quote at the right time, they have uplifted  me so many times and I appreciate it."
2,1234katathome,"This seems like a nice concept, but charging people $50 a year to send motivational quotes on their phone just seems excessive. Yeah, they have a three day trial...After which point they automatically charge your credit card until you go in and figure out how to cancel it. No thanks. There are plenty of FREE resources online. It also seems a little gross to be making money off people during middle of a global pandemic. A lot of people are seriously struggling and depressed. Many will download this app and pay for it because they’re desperate for any relief."
5,Reece ykt💞,"Motivation is really the motivation you need frfr. By using this app you will become a better person, by reading daily quotes. Because you read these quotes you will gain confidence and feel like yourself when your at your lowest. When you are at your lowest, read Motivation quotes & your mood would literally change."
4,Rhi Ve,This app is absolutely amazing. It helps me everyday and really make me feel like a better person overall. This app has given me EXTREMELY great quotes and sayings everyday. The only reason I gave it 4 start instead of five is because to personalize it more it cost money which I feel like should not. Otherwise great app and definitely recommend it!! I haven’t paid a dime and love this app to pieces😍😍
2,MynicknameisKc,If you want to be self affirmed in your beliefs fine but if you want to be challenged and have lasting good growth you need to seek Jesus because Jesus is the only way to peace and love and salvation from ourselves in our sin from the wrath of God that is due to all who have sinned which is all. Please repent and believe the Gospel of the Lord Jesus which is Him being sent by God to be the atonement and then living perfectly then dying on the cross brutally and rising again 3 days later to fulfill the wrath of God and to bring peace between the believer and God
5,by fluffy stuffins,Monkey Taps’ collection of apps are some of the best I’ve ever come across. These are amazing 100% would recommend. Only problem I’m having trouble figuring out how to put widgets on my Home Screen. Other than that 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 EDIT: Hi again! Its been less than a week and I figured out how to do the widgets. Thank you developers for responding to this!
5,vpeen,"I honestly love this app. I get modern quotes, older sayings, Bible verses and other artists/writers’ work. I don’t really get the same ones. There are options to include a certain subject/matter/emotion/lifestyle, etc and they offer a variety of backgrounds. This is just the free version. You can upgrade to premium. I bet it’s even better. I may have to try it out ✌🏻"
1,DJ markoff,"Why are so many of the reminders toxic, selfish, negatively phrased? And why do half the reminders seem focused on ending negative relationships? There are other important things to do out there…    Not what I’m looking for in a positive motivation app.  For instance:  Stop wasting your time on people who treat you good one day, and then act like you didn't exist the next day.   No matter how many times a snake sheds its skin, it will always be a snake. Remember that before allowing certain people back into your life.   If you walked away from a toxic, negative, abusive, one-sided, dead-end low vibrational relationship or friendship--you won.  Your life will get better when you realize it's better to be alone than to chase people who don't really care about you.   Don't let your loyalty become slavery. If they don't appreciate what you bring to the table, let them eat alone.   I"
5,Coca_Cola-UvU,"I just got it and I love it but idk about the paying. Hear my thoughts:  Well, I put it on my widgets, and set the timer to start to 6:00 am to 10:00 pm bc I have to wake up around like 6:30 or 6:45 and I see that when I wake up, because nobody really likes me (besides like 3 ppl) and they are very nice and this helps me boost/start up up my day. Have a great day"
5,julesegg,"I LOVE these people whoever they are!  I started using this app a couple years ago and liked it but I wanted more functions and enhanced UX like:  - customize my reminders - ✅ - add my own quotes - ✅ - create my own collections and categories - ✅✅  I emailed them and they did it.  I LOVE using this app and have made multiple widgets on my Home Screen for different topics.  I save quotes/images all the time and share them with everyone because there is a category for EVERYTHING.  My kids may be sick of my “motivational tips” but they are often better than a kiss and a band-aid.    Just OUTSTANDING.   Thanks! Jules, (just a mom who loves this and not a paid reviewer)"
5,mike123123345,"I use this app to find quotes to post in the gym to help people through tough times while recovering from various conditions from strokes, amputations and spinal cord injuries. People stop and take pictures of the quotes to help them through their days. There are so many quotes to choose from and tons of backdrops.  The premium membership would be nicer to allow for even further personalization."
5,"nevada, las vegas","This app is amazing, when I read all of these quotes I feel better and better, they motivate me to move on and do better. I appreciate you making this app for people who need to be more happier and need to be confident in life, then just thinking that they are useless and that they need to give up in life. Once again thank you for making this app, you have a great heart."
5,saaleshire,This app is amazing and I have thoroughly enjoyed it but the monthly service payment will probably make me not keep it much longer. I’d even happily pay a heftier one time charge but the monthly fee is just too much. I would have given it 5 stars but the charge made me change it to 4. Too bad. The quotes are always new & motivating. The font & color options are cool & modern.
5,bella_15_k,"I want sure if I was going to keep the app at first, at first I was like, “probably just gonna delete the app.” (Before I even got on it) but now I’m like where has this been I would have loved this app back in like 2019. I love this app so much, the quotes are SO relatable and they actually help a lot, i 100% recommend getting this app!"
5,Pedey009,This app is amazing and certainly helping me through a tough patch in my life. So many good things being taken away from the app. Only thing I wish was available was the ability to sort from most recent instead of having to scroll all the bottom for ones I’ve saved.
5,cmhcah,"Every time I’m feeling a little or a lot… angry, down, even just without direction?  This app comes through and gives me so much.  I have one suggestion?  More fabulous pics?  Thanks so much for all.  You’ve saved my sanity, pride and redirected me to better things!  Peace and grace to all of you!"
2,bkate_11,Not sure what prompted you to remove most of the custom features. From two dozen fonts to 5 all of which might as well be Times New Roman or Arial as boring and overused as they are. Backgrounds...still alright. Quotes...ugh. Another area of extreme disappointment. From 40 options to 12...a major reason I loved this app was for the nuances...felt extremely customized to me. The quotes are awful and have seen the same one three times and it was definitely not a favorite. What's up Monkey Taps? Oh...I am a premium user.
5,BoxerMomma174,"I love this app! It’s so adorable! It is so nice that I can open my phone and see the notification it gives me that is a motivational quote. It brightens my day! 🥰 The only thing I would like more is that if it had snowy/Holiday season themes to add, but I’m sure those are seasonal as was the Halloween ones. This app is so cute! The widgets are awesome, too! I love how it refreshes the quotes so I can get a new one! I would highly recommend this app!"
5,jsgajana,"i’m going through a hard time right now, my best friends for 6+ years including the boy i love and his sister who is like my sister, both stopped talking to me and i’m really said. but anyways this app is amazing and i was so so surprised. it lets you change the app icon FOR FREE, and lets you change the themes and create your own FOR FREE with just an ad. it lets you create your own quotes FOR FREE! DOWNLOAD THIS ITS A 10/10!!!"
5,Michael Shirabad,"This app will be a daily notification that won’t make your heart sink as others can. In the midst of a crazy day. These subtle yet powerful messages will relieve you and put your thought process on the right track.  Definitely recommend this app for everyone! And remember:   “ try to think about what if things go right, rather than what if they go wrong”"
5,KiKaVeeVee,"I absolutely love this app. Receiving daily quotes from the app really does have a positive impact on my day. If I’m having a rather stressful day receiving a quote from this app brings a smile to my face, heart and soul. Everyone should download this app, I know everyone will love these quotes as much as I do. I can't wait to unlock all the other types of quotes. Mindfulness, Love way to many to name them all. I absolutely ❤️💕🌹💛 this app."
4,justj12312,Love the app and the random notifications to keep you going throughout the day! Sometimes a quote to give you that push is just what’s needed and my productivity and confidence has boosted with this addition to my phone. I wish more than one category was available for selection at a time without purchasing the different quote packs. That’s the only downfall! But even without purchasing I have yet to see a quote I’ve seen before.
4,bunnybots,I love this game it relaxing when I have had a bad day. There’s only one problem and it’s that almost everything cost money and the premium cost a lot. But I really do love the quotes and the backgrounds they do give you are pretty nice. There’s just one more problem that when you try to make your own quotes it glitches pretty bad but it’s a really really good game and I would so recommend it to someone who is depressed or gets stressed easily. I love the game!
5,🤓a person 🤓,This app is very positive I love this! My sister asked me for my phone and downloaded this and she made me an wallpaper and she put an message I honestly cried about how cute that is and I wake up everyday ready to start the day just because of this positive message! (SUGGESTION) I suggest you download this app! It’s very good and helpful for starting the day!!!(have an great day that’s it!)
2,Chile Smiles,"I’ve loved this app since February of 2021!!  Yet, for the last 9 weeks, every time I would either click on the app or click on the widget, it kept forcefully closing the app on me!  I just deleted the app from my iPhone and LOST EVERYTHING when redownloading the app!!!!  Why on earth would you all not have a “restore” option!?  Beyond frustrated and disappointed.  The quotes on this app, however, are perfect!  **Would love to give y’all back the five stars once this glitch is fixed."
5,Mia is hungry,"I think this is an awesome app. I love how you can choose quotes to heart and add your own. Something I would add is a button where all your notifications are from your likes quotes only. The app can be glitchy once in a while, but not to the extent where you can’t even open the app.  Lastly, I think the creators should make all the themes free."
3,rawbunnn,"THERE IS SO MANY AD’s, that it’s not helpful. I really need this app because it helps with my anxiety, but there’s so many ads it’s starting to become a issue. When trying to change the time you want to have the reminders show on your screen, an app pops up for about 30 secs.. each time I click on the icon an ad pops up and won’t  allow me to change it.. even when the ad ends another one pops up."
5,Justdoit.Mars.loves.you,"I got this app thinking “hey I love quotes, this is cool” but now I check it everyday and absolutely love it! I have nothing but positive things to say about it.   You can set reminders to have random quotes pop up on your phone during the day and somehow they always relate to your situation or are simply a great reminder to enjoy life.   Seriously, get this app. You won’t regret it."
5,Zaya_mz,"If you haven’t downloaded this app, you have missed a lot .. you don’t have to feel negative to have it .. it helps on many ways ..  you need daily reminders to organize your thoughts and feelings to not lose your focus.  Try it 🤍   I wish all the best including who worked on this nice app. 🤍🤍"
2,AiLe2018,"Pretty cool app... I personally think the developers are a little ballsy with how many of the motivational items are “locked” and require you to pay for them..I mean, in this economy?? So yeah I don’t think it’s worth the money but I guess it decently cool because of the pop-up reminders. But seriously... it’s just quotes from Pinterest, there’s seriously no need to pay for the “locked features on this app” lol. I’m sorry but that’s the honest truth!! Good concept tho guys!! Just a wildly capitalistic approach to “self-care”, which is.... disappointing to say the least"
4,Llamacorn260,"This is a very nice thing to do. But I just have one issue.  Personally, I got this app for my mental health. I felt like it would make me feel much better everyday. But-after being asked to pay made me really bummed, because why would I want to pay to get a simple quote every hour or so? I got the app to make me feel better..I don’t want to pay an app for a quote. Don’t get me wrong! It’s a very good app! I just think it’s wrong to make one pay."
3,ChipperChelseaK,"I have LOVED this app but find it so frustrating that if I see a quote I like on a widget and want to “heart” it so it’s on my list of favorites, the quote is different when the app opens and gives me a new one that also goes on the widget. The pop ups in the app when not renewing a subscription is also frustrating. I don’t need 4 pop ups (two verifying and one giving me a discount that I then have to verify I still don’t want.)"
4,tanrahman,Absolutely love scrolling through for a quick motivational boost. I started adding quotes to my collections because it’s related to specific things occurring my life. I would love to have a way to write a reflection note for each quote I save. How does this quote apply to my life right now or in the past. What does this quote inspire me to do? It would be such a lovely feature to have!
5,nataliaisabel8,"You do have to pay for majority of the items on the app... I do have a certain time(s) for when inspiring quotes sends me a notification and it’s usually a couple of minutes before I wake up and it’s been life changing!! There’re many different positive, motivation quotes and I love it! It always helps me to keep the positivity going!"
5,Minecraft dork,No one has ever said to me “Stop worrying about who you can’t be and realize who you are” THIS APP said that to me. I’m insecure and constantly sad it’s like my life is falling apart so those quotes were inspiring. I’m tired of being put down so when I need to be boosted up I come to this app because it makes me realize so much about myself.
5,FSablan,"I go through my day as a service member in the Marines and seeing these motivational quotes that pop up on my watch or phone just dials me back in to work harder, faster, and spread the motivation to everyone around. Whether at the Gym or at home, the quotes just give me a reminder to remember my purpose and my reason to being a little better than yesterday!  Semper Fidelis,  Staff Sergeant of Marines"
5,AMAZINGROBLER,"I never thought this app could change my mind, choice, or even my life. This app encourages me to live, even during hard times. At first, I thought I would just download this and not use it, but now I use it every day, motivating life, and making life feel divine. Highly recommend this app to every age, gender, etc."
4,BriannaSharee,I decided to take affirmations seriously this year as last year was hell for me. This app helps keep my mind positive and focused throughout the day. I have 3 reminders set each day so I don’t get annoyed with the notifications and they pop up with something new each time. I would love more themes available for free but I understand the factor of money. There are a few really cute free themes already so it’s not a problem for me. I enjoy the app
5,.h.a.d,"This app is amazing, I use the widget future in the front screen of my phone and I always make sure to read my quote before putting in my password, and that always make me feel confident in myself, and it’s always something that brightens up my day, especially when I’m feeling down."
5,pooh_bear09,"I don’t right reviews, like ever but I have made an exception. I love this app just because of how it relates to different situations. Like mine for example, I deal with a lot of stress and anxiety and trying to bet perfect for other people and in my feed it gives me the best advice/quotes and I love it so much. Look I know it a short review but I do recommend."
4,DaniiR27,"I like the inspiring quotes that you guys offer for free. However, I dislike the fact that the quotes stop popping up on my phone which makes me need to go open up the app in order to make the quotes start popping up again. Very smart move by you guys because I know that influences more people to buy your memberships, but it’s really annoying."
5,Luckyheffanot...,"I love  in my worse moments a quote from this app appears saying the very things my soul and my spirit are in need of. It reminds me no matter the day I'm having , I'm gonna make through and I'm going to be a better and stronger person. Healing from traumas, grief, diappointments and death are no easy task. This app has brightened some of my darkest moments for that I'm THANKFUL."
5,Natanboy,Thanks to whoever made this app. It’s only done good for me. And sometimes things happen and a quote pops up with exactly what I need to hear to help me learn from that situation. I’ve been having a tough time with some things so thanks for helping me keep cool and always be the bigger person.
5,K. Fergg,"These are perfect little reminders throughout the day. They seem to say just what I need to hear/remember. I added a widget to my home page so it’s the first thing I see when I unlock my phone. I take a breath, read the quote- proceed with my good day! :)  A week later and I am SO thankful to have this widget on my Home Screen. It really helps me stay focused on the bigger picture. THANK YOU"
1,leesieradzky,"All other top reviews must be paid. BEWARE!!   This app went on a full out blitzkrieg to blow up my phone with their advertisements. All in the while, every ad advertised free quotes, free motivation, etc.   I finally downloaded the app to see I have 3 days before I need to fork up $20 for some words?! Get out of here. Don’t take me all the way to the finish line only to bend me over and take my money before I cross over.  Instantly deleting. Wouldn’t recommend. Only to people who can afford to pay $20 for someone else’s copyrighted quotes."
5,ChristineCleve,"I love this app. I have come to depend on the messages which support me during this challenging year. The pandemic has brought out the very best in people and the very worst in them too. When I confront negativity from other or within myself, you quotes give me inspiration to stand strong against the adversity.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
5,nylashaekiomie,I’ve only had it for two days but the quotes literally make me rethink life. I’ve been working so hard on things for school and i’m so proud of myself but there’s always some sort of negative energy that brings me down. These quotes really change my whole perspective of the situation and I feel so much better about myself i’m not even joking! No app has ever done that for me!
5,GrannyAngelmarie,"Each morning, this app reminds me of how much I am loved by my Heavenly Father. Although I’m still mourning the loss of my mother, I know that it’s okay to smile again. Although I still get choked up, it’s okay to laugh. Although I still get frozen from the pain of this loss, it’s okay to move forward one small step at a time. This app helps me to breathe with one less tissue in hand. Thank you."
4,Kmichhhh,"I truly do love this app and I tell everyone I know to download it! The reason I gave it 4 stars versus the full 5 is because I don’t like that I have to set it daily to have notifications. I wish there was a way I could set notifications and they would just always come up. And yes while I understand it’s a minor thing to have to do, it’s not something I remember to do, so I don’t even think to look at the app."
5,Lilly taylor76,"I love this app so much. I’ve been really hard on Myself, and I scroll to read these quotes and I really believe in it and I’ve thought about more positive thoughts the first two days of having the app. If your the kind of person that needs help with anxiety, depression, relationships, setting goals, etc download this app right now!<3"
5,8295593,"I love this app, it sends me notifications ALL through out the day with positive messages. In one weeks time I have noticed an incredible change in my thoughts from always being the most negative person in the room, to being thrown off by my own positive responses to situations. It is worth every single penny!!"
5,Yaraalhasani,"This app… is absolutely incredible, brilliant and soul changing. I absolutely love the quotes, they’re so inspiring, motivating & will literally put you back on track whenever you feel like giving up. I can’t thank the developers enough for creating such a simple yet outstanding app, thank you  so much from the bottom of my heart."
5,Ellecea,"This is the best quote/motivation app that I’ve ever downloaded. It has such great quotes that I really relate to. AND you can share them with other people and on your socials. When I look at apps to download, I always look at the reviews and there is always such confusing reviews about the apps, but you can trust this review fully."
1,Gena BoBena,"I used to live by this app. Opened it everyday. Got notifications. I would send motivational stuff to friends, and they ended up downloading the app too. But now, everything is locked. There isn’t any free videos at all!! I don’t mind paying for any subscription, but this is a little ridiculous. I can google quotes anywhere. And there a million apps for those too. But Motivation was unique. The videos and voice overs were awesome. Not worth my time now. I found something new.  Sometimes app creates lose sight of why they created the app in the first place. That’s a shame.  *deleted*"
5,Cr00sh L00sh,I love the way this app allows me to schedule my motivational needs and helps me start my day every morning with a positive mindset. I’ve really felt and seen a change in my productivity and positivity not only in work but also in my personal life. I cannot recommend this app enough for those who need that extra push to get thru your day!
5,-N.A.C.,This app literally gets me up in the morning. It makes the start of my day so much better. The reminders are very helpful during the day and the quotes definitely gets me thinking about what I want for my future. I definitely recommend this app to people who need daily motivation. It’ll help you get through the toughest and the best times of your life. . . Go download now !
3,tbell72584,"The app does what it says it will do and does it well. However, there are critical features missing. Specifically, the ability to sync your collections, favorites, and custom quotes between devices is missing. Also missing are iCloud backups. If you delete the app and reinstall, all collections, favorites, and custom quotes are gone. The support team says these features are on the “roadmap,” but other features are higher priority right now. Very disappointing."
5,Zaki10000,Life is not smooth always but what a beautiful thing is to have such things around ( this app ). I was alone and no friends with no support. Got through a-lot and this application really helped me to get through tough times with its be quotes and i am really happy to be a user of this app. Whoever made this app.  May god bless you
4,2862Gunny,"So I set my time up from the time I wake up to the time I go to lunch and I have it on two motivational  speeches. This morning when I want to check I didn‘t get anything so I was like ""ok maybe not right now.“ so I checked at lunch and STILL haven‘t gotten anything so I waited a little bit and after lunch I STILL have NOT gotten anything! What is up with that is it a one time thing like I don‘t even know why I haven‘t gotten a notification yet today!"
4,Shayla R.,I love this app. Great for everyday use and I I’ve how inspirational and motivating it can be. The thing I really dislike is that if I don’t open the app every couple of weeks it stops sending me notifications. I don’t always have the time to open the app and just like to see the little reminders on my screen. Other then that 10/10 recommend this app.
5,Aradons2,"Full time caregiver here for my husband and 3 children under 16 of my own, the world feels very crazy at times. This app sends me a reminder as many times as I need a day  that it’s just the world and it is possible to stay centered and not let it all affect myself and my mental state/health! Huge thank you to the creators of this app!"
5,woody4777,"It will scare you how accurately timed and how perfect the quotes are, that come at the perfect time right when you need to feed your brain positivity. I was at my lowest of the week and was reminded of my favorite quote.  And this is for anyone who is dealing with hardships. “In the end, everything will be okay. If it’s not okay, then it’s not the end.” Much love , stay safe y’all"
5,Bmertens,"This app is PERFECTLY AWESOME!! This app isn’t like all those cheesy annoying and useless motivational apps. You choose how often you want a notification or “quote “ and select as many of their topics or areas or situations you may be currently dealing with; and they have TONS.   It’s very simple, very resourceful, very relatable, very user friendly and you cab always switch the topics up!!"
5,Jade Newsbery,"I was getting yelled at by my mom because she thinks I was under doing the cleaning. And I a notification from this app saying, It’s ok, you did your best. I was so relieved. It’s almost like they are watching me. This app is the best and I am going to download it on every phone or device I have. This app has the best advice and sayings, thank you"
5,Ashbee1626,"I’ll admit that I was skeptical about the app at first as I am with any app, but this one has so far, truly helped and inspired me to make everyday better. I suffer from anxiety and depression so most all days can be tough just to get out of bed at times. This app has helped me out a great bit with both of my depression and anxiety."
5,Serpent dragon 🐉,To be honest I thought this app was going to be kind of stupid. I saw an ad for it and thought it was just going to be some dumb app with uninspired quotes. But I wrong. The quotes are well written. The game is cute and inspirational. As someone who has struggled with mental illness this game just made me feel a little bit better and that’s all I can really ask.
5,ValeIS300,"I was at a very stagnant point in my life and that I needed a whole RESTART. I changed my everyday routine, invested my time in obtaining personal growth knowledge! With this car it brought me to here. I wanted not only to live my life in a more positive spectrum, but to physically see it. These quotes give me stability to proceed my day with the outmost fierce attitude. Thank you for helping me take the world by it’s balls, once day at a time."
5,Lyssisme,"I downloaded this app when I was going threw the roughest point in my life. I was drinking everyday after work. I’m a mother of 2, so I had no choice but to keep pushing. But this app, would send me reminders all throughout the day & I’d be lying if I said it didn’t help me out so much!! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been & I still have the app!!"
5,Auddrei,"I got recommended this app by someone. I saw some funny moments from them, for example a time when it said “It’s too late for you” to them which is kind of ominous. I did not expect though to be met by a quote saying “You can’t move forward.” Huh???? I may just be bugging tho lol. It was funny anyways so 5 stars."
1,JustTryinvg,"Not sure what is going on but I paid for this app becuase I loved what the free app offered and wanted more. Recently the app has stopped working. It doesn’t rotate the quotes as scheduled, I can’t move to the next quote on the app. The widget isn’t working. Most of the time when I click to save or share is stays on a white screen. I did the update and everything got worse. There is no way to contact anyone or report an issue. If the app is broke and not going to get fixed I would like a refund of at least a prorated one. Please fix."
5,Number1gat,"This app is amazing, it really helps me get through my day and it always pushes me to do the best I can. I love how it gives you quotes that you want to see for example I got a quote saying “individuality is so sexy” and I was like you know your so right. I recommend this app to anyone who needs help getting through tough times"
5,cool1too,"God bless the team that made this app. May your endeavors to help others’ happiness, motivation, and success be plentiful and fruitful. I hope this is motivation for you all. I hope this lights a fire in your stomachs and that you all know that what you’re doing IS making a difference! Keep it up! 💪🏾👍🏾💯"
1,ProfWhore,"I don’t know if it’s just because the developers thought it would be a good or helpful change, but the changes with the widgets has just made the app completely useless. It was nice to see motivational quotes randomly and when I opened my phone but now I have to open the app to try and inspire myself and it just doesn’t hit the same. Sad to have to delete the app because it’s helped through the years (but it’s only helped because of the widgets).  Not everything needs to be changed."
5,madison212002,"The app Motivation has gave me so much belief in myself, that it just feels like I have gained enough power to trust myself and believe in myself, and put my soul forward and it has really help me with my mental health Overall, this is a great app to help you make life improvements believe in yourself and put yourself forward always"
5,MD in the making,Best quote app hands down. Completely worth the subscription fee. The only drawback is that the app is not at all synchronized with your other devices. Meaning that none of your widgets or quotes you add to favorites will sync across devices. It´s a shame really because I use this app all the time on both my iPad and iPhone.
2,detanimulli,"Quotes customization is good on phones but they recently got rid of customizing the widget that feeds to your Apple Watch complication. Really was digging this app before as it was continuous feeding of my categorized quotes.   Now I may have Bruce lee quotes in my phone but then look down at my watch and see Marilyn Monroe quotes lol. Especially disappointing as a premium customer, I hope they fix this soon by adding the feature or those looking for a bit more personalizing will have to look for better alternatives."
3,lp.s,"They are both made by the same developer and seem to have the same content with slight different UIs. However, they each have their own subscription.  I actually bothered to subscribe to ""I am"" but now I have come across this app and would like to see what it has to offer. I am definitely not paying another subscription fee for the same content :/"
5,raeleanna,I love this because it is loving and I get reminders every daft and they make me not want to kill myself and make me love myself because I am fat and I don’t like it people bully me because of it and so I really like this app and I just go it and I already love it so please get this game and stop worrying and be happy and love yourself and don’t be like me and hate yourself like me just be happy and keep smiling
5,JuPFraz,Normally notifications can get on my nerves. But random pop ups of a inspirational quotes are so helpful and these always seem to pop up when I could use a lil nudge to keep truckin’. If you love Pinterest quotes and all that then this is definitely for you. “Someday it will all make sense” thanks phone.. one day it will. I’m making a joke but I’m serious at the same time.
5,Boythatisonehugewalicorn,"I recently started a new job, I’m engaged and planning a wedding, family life is crazy, I’m hard on myself quite frequently and that’s always hard to pull myself out of. This app seems to deliver just the right motivation at just the right times. The quotes are inspiring and I love receiving them every day. Great way for me to motivate myself. Love this app!!"
5,juangarrrcia,Motivation has helped me get through those very tough moments that most people go through a couple times in their lifetime. Those moments that last months maybe even a year or two to recover from.. Thank you for creating this needed app. It truly is a spirit lifter
4,Sulejmanovic,"I love this app. My friend showed it to me. I just wish that there was more categories for people who didn’t get premium. I understand that’s how you generally make the money of this app since it’s free, but I think for people who don’t want to spend money monthly, should have more options! Other than that, it’s okay! 😊 (By the way, I don’t want to spend my money on it because I think it’s a waste)"
2,A Pple uSer,"I love this apps it gives me all the quotes and things to make my day better but, I want to unlock sad quotes because sometimes I feel sad I feel even sader when you have to pay for just quotes you can look up so please make people who don’t wanna waste their money for more features pay money! I really wanna stop this cycle of apps and games have ing you to buy things you don’t need and leaves you out of the rest of the things. So please take this in consideration -11 year old Anivea"
5,prnxhjdkkdjd,This app has drastically changed my life.i never knew Waking up to positivity and before I go to sleep could change my prospective the way this app has. An especially through the tough days getting the reminders is the best thing that ever happened to me. This app is amazing
5,Soft Sweet Girl🦋,"I originally downloaded this after hearing about it from a friend, and now I adore this app. It’s extremely positive and having notifications throughout the day brings me so much joy. It’s the little things in life that matter, and this app is one of those little things I enjoy having in my life. :)"
5,EmileeHopps14,I’ve only had this on my phone for a day and already and it’s been well worth getting it! Love the quick motivation to take on each day and not just try and get through it but to try to make the best of it because we only get to live this today once🙂
5,strangeoddities345,"Wow. I can’t even begin to say how much this app helped me. When I first heard of it I was hesitant, and didn’t think it would provide much but I was so wrong. It’s so comforting to me and every quote has resonated deeply and gotten me through some serious anxiety just in the past week. Please do yourself a favour and download!!"
2,Jazzoml,"I’m most likely GOING to delete this app because every single time I click the notifications it gives me, an add immediately pops up and it’s so so aggravating. Like come on now I didn’t come to look at ads all the time, I came here to read affirmations. This app is getting me stressed out, and It’s doing the opposite of what it’s supposed to do. And the adds are literally so unnecessarily long!? I love the app “I am” way better than this one, that one doesn’t have stressful adds on it."
5,QuellaLeann31,"This app is great!! It gives you so many different perspectives on how to motivate yourself and stay positive. There's also many different subjects to choose from if you don't really need motivation. It can also help you deal with mental illness, inspiration, stress, social anxiety and more. I highly recommend it for individuals that don't have a lot of support in your life."
5,Dashy and Delilah,"Hi, I was scrolling through the App Store and saw this app, I was like.. “Wow. This is actually doesn’t look too bad, I could use this!” And when I download the app. First thing I get is THIS. “Do you want to get premium?” Really? I understand you have free features and all but... I think your app would be better off without Premium. :/"
5,spam_vedi,"This is the best motivational app that I've ever tried. There are infinite quotes and on top of that, you get up to 5 reminders for free everyday with a quote. There are tons of categories to choose from and you can customize the theme, don't, and background of all the quotes. BTW everything I said above is in the free version which is still a lot compared to other apps."
5,Justindnester1,"I look forward to these EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!!!! These give me so much inspiration and honestly, they are SPOT ON to what I need throughout the day. Just all around very happy with it!!! I haven’t even tried the premium yet!!! I, one thousand percent, time and time again, would recommend!!    Thanks for making my day brighter!!! ❤️"
4,Rdatg16,"I pay for this app. I see the quotes on my lock screen and take them as they come. You have to open the app to keep getting reminders which is Annoying.  I pay for it, it should continue to come without constantly having to open the app to say I still use it."
1,Weeks247,"I downloaded this for motivation not to talk me off a ledge. Every quote on here is depressing, they all assume you are struggling and not doing well. I set my preferences but it still shows nearly all relationship type things which I do not want or need. The quotes all contain things in past tense like “you aren’t failing, you’re progressing slowly” like what??? I’m looking for positivity and motivation not that! Instead it should be something like “Even slow progression is progression, keep moving forward!”."
5,VikEllen1,I’ve had this app for over a year and still love it. Motivation quotes are visible right from my iPhone screen by using the widget app. I pay for it every year. It’s visually clean and user friendly. Not a lot a options to confuse you but enough to customize the quote to your liking and aesthetic.
5,jane scaffer,I love this app and let me tell you why. So I normally have my days where I feel like everything is at it’s worse or even the tiniest thought in my head because I overthink a lot and i have many doubts But then out of nowhere I receive a quote on my phone and it helps me. Funny thing is the right quote comes at the right time and I love how it all falls in place.
4,Chuck:^*,"LOVE this app. I’ve added it as a widget so I can see my curated quotes each time I open my phone. I think an impactful addition to the experience would be a feature that lets you easily click on the quote’s author’s name that takes you to their bio or website. This feature would give context to quotes, giving them even more significance."
2,kfillips,"Purchased a year of this app and it was great for a few weeks.  Now the widgets won’t update and one is just black.  I’ve tried reinstalling the app, changing themes, everything I can think of.  I’m extremely disappointed because the updating widgets were my favorite part of the app because I would see a new quote nearly every time I opened my phone.  Now it’s been stuck on the same one for 3 days and the other is just a black screen.  Total waste of money!"
5,Lalkidu,"I have been using this app for a while now and it is very life changing, now I feel more confident of myself than I was before, whenever I don’t feel like doing anything or whenever I am really sad I take a few minutes to go to this app, when I am done, I feel motivated. This is the best app ever!"
5,Faviola C,"I’m not normally one to rate an app, but this one came to me when I was in a very sensitive place and I’d loved it ever since. It’s nice because you can set the time you want these “motivations” to come to you and how often, plus if you get the upgrades version (which is totally worth the money IMO) you can set the types of motivations you want! Highly recommend this app."
5,Mili sanchez,"I came here to tell all the people that are doubting in downloading this app, let me say this is the best app , I have ever downloaded , seriously it has helped me a lot, I feel like I get one of these when I’m feeling most vulnerable, their quotes are amazing , and even if you don’t pay you still get an amazing experience out of this , I definitely recommend!"
4,Awesome!!!!!'nnn,This is an amazing app. I love all the quotes and it’s very affective. There is only one thing that I suggest. I think you should be able to choose the quotes you have favorited also be a choice of what pops up instead of paying for it. I’m not hating on this I just feel people would like it better if they could read the quotes that they have favorited too as well as the general ones.
5,Momo ❤️,This app is really truly amazing. Sometimes you just need to hear (or in this case read) something positive. Sometimes it reflects something I’m going through ave it really truly helps. I’m glad I came across this app. I think this could honestly help people who may be depressed or thinking of suicide. Maybe even add a “you matter” category into the app
5,Jazzman102737,"This app is fantastic, however the option to have notifications for this app, does not show up in my settings on my phone and it’s severely frustrating. This app used to work as a scheduled notification. But now it doesn’t work. I will totally five star if this problem is fixed"
2,TiaTrimbur,"I like this. It helps me a lot with stress. But. I need uplifting quotes. I think you should have daily quotes. And that you don’t have to pay 💰 for things that aren’t considered “general”.  Everything is considered “general” since general means everything. I need some of them that are blocked. So, I might find a different app that lets me do this stuff since this app clearly isn’t helping one ☝️ bit. Hopefully you understand and will take my suggestions. You might start losing a lot of people having this app if they read this. Thanks!!!"
5,Crazycat1121,I enjoy waking up to these amazing quotes. They get me fired up each morning and I can’t wait to forward them on to my colleagues. Being able to set these quotes to pop up during the times of the day when I feel I need them most have helped me maintain my focus and push thru to my goals.   Thank you.
5,sibrena3,It is so easy to let bad things and situations drain your soul and having these motivations pop up throughout the day helps to bring me back to A better mind set. I work at a University and am planning to use various mediums to create artwork with the sayings that I feel would hit home for many of the students and hand them on the walls in my office.
5,MandyPlog,"I love this app, I love the quotes, I love the look, I love everything about it. Except sometimes the apple iPhone widgets quit working. And then they will start working again. I can’t seem to find any rhyme or reason to when they work or when they don’t. Any advice is appreciated!"
5,TamsHorn,"My personalized motivations that pop up really keep me going, especially through my hard days when I just need a little bit of encouragement here comes my motivation! I especially enjoy the ones that have my name in it. Thank you for everything."
5,Kesha-Loganville,"I love this app, and have been fortunate to know some of the authors on here. The content is meaningful and applicable everyday. It always few like they content is aligned with my daily motivational needs. I recommend this app to anyone that needs a little pick me up. It’s worth the small investment."
5,gnhfrbhhrf,This app is so amazing. I read a quote at the start of the day and one on at the end of the day. It brightens my day when I read one and totally recommend this app. I have been feeling a little down lately but this brought me back up. There are a few adds but doesn’t bother me at all. ❤️❤️❤️
1,Cloudy2525,"There seems to be a subscription for everything, and now including reading quotes on an app. That’s ridiculous. I used to love this app because it was nice and simple and offered motivational quotes, and now it forces you to pay $ each month just to see *specific* quotes or else you’ll get bombarded by ads. It’s disgusting. Remove the subscription model for this quote app; just because every other business forces us to pay for the simplest things, doesn’t mean you have to, too."
5,Chai109,"I love many of the quotes and look forward to them everyday.  However I don’t like the new backgrounds they are very dark in the scenery almost depressing. The app used to have beautiful bright sunny scenery and turquoise waters for backgrounds, and now that’s gone. Is there a way we can search online to get brighter scenery?  Thanks."
4,1tvhuk,So far I am enjoying that I don’t have to search endlessly for a motivational quote. I don’t like that I can’t move the text around on the graphic. That would be nice. Also it is bad to go back to the original before you’re done editing. And sometimes it just jumps to another quote and I not longer can find what I was working on.
5,Ms. Addielove,"Every since I’ve downloaded this app I’ve pass many quotes to family, friends, co-workers & people that has cross my path. Showing them you are not alone somewhere in this world another person is going through the same or similar situations. Keep faith and never let go"
5,-EVEQ-,"Thanks so much to the creators of this app, it help me so much with my anxiety and not only that but it help me achieve and get over stupidity things, I had in my heart, I would recommend it to anyone who don’t have or do have a grow up that would give them, real life advices. Thanks so much again 🙏"
1,TootieMayARNP,"I was beyond STOKED when I saw the ad for this app on IG. I thought, wow! This is really awesome and will help me push through to achieve my goals and become my happiest, best self. So imagine my shock, disappointment, and down right disgust when I found out this app comes, not only at a cost (fail) but, also that it’s a recurring cost. Something such as this should be absolutely free, especially in today’s world. The fact that this is an annual cost is what made me walk away altogether. I pity whomever was behind the decision. Just wrong in every way."
5,Unnamed Rater,This app has been very helpful with having motivation (during these times especially). I really appreciate that the categories that help with mental health are part of the free non-premium app. Many other motivation and meditation apps will make you pay for those. It shows that this team actually cares about their users’ wellbeing.
1,Arghhhhghhh,"Almost all of these “quotes” are written in poor English and seem like they were taken off the Tumblr page of a teenager from 2011. There is nothing motivational or encouraging about any of these fake-deep one-liners. And why on Earth would an app offer categories and then ignore them completely? ALL of my quotes were about relationships and “toxic people” - I asked for quotes about reaching goals and working out.  Instead of spending $20 a year on this garbage app, please just make a Pinterest quote board and get your angst-ridden grammatical errors for free."
4,Lyss😀,"I love the messages that  this app sends   me. The only issue I’ve seen is that for people who are visually impaired, it’s not always very accessible. At least in my experience with my screen reader, some of the buttons are just labeled with a random grouping of letters which doesn’t help me understand what the button does. Other than that I love the app"
5,OG DARKRANGER,This app has been great and i haven’t really had apps similar to this but this app has been great and i love the quotes and it is great!!  I do think it would be better if it weren’t for the prices. It is not cheap but it still is worth it in my opinion. If you are looking for an app like this this would probably be your best option!!  This app is amazing!!
5,Dornaheartsspiderman,"When you get a notification, the quotes are too long and get cut off, it would be a pleasure if the notifications were short so we could read it all instead of it ending like this … Thank you :)"
2,Tattoo mama 7,"Loved this app until recently. I purchased the full version because I loved it that much. Contacted app support because all I get when I open the app for the last few months is a black screen. The issue has not been resolved and it’s very disappointing. The app is up to date, my phone is up to date, so idk what the issue is, but feel that some kind of response or effort from the developer would be a start."
5,de3dskullz,This app helps me keep my thoughts positive and speaks more kindly to me than my own mind most times. It seems to always have the right message for just what I’m needing to hear at that moment. It’s helped me a lot and offers amazing affirmations and advice throughout my days & nights.
5,ello peoplez ;>,"This app is really motivational and inspirational. I’m going through a lot of sad stuff right now, and it has been helping me view the world differently. It also helps my mental health because of how motivational it is. This is definitely one of my favorite apps. If you’re reading this, I totally recommend this!!"
5,Edgar310,This app is helping me get through so many difficult tasks and rn it is currently 9:00 and I’m reading these quotes and they are really good so far I’ve gotten 1 add in the past 5 minutes which I don’t think is bad but i am really glad I downloaded it I hope you feel the same
5,techhoarder,I switched to this from an almost identical app with the same subscription price. However this one has many more features and is much more customizable. Love to see that they are keeping up with updates and adding new content.
5,tuhgghbf,"Just what I wanted, really motivating quotes that aren’t just phrases, that I used to see that puts more stress on you than motivation. The app is giving you a really nice working vibe right from the beginning. I’m not really used to make reviews on stuff, but this is something I would recommend to everyone."
5,Infiniteboy09,"I just love how many categories there is to adjust the quotes you get, and I love how you can add times and numbers of quotes, and how liking something affects the quotes you get. It is a great motivational app, and it gives me and I guess 600k people reasons to wake up in the morning."
5,QuesoDilla13,"This is the most important app on my phone now. I wanted something to replace the addictive phone scrolling. This is it, this helps me to remember to continue on the road I’m on. And not to focus on others “storyline”, because you have your own. It’s happening. Quote, “In the now.”"
5,Dalton Blaine,"Motivation has helped me focus, keep on the right track and share what I have learned with family and friends. It’s the best thing I have added to my life and I can’t believe I have gotten where I am without it. Now the sky is the limit and I can’t wait till I get another “Helping Hand”. God bless. Phil Tatum"
5,carefreed,"Really enjoyed using this app for a random motivation quote to lift my spirits, but that was before I started noticing some quotes that weren’t exactly, motivational. On more than one occasion I noticed quotes with a sort of... agenda that had nothing motivational about them. Great app if you don’t mind sifting through some quotes that aren’t remotely beneficial to your life. Just wasn’t for me."
5,motivationapprreview,"I love this app! I really enjoy getting to wake up to a nice motivational quote to start my day. I feel like it helps my mood, overall quality of my day, and thoughts. Also, they recently made it to where you can have ANY background with ANY font choice, which is awesome! They have so many choices! Overall, 5 stars! I definitely recommend this!"
5,shamelia_blueyy1,I’d beyond love this app no question but every since I’ve updated reset my device..it lost all my saved quotes🥲and I didn’t know the latest update you can know basically sign in with an email or whatever login method. I hope the app can give it back
5,painterk9,"I’ve been using this app over three years or four years now and I can tell you that is the best  ever give you so many Guinness when it comes to relationship friendship, family, and anything else that will help you with your personal life. Thanks again. Painterk9"
5,Yong528,I know with each of us having our own negative self talk. These seem to always pop up with the break time though I have not used a paid subscription. I appreciate that they continue to let me look at these. God Bless!
4,4th of July Queen,"I love this app because it cured my depression somehow and I also have the widget on the front of my screen and I love them my favorite quote is “don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened” and I just really love this app you should get it. The only thing I don’t like about it is it makes me pay for everything but other then that, it’s really good!"
5,  ,"I love that every time I look at my phone, there’s a new positive message waiting for me - great feature.  I am a premium member and find the cost well worth the product - as someone who tries to share positive messages through social media, I have loved this app ever since I discovered it."
4,StormnMK,"Like the quotes and wallpaper options.  Like the ability to save quotes that resonate.  However, as a premium subscriber, I find it entirely unacceptable for Motivational Quotes to fail to maintain my account data and still take my money.  The entirety of my history, favorites, etc. are gone.   Unacceptable and will not recommend nor renew subscription.  Be aware."
1,Addicted to this7656,"Specifically some of the saying regarding relationships, they were telling me to be single rather than be in a relationship if blah blah blah. Well I’m in a great relationship, I don’t need an app suggesting that my honey is bad or doesn’t treat me well.  What I want in a motivation app is positivity, love, encouragement, not something with a dark cloud hanging over the saying suggesting that there is something wrong in my life. I was looking for something that would inspire me or motivate me to be grateful about the great things that are in my life.   Sadly that is not this app."
5,sabir212,"I’m glad I downloaded this app and it is indeed worth the money because not only is this good for your mental health, but it is also extremely helpful in keeping a positive attitude and block all the negative bad news that comes my way. It’s worth it, good luck to you who ever is reading this. Stay hard!"
5,Jeffvat,Am having issues with the notification on my phone. How do I turn on reminder for this app on settings. It says enable notifications for the app. I can’t find it anywhere. Am a paid user and I can’t get any notification. The support team should help on getting these fixed.   Ps. Great app!
5,Wavy Wade ⚾️,"I really appreciate this app I was at a point in life where I wanted better so I started seeking more positivity whether it been on social media, my own family, etc and once I seen this app and downloaded it now it’s been a blessing and it really helps me keep moving forward it’s definitely worth it Monday- Friday from 8am- 10pm it’s a must 🤞🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾"
4,Girliplier,If i don’t go into the app for a while it stops the motivational quotes and i wish it wouldn’t. i don’t need to go into the app every day to see the quotes and have them be useful to me. especially since i pay for this app there should be no reason for it to stop sending me notifications. please have a solution to this.
5,LOLLI SULL,"I’ve gotten the app a couple minutes  ago because I have been worried during 2020, and the quote “whatever is worrying you right now, forget about it. Take a deep breath stay positive and know things will get better” This helped me a lot, you should definitely get it"
5,👩🏼❤️😊,I am going through a tough time right now and I really need a reminder to keep going and that every thing is going to be Okay. I feel like this app is helpful because you can set a certain time and how many quotes you want each day. So if your going through a rough time in your life you should get this because it really helps lift your spirets.
5,mystery person 2,I have been struggling with my sexuality and I have a crush and this app made me and my struggles so clear and made me start to love myself again when I thought I wouldn’t live another day.     This app made me feel so confident and gave me faith and hope and I love this app. Please download it. It will help a lot.
5,AlliHR67,"I have always been a lover of quotes. I used to highlight them in my books, listen for them in movies, and now wait patiently for good ones on Facebook. Now I can read one every day. Some I relate to more than others, but they all strike some chord in me. Thank you for this uplifting collection!"
2,eagle's I,I read 3 of the quotes and it makes sense that they were both so good and so well spoken that I I think I should be more of an advocate for the other side in this situation but I’m just saying I think the only way I could be a good advocate is to have the other person to help you and that is to be able and be a better person and be more supportive and be more respectful to the person who has a better chance at the future. 👍
1,AshleyDelavane,"Look, love this app. It is perfect. So why 1 star? Well the developers are ignoring anyone who says that they get white screens with barely legible quotes, when clicking on a notification. Every now and then with an update, this issue is solved. Only to come back with another update. If there was another app that came anywhere close, I would switch. Developers , please heed these comments from a paid customer. I am not the only who has this issue, there are thousands of others."
1,I’m in love with your mom 😘,This app is so stupid I thought I would help me with my depression because my boyfriend cheated on me with my mom 💔💔💔💔 Bit everyday it would say ( Your a disgusting mole rat you are a disgrace to every peace of trash 🗑️) I cried so much because of it and I didn’t do that to anyone like I have a friend named lilli who fell through a sink because you was singing ( I want to sleep with somebody I want to feel the heat with somebody yaaaaaa) and now she doesn’t have ptsd because of this app she is so happy she is still single but now she has 34 cats 🐈‍⬛ 🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛👎
2,MelissaH94,"No matter what category I choose, no matter how many times I dislike the quote, it only every shows me the SAME EXACT QUOTE. “Do more of what makes you happy.” I’m so irritated. I paid money and I’m beyond depressed. That being said, I understand that that particular quote is supposed to be motivating, but I can’t stand it anymore. It feels the same as when someone tells you “be happy!” when you’re sad. Like l…PLEASE just show me any other quote."
3,Ashlynette92,Would be a five star app but everytime i get my collections of quotes organized the app seems to delete everything. My likes and collections. And makes me start over. This glitch happened after months of enjoying the app. Then again after a couple of weeks. Scares me to use it now. Theres no way to save anything. A sign in or something would help.
5,OriginalMoonGoddess,"This app is absolutely amazing. I love it, it reminds me of my own strength… well more like it allows me to see it. Currently healing my PTSD from my time at the military, when I was in it I lost all my confidence and it truly changed my perspective about life. This app is just really good, I’m telling you. YOU NEED THIS! (: give it a try!"
5,Cheryl Teel,"This app advertises a free trial, okay. I used my cash appCard that had a few dollars on it. As soon as I put $20 on my card, this app steals it. I was not happy with the app, and plan on canceling my subscription before the trial ran out. Looking at their pageThey say that they do absolutely no refunds and it is up to me to request a refund from Apple."
1,MileHighSoto,"I am beyond disappointed because the widget no longer works. As corny as this sounds, this app would make my day go by with the right thing to say throughout the day. When I’d pick my phone up there was a new quote on the widget and then a string of notifications with more quotes. I paid for the subscription because I loved the app so much because of the widget. Now, there is no point. I will find another app who’s widget does work instead of a black square with lines through it and no words. 😠 Update: NO THE UPDATE DOESNT WORK. ITS STILL A BLACK SQUARE WIDGET"
5,sephonex,I started by downloading this just to get some motivational quotes to write on my calendar...3 months later my husband says this app has helped me just as much as my antidepressants in terms of staying positive during tough times. I can't thank this app enough for everything it is.
4,hdbdhehdhhd,"Hey, I’ve had this app for a while and I appreciate it. But I just don’t understand why I have to pay to be happy or get motivated. There should be a choose one topic for a session like you get to choose one premium session of motivation quotes and it can happen on a holiday or use a get out of jail free card. Just a suggestion but you should really consider it. Thanks -Jacob"
5,Ya boy Ant,"I do not even pay for the premium subscription or whatever, but this app is great at its base. It often sends me quotes that are just what I need to hear to change the mood of the day and/or have a little inspirational motivation. I likely will upgrade to the paid version, soon. Love this!"
5,claire45326733,This app my favorite app I have ever downloaded. I think anyone and everyone should download this app. It has helped me become a better person inside and out. I think if everyone read 5of these quotes the world would a better place. This app has helped me though some very hard times (2020). So I really live this app it has helped me.🙂
3,Anjelly25,"I love this app. I use to go online and  search for quotes and read them for hours. But with a busy schedule, I rarely do that anymore. Having quotes pop up on my screen through out the day brightens my mood. My only complaint is why do I have to keep adjusting the amount of reminders I’d like to receive? Just keep em coming until I turn it off.! Other than that, great app! Thanks ☺️✨"
1,volleyballgirl🏐🏐🏐🏐,"if you are struggling with anything: social anxiety, depression, loneliness, loving yourself, inner peace, moving on.... this BEAUTIFUL app has it ALL!!!!!! i set daily reminders so it sends me an inspiring quote notification 4 times a day, and it is to cleansing to just swipe through all the quotes.❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️🦋🦋🦋🦋☀️☀️☀️☀️🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏼‍♀️ recently a loved one has been feeling really sad so i let her look through the quotes in Motivation and also the I am app the same developers made and it seemed to help her. 😊 please download this app to make your life happier!!!!"
5,Mathgeek/bookworm,Love this app I just wish you could save the background images to your phone. That’s really the only reason I’m giving this a 4 star  Update: I am so grateful to the developers of the app they commented on my review and told me how to solve the problem I was having. Most app developers don’t do that so I’m definitely giving this a five star
5,Casey Nae,I really do enjoy this app. Some of the quotes seem to come at the exact time I need them. It’s great how well it relates to what I’m going through at the very moment. I do wish they had a way to go back because I have accidentally tapped the screen and lost quotes that I wanted to save. Overall it’s a great app!
5,mariscol,This app is very inspirational and gives me good advice! It’s very cool how you can improve what you need for free mostly. If you are having a hard day this app is great to come home to and look at!!! It gave hope when I thought that I was done hoping and giving faith! This app has brightened the future and so has God who probably lives the idea of this app! ❤️
5,TFrem,This app is a great motivational tool.  The fact you can customize the messages is great.  It has the uncanny ability to give you a lift when you need it.  I also like the fact that it has a widget for the Home Screen.  Highly recommended.
5,Litty Jovan,Helped me a lot tho my change in life helped me grow into a better person hope this app can change a lot of people on how they feel about there life or how it’s going things can get worse but don’t ever lose the spirit of faith/positivity
5,ErnShiff213,"I realized that when I think I’m doing my best, there is always something somehow someway that can remind me that I can search outside of Myself even more to relate and expand the mind understanding of being grateful. And this app helps me achieve the best that I can be. Thank you thank you…  Ernest Shifflet"
5,arikidk,Evertime I get my phone I see it and it makes me so happy that it’s in my phone and there and I feel like I been even better and it’s really a nice app y’all if your feeling down and about school I say you should download this app look threw and see that you like and click it and it improves you!!!!!💗💗💗💗
5,seun lee,"This app really thought me a lot, make me understand life lessons..give me sweet emotions over my down time bring me up from my tears , lift me up against my enemy, when ever i enter this app with sadness “am “ always happy after reading 📖 because it’s brings me to life again 😔😣"
2,i.mehal,"I started out with the free version and liked the app. I upgrade to the premium subscription because they added the category of Quran. I don’t know why in the latest update they decided to remove the Quran verses. I checked to see if they removed all religious texts, but no, only the Quran verses category was removed. I’m extremely disappointed and will not be renewing my subscription unless they bring the Quran verses back."
3,gonobeanoe,"The app is good and the Lock screen widget is really nice. But some quotes are kind of odd, and end up making my day worse than better.   For example, “A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory.” Felt very strange to read as I was waking up.  Now that you have a good app going please do some quality control before allowing quotes to reach users."
5,#IGACFV,Our charge nurse everyday reads us a quote. I didn’t think much of them at first but after a while we the nurses and the CNA’s were asking for them. These quotes wether you even think about them again throughout the shift or not they do make a bad day get better. It’s the thought process.
5,Ddbk,"This app has helped me tremendously throughout my days. Not even just for myself but also with friends and family. It’s that little whisper in your ear off encouragements or just knowing you’re on the right track! Great app, I’m happy I gave it a chance. 😃"
5,Loves nature .,"You are by leaps and bounds the BEST , MOST HELPFUL app in this category . I tell ALL my friends how great you are !!        The very first thing I do each day is to read everything I can on your app while I eat breakfast . I don’t know HOW ON EARTH. I would have gotten through these hard times without you !!!          Much gratitude and appreciation !!"
5,omglllllll,I got to say that this app has changed my life in so many ways and I wanna thank the maker for this app...I will be on the edge of suicide and I’ll go to the category I feeling and I’ll just read those quotes for hours and it makes me feel better about myself and what I am worth once again thank you to the makers of this app
5,EngProf1,"I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, major depressive disorder, and PTSD. This app, in addition to therapy, has helped me be more positive. I have messages set to pop up throughout the day and they help me keep going...truly motivational. I’ve been using the app for over a month and I can truly say it has been life changing. I highly recommend."
2,Jbsaylor,"I got this app looking for motivation because I was having a hard time even getting out of bed. I wasn’t looking for disappointment. But that’s exactly what I got. All the categories that I needed the most were ALL locked. You have to pay to unlock these categories, if you want to have everything unlocked, it’s $5 per month or $60 for life. This app is dumb. They claim it’s so motivating but it’s really not when you can’t even get what you came for. Don’t waste your time like I did."
5,drvid,"I have the app so a widget on my Home Screen has changing messages, as well as getting four different pop ups each day.   The quotes are very uplifting and positive, and always seem to be the one I need to hear right then.   One of my favorite apps I have on my phone and watch!"
5,lilMActeezykat,"This has quickly turn into my most frequently and anticipated to open, app that I have. I love that you can have different themes in the age of their own little music and the range of quotes from inspirational to self motivating to religious to humorous ECT. It’s just great I’m so thankful for this app it brings me peace."
5,KaitlinsWorld,"I’ve been using it for only a couple days and I have truly noticed a difference in the way I think when it comes down to it, the experience will be different for everyone though, keep in mind you can only get as much help as you allow."
5,Kwahlhomes,Your life will just be overall better more inspired strong spirited full of hope desire. It’ll help give you the drive and the focus and the reassurance that you are enough and everything that you have is within. Thank you to the creators. 💕
5,Keesha3k,Really good app so far it’s a very calm app I recommend :) it’s good for when you having a bad day or you don’t feel like yourself you could customize your theme and what you want to change about yourself and improve it. Whoever downloads this app I hope and wish you the best!
5,Illie0710,The ancestors must use this app to communicate with me! I swear whenever a quote pops up It’s just what I need to hear. I have an aesthetic on my phone so being able to change the background is perfect! This is my favorite app and a steal because I never purchase apps. Whoever created this amazing app…thank you!!
5,"the reciever of ""the gift""","I’m Going through a lot. To have app tell me every x amount of times (you choose) how awesome, how to grow, well just what I needed to hear usually. I do not go past the “free stuff” so just know I can’t speak beyond that, but they will usually say If o watch an add I can pick whatever like a background. That’s prob my fav thing ! Anyways good stuff lol"
5,Abdulzaire,"This application has helped me from the day I downloaded 2 weeks ago and I use it daily. My attitude towards myself, my family and the rest of the world has changed. I fall short some days and guess what, I didn’t look at the app. So it’s a continuous journey and I’m thankful for whoever made this. Thank you!                                Abdul"
5,oomar0005,"Sometimes i would feel left out, being alone, or feeling sad, but this app made me feel better! It made me feel like everything was alright in my life and that i don’t have to change a thing about myself! Thank u so much for everything! This app made me feel so happy, this was the best decision in my life! 🥺"
5,Victorkys,Don’t get anymore quotes per day ! It worked  for a few days  then the application don’t send you notifications anymore! Try to get help and they want pictures and examples and explanations!  So frustrated !
5,Slay it girly,This app teaches other kids like me that they are important and to always think good thoughts I hope other kids will enjoy this app. in a similar app with different quotes say I am sexy and attractive and I do not think that it would be appropriate for them to hear and that is my review for this app.
5,BurgerShack,"Ok idk how this app is doing it but it always seems to display exactly what I need to hear that day. I have pretty wild and intense mood swings, too, but this app keeps up. It’s almost creepy how well it keeps up.  Definitely worth the money bc it helps me keep healthy thoughts Front and Center throughout the day."
5,Katie Doane,"I never write reviews. This app is incredible in that it works even if you don’t have service! When you live alone on the road and your in a service vortex, but you get a ping with words of wisdom and support, priceless. Please never change this!"
5,blueclouds96,Motivation app has been very helpful. Especially when I struggle at times or just needing a sign of some sort it’s been great! There are days when I’m feeling sad or anxious or even happy and then I’ll look up any motivational quote that I’ll need to remind me to relax and look after myself.
5,J_ahlexis,"No matter your situation or what you’re going through this app will have just the right words to help you push forward. I’m very thankful I ran across this and whenever I need a boost or just some insight, I just go on and find just what I need to either motivate myself or get clarity. Definitely worth having."
2,adbden,"I’ll start by saying I like this app and the widget available on my Home Screen. But today I looked at the widget, which is now a dark gray instead of black. The black matched everything else I had set up on my phone. And now I’m thinking about deleting the app simply because the color is off, and because there are zero customization features available. Lost interest immediately and won’t return to this app if there aren’t more “improvements” coming soon."
5,BookNerd080712,"I swear this app reads minds! I can’t even count how many times I’ve received a quote about something that I was just struggling with. It is an awesome app, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone! It’s one of the best parts of my day to see which quotes I’m going to see. 5 Stars, 10 out of 10, 100%!"
5,catnerine.m,"Such an awesome app! Thank you so much for the awesome, positive, “just what I needed to hear!” App/motivation!!! Love that you can make it stand out to oneself w different themes and yet the themes are not so overwhelming w options, but rather has such an amazing selection! Thanks for the positivity & helping others feel better!"
4,Arinna17,The only thing I hate is that sometimes I have to open the app to reschedule reminders. I understand that that’s low effort but I look forward to reading the quotes but sometimes arent there because I forgot to open the app to reschedule the reminders. Sometimes I don’t get the reminder to “tap for new reminders” and I just go hours to days without new quotes. Just a thought.
5,Maryfoxcmp,"Ok, guys, I’m writing another rev. And this widget app isn’t choppy AT ALL! And y’all know how picky I am. But if you pay, you pay for the same thing. So don’t pay. I can adjust the texture of the widget and app and the quotes are really good. And that’s saying something because I suffer from Great Depression."
3,Marc198,Don’t get me wrong this is a great app it has a lot of amazing quotes but say if you want to change the font or customize what kind of quotes you want you would have to pay for those kinds of things and I think it’s ridiculous! It’s either $5 a month or you would have to spend $36 a year on this app!! Like I said there is room for improvements and I am very disappointed with this...
4,ReginaMirella,I am enjoying this app every morning. My favorite feature is one that allows me to create my own affirmations. The only reason I sm not giving it 5 stars is that it does not allow me to record my own voice for the affirmations and I do not like any of the ones I. The app as they all have an accent and all sound stilted to me.
5,olive2297,"I’ve used this app for about 2 years now, paid the 20 dollars, and now all of the sudden it stops showing them on my home screen, as well as claiming it can go on the new iOS Lock Screen? Some bugs that definitely need fixed."
5,misjustine,"I love this app. It seems whenever I need a little pick me up or a reminder to not be inside my head so much, I open the app and usually the first one the pops up tends to land right on the mark for me. And it gives me that little nudge to keep moving forward. Two thumbs up."
5,@AlfordShay,I have had this app for years and it has helped me tremendously through my depression and anxiety! I highly suggest subscribing to the yearly plan! It’s the best one I’ve found out there so far! Thank you for developing such a wonderful app for people that need to be reminded that there is light at the end of the tunnel!
4,VicioUsGiggles,"I love this app the quotes are amazing and i love the background choices.  I however have been having issues with getting amazing quotes that i want to save and when i go to favorite it or save it to my phone it disappears and the quote changes and i can’t find the one i wanted again.   This has happened at least 12 times to me now and I really wanted the one that i had selected today.   I just lost my mom and this quote was perfect because people who i thought cared about me have been nowhere to be seen. It said something like “Hard times show peoples true colors” i think, i really wanted to save it."
5,God's Grace is My Blessing,"I’m mot one to usually write reviews, but this deserves it!! The shift in your thinking when you repeatedly have positive messages being sent to you all day long, is priceless! It’s an amazing app and well worth the money for year long positive messages each and every day! :)"
5,Mr.2Good,This app is going to be the starting point of my break through! Going through so much in my life to find an app that have topics that relates to your life and help you put those things in perspective help change your way of being in the most positive way!
5,Windeagle71,This app shows ME a lot of positive IS STILL OUT THERE. In a world where we as humans in general are just trying to keep up. This app helps me get motivated if you will. It is an outstanding app especially for those who need the extra pat on the back just to let them know you are not alone
5,paypsy,"I enjoy getting motivational sayings so very much. If I’m having a bad day or just need a pick me up, one of them will pop up on my phone at the perfect time. They are really helpful for my mental stability.  Thank you so very much! These motivational sayings make my day much easier; it keeps me going!!  😃🙏"
5,:)PHORA,This app is good I like it it makes me feel strong and confident. It made good in the hard times. I am not a person that is telling you you have to download it now I’m just telling you that this app is really helpful for me and I think that you should give it a try I love this app I hope you like it if you download it. Thanks bye 🥀
4,LayBoogz,I absolutely LOVE this app. I paid for the yearly subscription. My only problem is that on this latest update the widget for iPhones is showing up completely black. You can’t read a word on the widget which is my preference. I have to open up the app in order to see the quotes. Can you guys please fix that feature? Other than that 5 stars hands down!
5,Hee Hes Master,"Hi!!! I really hope I could get some feedback on this. I suffer from a couple mental illnesses but I can’t pay for premium. I can never choose which one I want for quotes. Can you make it so that you can get like 2-3 of the topics together at once? I understand you need to make money, but I’m not allowed to pay for it."
3,BraceFaceKutie,Hmmm I loved this app but not so much now. I really really really loved this app in the beginning. The quotes were so original and motivational. I set my notifications to be motivated throughout the day. I would even send some of them to family and friends but lately whenever I see a quote I like in my notification screen and I go into the app it’s a totally different quote and no matter how much I look for it I can’t! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!
5,Arykca C,On my behalf. Uplifting and puts a smile on my face. Every quote that comes through seem as if it’s always right on time. Rather it’s a reminder of things you’ve heard already or a quote that makes you think and sometimes changes the trajectory in your life and/or spirit. Hope you enjoy the app as much as I do so far. Thank You❣️
3,Jimmy Nuutron,I know this app is made only for motivation but personally I think it can get boring eventually. Just like TikTok when you scroll on the for you page. I think they should add more variety in it because any app could do what this one does it’s just that there’s not that do it. I think they should add a section where you can post your own motivational messages or stories. 5/10 if I could
5,Joeybroo,"During my free trial I was getting the quotes all the time, and they were pretty good, nice reminders, little pieces of motivation etc. and then today I just realized I haven’t been getting any quotes at all I’m pretty sure since I paid for the year in full... soo that’s a lil shady idk what’s up with that."
4,gufupcotxjfitc,This really is a great app I love it but my only complaint is that you can’t have more than one category without purchasing premium. I suffer from a lot of stuff so I just want to be able to make a pack for me without it. Most apps that I try have this too but sometimes there is nothing you can do about it which in my case I can’t do anything.
5,alfalfakalada,I have emotional and mental ups and downs. I enjoy reading the quotes when I’m fine and it’s almost like I need them when I’m not. Some days I can’t just read the one quote that is sent I have to come to the app and read a boatload of them. I sometimes find myself sending them to people I know need them.
5,Molly2303,I’m LOVING this motivational app. The fact that you can customize your quotes and use them as screensavers is the best. As an iPhone user it’s hard to find the perfect quote app that can be used properly as a screensaver but this one I had no problems. I don’t even mind paying the 4 dollars a month for it. It’s completely worth it!!
2,gydhbdbjxnavskfnvgdjfb,"I use to have the older version and it would send me notifications for free. This new update is really a downgrade. Why do I have to pay for something that I originally got for free. I now sometimes forget about the app as a whole, where as before, I was able to get notifications of the quotes I initially downloaded the app for. I was able to get three notifications a day for free, but the new “update” wouldn’t even let me get one notification without pay. Come on now."
5,Mupsidedown,"There’s a saying that says “ But if your eyes are unhealthy,your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” I’m cautious what my eyes indulge in and i am very impressed by reading daily motivations has had a tremendous impact since day 1 I’ve downloaded this."
5,cupcakecruiser11,This app is amazing! It helps me with positivity and after my break up with my boyfriend. I got. Quote one day saying that I am learning how to let go of those I loved. I really want people to appreciate how good technology can be used instead of tiktok. Thank you developers!
1,PixieDreamer77,"I have been a subscriber since February 2023, but I can only love this app 6 days a week.  On the seventh day, I get the quote “Do more of what makes you happy” and that quote will stay no matter what I do to change it.  This happens on all of my devices.  The only way to reset it is to completely uninstall the app, reinstall, and go through the setup process all over again.  I’ve emailed the support team twice with no response or resolution.  I will not be renewing my subscription."
4,CEP8267,I am going through a very difficult time in life right now and this app has really helped me. I love how customizable it is even with the free version. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I wish there were more theme options in the free version. If you are looking for great quotes I highly recommend this app.
5,igros06,"best app for people with any type of goal—like fitness, empowerment, happiness, stress, self care, self improvement, depression, anxiety, mental health and even for people with disabilities and disorders. this app has helped me so much with my mental health and has helped change my mentality. you can set how often you would get a reminder and there are various categories to choose from. highly recommended. only con is that in order to access all the content you would have to subscribe but there is a free trial. people that don’t subscribe have limited access to all content"
5,rm3_2013,It makes me feel a lot better because I’m high school my friends left me but this gave me motivation to get up and keep going even without friends this thing motivated me to keep going witch is why you should try this out it will motivate you a lot
5,cookie 155650,This app I just got and I’m already feeling a lot more relaxed and feeling a lot better about myself should definitely get especially If you’re feeling stressed I have and I’m already feeling a lot better as I said before definitely should get!
5,DorkyGarfieldrocks,I got this app after I lost my best friend. It has helped me a lot. At first I kept trying to pull her back to becoming friends but then I learned sometimes you have to let go I am still ya sing trouble getting over her but I am learning. I would highly recommend This app
1,day mbxjgxlhxufzg,"basically that. Assuming you have an iPhone worth easily over 1k, $50 shouldnt be THAT much for the average user right? right guys? Especially since its for all these quotes I can just go on google and search up, why wouldn’t you go and drop hundreds of dollars into a sub for some quotes!?   Basically the same thing as, hey heres a tool to give you some reminders to pick yourself up every now and then, but we need 50 dollars. Yeah its a free app, but after that trial expires we’re gonna essentially lock your app to virtually uselessness."
5,DaBigBoi96,"The app is great m, my only issue is that you have to unlock your phone to read the longer quotes. If you could please change that would be awesome. No other problems."
5,vërråñįâ 😌❕♥️,Hi my name is Rannica an I am 14 and discovered this app when I was 13 because someone on my Snapchat has it and I liked the quotes they had post so I downloaded this app and I really enjoy using it and I love it 🥰. I made some quotes and I only did that because y’all quotes motivate me thanks 🙏🏽 for this app.
5,James Gails,"Ok this is really helpful for me like every morning getting motivation to get up and go to school is so CRUCIAL. Funny thing is, I just missed the bus but now I have confidence and motivation to actually try harder. To want to be better, so now I’m going to give myself a small routine to do daily that’ll better me as a person. THANKS ! 😁🥳"
5,CharlieMT1018,"I love this app! It makes me feel more comfortable with myself and the future than I was. The thing that I would want this to approve though is the paying. You have to almost pay for anything and people don’t have time for it. But, other than that i Love the app."
4,Lilybean18,This is a very well put together app. You will probably think the same if you get it too. But all things must come to an end. You have to pay for a lot of the features. I especially don’t like that you have to pay for  to see your favorites.
3,_reid_,"I love this app, and I have been using it for quite sometime now and I used to be able to get 3 quotes a day which wasn't that many and I wish I could've had more, but now I only get one a day. I'm a student and I don't have extra money laying around to be able to pay for these features which I feel should be free. I hope in the future I can get more than one quote a day."
5,Epunie,"I like this app and the quotes. Lately when the notifications come up on my lock screen or banner, I click on it to see more. Nothing shows on the app but the background. The menu and everything thing is frozen."
4,Miakvaughan,"I love this app so much. I have a trouble getting up in the morning and looking on the bright side of things and this app helps me with both of those things.  I also learn more about myself with this app cause i’m likely more motivated to do stuff, like walk my dog, and hangout with friends on the weekends. But overall this app helps me be confident and not let people interfere with my happiness.  Good app!!"
5,BAAAAAAZZZZZIIIINNNGGGAAA,"Downloaded this app to fill a space on my phone with a little positivity. It is actually GIVING me motivation, and helping me through this stressful time in my life. I am going through some of life’s worst changes, and this app is helping me through so much. Thank you ❤️"
5,NellNTed,Obsessed with this app daily. It’s always giving me the best quotes and making the most sense. Love that we can share the quotes to other social media websites and to text messages. Based on our mood it’ll choose the quotes so it fits perfectly with our days.
5,Lady D grateful,These affirmations are positive and uplifting to me .  They allowed us to feel better about ourselves and motivate us to do better. It shows that God is forever present in your heart and mind. They make you feel good about everything and give you the confidence you need
5,Laya1235689,It been like one day and I feel a little bit better like how!? Anyway I would definitely recommend this if you’re interested in it I saw just go for it. The ads for this aren’t a scam. I mean you would expect it to be a scam but it’s not!
5,DVOL08,I’ve been using these quotes for over a year. It’s well worth it. I really enjoy the different quotes I get and the timeliness of them most of the time I really feel they’re really talking right to my heart. I’m glad that I have the subscription I will renew again.  Thank you!
3,Miss D. LeShe,I’m not getting my daily notifications and when I go into the app it’s a white screen with icons at the bottom that don’t work. Please fix those bugs and update app so I can start getting my notifications again. I’ve been a user for years now and love the uplifting motivational quotes i receive to get me through the day.
5,julydreams21,I open this app every morning after my Bible reading time and I love all the positive quotes! This app is really really great and I just love all the quotes to get me through my day! I wish premium was free though. That’s my only wish but other than that I absolutely ADORE this app!!!!!
5,Mgdorris,"This is by far my FAVORITE app. I have the widgets on my Home Screen so I constantly see motivational quotes every time I open my phone. All of the quotes hit home! I feel motivated and reading these everyday puts my mind in a much better spot. I ended up paying for the annual subscription, trust me, it’s worth it!!"
5,btaylor187,I swear this app has and it still is helping me every day. It’s like it knows me. If I’m hurt because of a relationship it will randomly text me a quote about break ups. And it always tells me exactly what I wanna hear so I highly recommend this and you definitely need this in your life especially as a Widget!
5,sdnfspdfjejpaPkbwefip,This app somehow knows exactly what to say when I need it the most tbh. When I’m having a bad day it says something relevant to destress.  When I’m having relationship problems it will say something about relationships or self worth. When I’m depressed it will lift my spirits. Love this app. Keeps me going.
5,alisaklinke21,I just found this app a couple of days ago and I absolutely LOVE IT! it’s much easier to look at a humongous collection of quotes than to just keep on downloading them from the internet and having it take up storage. I absolutely have no things to complain about and I 100% recommend this app to people
5,stitchlover2000,I absolutely love this app! Even with the one day it made me wake up and want to just start running! The only problem I have with it is the ads. I continuously keep having the same add pop up! I have to completely exit the app and go back in☹️ can the developers try and fix this?
5,It wqs great....,This app is amazing I have no problems with it and I think everyone should get it! There are so many options to choose from but one thing I wish was different was that you didn’t have to pay for premium but other than that it’s awesome! Highly recommended!🌺
1,antoinette5000,"I enjoyed this app for years when it would send me quotes from notable authors and philosophers, with a few quotes about life and circumstance.   Now, it’s been popularized to include shallow relationship advice and I receive quotes from people I don’t even respect, such as Angelina Jolie or Drake or quotes from Harry Potter. And surely there’s a better variety of Black philosophers and authors to choose from. I am an author and I can’t even get the people who make this app to respond to my inquiries for how to have my work featured here. Surely if Drake can be “motivational” I certainly can."
5,Ava Michelle ❤️❤️❤️,"So I just got this and I LOVE it!!! It can help me out with my anxiety and to know that I’m thankful to be well and happy! I LOVE THIS SO MUCHH this is such an amazing app and I’m definitely keeping it! Although I don’t like how you get to pay money for it though, I don’t like that part but it won’t bother me anyways, I’m very glad I found this app, I need it right now. ❤️"
5,yareli/ eli,This app is a great app because it helps you in any type of situation you are in and motivates you and it helps you in life! I love how you can choose widgets for your screen as well! This app is great for people who need it or people in general! Totally recommend!
5,rully_rich,I’ve been trying to install the motivation app on my Apple Watch but it’s not working but when I check it say it’s compatible with this watch but it’s not working  My watch version is 8.8 but it’s still not working
1,czorvikw,"Cancellation is challenging. I tried to cancel prior to the 3-day trial period, but was denied because the small print at the bottom of the cancellation said it requires 24 hours’ notice. That is rare, thus I wasn’t anticipating it; and it was only stated at the point of cancellation, thus notice was not given. Now I’m in an endless loop with the app and Apple Support giving error messages about cancellation, so have been charged the annual fee. It is NOT WORTH being tricked into an annual subscription. Don’t do it."
5,reblbutrfli23,I absolutely love this app. It is my most favorite app on my phone and I actually go to this app every day 67 maybe even 10 times a day and I share the quotes with my friends my family!!! The app… it’s worth…it I love it…if I could give it 1 trillion stars that’s what I would do!!!!!!!
3,mks1711,I cannot seem to get it to consistently perform “reminders”. I have been through the settings over and over. Everything is setup correctly. One reminder/pop-up quote every day at 9 am. I get maybe one a week. It’s not rocket science. The funny thing is that it used to work just fine. But not anymore. I will not be renewing this subscription.
1,kjozz_itunes,"Subscription only….pass for me….apps are not magazines….  Update, reply to developer response: after this response, if I could give zero stars, I would. Why? I don’t buy the response grading content, and the app is a lot of work which justifies a subscription model. Take video games they take an extreme amount of work however, the base games one single cost yes they have content packs that you can purchase, but they’re not a subscription.  Let’s be real creating an app and Contant hasn’t changed what’s changed is quite frankly people are getting greedy  And one final example of a game, and quite frankly one that should be emulated is no man’s sky single cost for the game since it came out over 10 update add a new content and not a single one has require any additional payment"
5,ur mommmm >:),"i honestly love this app . it helped me realize so many things I wasn’t so sure about before. it better you in self care , even relationship advice if that’s needed for you . it has everything. 10/10 recommend must download ."
4,steffpbody,I love this app so much.  I use it to inspire myself and also to find inspiration for my team.  One of the things I loved most about it was the ability to customize the widget to look how you want!  After the last update the widgets are only black and white.  Please fix. Thank you!!!!
5,Christina.SCF,I set this on my iPhone screen as a widget so I have new uplifting quotes every time I look at my phone. Then I got an Apple Watch and now get quotes on my wrist during the day. I live it so much I but the premium subscription. I believe you need to put good things into your brain.
5,cyrjay,I really love this app. Makes my day so much better. But I am so confused of why I don’t receive  pop ups on my Home Screen anymore like when i first became a premium subscriber. Can you please clearly explain why and how I can get that back going? I’m not very tech savvy. Thank you!
5,not on nameless,When I feel hurt or feeling like doing something I read one of there quotes and it calms me down and I feel happy for once in my life  again I recommend this app it’s really cool and I love it! I have nothing bad to say about it just good stuff I can’t put into words how safe and happy it makes me feel!
5,KellyCoCoButter,"I recommend this to everyone I know and post it on my social media’s for others. This app has helped me get out of bed and get things done , starting the day off with positivity. It helped my Friends as well. I have a motivational speech at school and I recommend this app in it."
5,eddie.felton,I am Healing from a very dramatic experience and opening up my phone and this widget being the first thing that I see sets the tone for my healing process and it keeps me focus... If you are looking for a tool to help you through a rough time in your life I highly suggest this app to you...
5,jethroburgess,"Everybody wants to be cool but not everyone knows cool quotes. Why don’t you know motivational quotes? Cus you’re reading reviews for an app you should already have downloaded. Get your life together, get this app. Find out just how much you are missing out on because you don’t own the pro version."
5,Kcee5,I was at work and having a tough time mentally thinking about this guy and how I wanted him to text me and yadda yadda and then I looked at my watch because I thought it was him and it was a one of these inspirational quote things and it helped me feel better in that very moment.
5,Nick Majeed,"I am very frustrated with this app , I am trying to cancel subscription but no luck . They have made it to hard to cancel. Every time I go to my subscription page there is no option to cancel it so I am being charged $3.99 a month for no reason at all. It is a trap."
5,L'anana,"I struggle during my everyday life with depression and keeping a positive mindset, so this app is immensely helpful to keep my thought on the right track. I've only had 'Motivation' for three days, and without finishing the free 7 day trial I went ahead and purchased it because I didn't want the quotes to stop coming. >~< So worth it!"
5,Dtgfghhhhh,I absolutely love this app! I never post reviews but this app was too good for me not too. It’s nice to get a positive reminder every once in a while or to wake up to a quote about being confident to start your day. You can get premium but I don’t think that it nessasary for the app to still be amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone!!!
5,Very Motivative,"This app deserves to be left with extremely happy and positive reviews! Every single thing in it is perfect from being able to make your own quotes to be able to see everybody else’s and be happy every day, this is a blessing and it just keeps passing on, Thank you for this wonderful app"
5,Naomi Diaz Ramirez,I love ur app so much because the first “ really made my day but what I don’t really like is that u have to pay and I’m only 10 and my parents won’t want to pay because we’re really low on money but not so much because thank god we can pay rent 😊 💕✨
4,McMackley,"This is a great app with much inspiring quotes, definitely something that would lift someone’s spirits during the day. Some of the quotes are straightforward, some you have to think about for a while. I sent one to my daughter (9yrs old) who didn’t quite understand. Maybe some quotes are not as suitable for kids as much as for adults, but overall, it is a great app!"
4,Filipebone,"I like this app and it has helped me find motivation throughout the day. However, sometimes it can send some toxic messages, in which it makes people around you sound like villains without any self-reflection. My advice is to take everything it shows with a grain of salt."
4,DTW456,"The app itself is very welcoming and generally a good product, only problem is the fact that you need to pay for it, and depending on if a teenager or someone struggling with money wants to use this app, they won’t be able to get all they want, still a good app in general though."
5,AvusMFW,"I’m going through a very challenging time in my life and this app gives me inspiration, hope and sometimes even a smile with its quotes throughout the day. It’s almost like it’s reading my mind and sending me what I need to hear.  It’s really worth downloading to get signed up."
5,bxby_xiara,this app helped me with my mental health and just helping me focus on myself and growing as a person and I also tell my friends to try it to find themselves and just if they need some motivation they can read these but I’m so glad I found this app
5,mcmurtrey5,"This app helps me through some of the toughest times! It’s so weird because it will pop up a notification right when I’m going through, or talking about something, and it give the most PERFECT advice for that moment almost every single time! ♥️"
4,Katie.y816,"I like this app to give me a small boost in my day, but I came upon a statement that I don't think should be on this app or any statements like it. It said, ""Excuses don't burn calories"", I don't personally deal with disorded eating but I know it's a very widespread issue. These types of statements can be very harmful which is obviously the oppossite objective of this app."
5,Chrisy Ann,"This app has helped me in recovery of Depression. I suffer from MDD, and having positive quotes is a daily part of my life. I share the quotes from this app to my page on Facebook, it’s called Stay Strong Everything Is Going To Be Okay. My followers love the positive vibe of the app and have found it so useful. I can’t wait to see how big this app grows."
5,PRTDCS98,I never right app reviews. In fact. This is my first one. This app is just amazing especially with IOS14 when utilizing it as a widget. The quotes are a great selection and I think the best part is picking topics for the quotes. If I had to make one suggestion i would say that the developers should expand the quote library so I don’t see repeats.
5,Brett3272,"I’ve never turned notifications on for an app but this is one where you will and won’t regret it. I’ve only had it a few hours and it’s already helped me so much. Whether you’re feeling down, or unmotivated this will lift you up! If you have depression or anxiety I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this app!"
5,christianlambert,"This app is amazing, if your every feeling bad or just need some motivation just open this app and read some, and you don't have to pay! There is a premium edition but all that really does is unlock all the themes but if u want to unlock a theme when ur using it u just have to watch an ad so u don't really need to get premium. THIS IS AN AWESOME APP, ITS A MUST GET APP 🤗😘😍😀👌🏻😀👍🏻😮😏😎😗"
5,PH8NTOM_R0SEK1LL,This is such a amazing app it really does help me through all the hard times it helps me see better in the world it helps me see light in my light it is truly amazing and I give it 5 star because that’s what it deserves it’s very amazing and helps me a lot maybe it’ll help you too
5,mausiee,"So somehow this app knows when and what exactly to say when I’m down or the situations I put myself in, recently not that anyone cares I’ve been in a tough place for bit it’s really nice to get these notifications 10/10 would recommend :)"
5,Ball is life 30 11,This app came across me for a reason because I felt loss entering the real world and I struggle to grow up. We all feel alone and empty sometimes feelings misguided. This app has a true meaning to me to set reminders about how to go about my day.
3,jsaiv,"Everything is locked and you have to pay for it which means if you’re struggling with bullying, And just a bunch of other things and you’ve got this to get through your problems with that you can’t. It’s really disappointing because I want to help with certain things that I can’t get access to without paying. It’s whatever though. What they’re trying to do though is a good thing."
4,maybe ba a na,So I love this game I had awesome quotes for each day you can even set reminders for the game and without that i would have forgotten about the game😁  You can change the themes of the backgrounds but the thing that I do not like about that is that you have to buy most of them their is only like 4 that you can not unlock.🙁  But over all this is a pretty awesome app 😁😀😃😁😆😊
2,welzifc,For something like this you would expect it to be free because messages like this are made to build someone up. Using this to get people to pay money to you for something as simple as quotes is outrageous. Had the app for about 2 minutes before realizing every category was locked and I couldn’t change the number of messages I got a day without paying you. As soon as I realized this was all about the money and not helping people I deleted the app.
5,Busybeebierman,I have been using this app for a couple of years. This has been a life saver for me. I live with depression and PTSD so this app helps me stay grounded and have more choices how I deal with my thoughts and moods. Worth the price if they had a lifetime membership I would definitely considerate it.
5,Mattrace7,"great app positive motive all day and rlly does help me through out the day and keeps my head up. Never again do i rlly feel down on myself, because i can just lift my phone and see the motivation right there on my lockscreen. Great app"
1,LIL PILOT,This app literally made my days just that much better. From the daily quotes to a quote i would always think about and add. Then about a week ago it started coming up with this “debug” message. I ignored it at first only for a few days ago all my favorite quotes that i had saved to the quotes I had logged in it disappeared. What happened? This app as I said made my days just that much better but now im thinking about deleting it and just finding a new one.
3,Zoetry 🌏,"This is an amazing app and all but 30 DOLLARS FOR QUOTES? That’s just to much like lower it down. People actually need quotes to cheer them up and give them happiness, confidence, control, and more+ and you gonna make the quotes cost money? It’s actually quite messed up… I know I can easily search it up but this application is much more quicker.  Please lower the cash or at least get rid of it."
5,Savreion17,I read these everyday and they help remind me  the person I wanna be and how to work on myself and love myself and not caring what about people think about me and to get my money up and it’s a very great app if your dealing with depression or stress I 100% recommend it❤️
1,Bob 7811,"This app would be cool, if it was free. But there is no free version, it immediately asked me for money. The quotes are basic public information quote, and not even that inspiring. I can just Google a quote when I want to feel inspired, find better ones and not pay any money. I feel to see why this app has such great reviews, I’d prefer to use my money for things that are actually a value that can’t be provided elsewhere for free."
5,Kjdagoat241,"This app helps me everyday. Whenever i’m feeling down or need a little motivation I can always come to this and it’s like a spark has lit in me. This app encourages me to push harder and meet my goals. Would be nice to have a couple more free topics, but overall amazing app, very happy."
5,Łâmÿ,This app is amazing and it’s so inspiring and motivational! I added a widget on my phone so every time I open my phone I get amazing motivation. I definitely recommend this if your struggling with confidence and even if you just want it for fun!  I love this app so much. 10/10 recommend!! <3
4,Kahhlaaaaa,"This app is completely customizable, which I love. I don’t have any complaints other than the price to subscribe for a lifetime ($100) is a little much for an app. Reddit, Apollo, and other apps aren’t nearly that price. Wish it would come down in price just a little. Other than that, it’s been enjoyable."
5,Madelynne ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),"I absolutely love this! I am suffering from depression, and I never speak up for myself. I get bullied, and rarely talk. This app helps me reduce my stress and helps me to calm down in different situations, but this app is also fun! It has widgets, I love them! Thank you so much for creating this wonderful app that helps me stay calm, you are life changing."
5,Tdawgsed,I really like having the quotes on the widget. Makes sure i start my day off with purpose.  and keeps me motivated when i need it.  Contacted team about a feature request and got a quick response and saw the feature implemented in an amazingly short time frame. A+
5,baby.katherineee,this app is honestly amazing . the quotes are so inspiring 😘. i love this app . this really helps me go on with my day . it makes my day ! there is no issues with it . & this isn’t one of those apps that you have to forcefully pay to use . this app lets you get quotes without paying ANYTHING ! it’s amazing . 5 stars ! highly recommended 🤩.
5,jeessikkaa,Thanks for the motivation! I definitely recommend this app. I looked forward to every notification from this app because it felt like my own personal cheer leader. You can like quotes as you go and set timers to when you would like a notification. Definitely a Must try !
5,Auberon Auberon,I get these motivational notifications throughout the day via my Apple Watch and they’re so nice. All of them have a different message and they lift my spirits no matter what’s going on! Will definitely keep using the free version ❤️Recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,Love&Travel,"I can no longer swipe through more than 2 quotes without becoming trapped in a lengthy series of mind numbing ads that completely contradict the purpose of this app. I have loved both this and the sister app, I Am. But this new level of advertising is not inspiring me to begin paying. I am inspired to pay for apps that offer quality and work so well that they earn my money. This inundation of ads is backfiring and making me want to quit both apps."
5,Dynasty-Rose,These motivational quotes have helped my healing process from childhood trauma & adult trauma.. By seeing the messages everyday encourages & motivates me to keep going that no matter what we go through the storm doesn’t last forever.. I’m finally seeing the sun..
5,I-am_not-a_bot1283,This app is amazing it is as if TikTok was always nice and trying to make you a better person when you’re on it. Whenever I’m having a bad day I just look at this app and boom I feel a little bit better instantly
5,3walkers,I love getting the notifications of a new motivational message!  I will say it is just a little frustrating when there is an update and you have to go in and reset your notifications again.  But I. An deal with that!!
5,mary_claire,This app is so powerful! I absolutely love it. I use it every day. I love that you can change the category of quotes to fit your mood. These positive affirmations can be mood changing. I cannot recommend this app enough! It is WORTH your time and investment.
4,ejeuyttihesiteityeiuttiueieeiy,"I cant use this app alot because everything is locked. You have to pay 20$ a year or 1$ a month but since i’m so young I cant do that and my mom won’t either.  Anyway this app is great! The quotes are inspirational, motivational, helpful and I think it would help me with my depression. :) Too bad I gotta pay-"
4,Frogs2001,"This app is great especially when you really just need a little “pick me up” or motivation. Although I love it, I recently deleted it as more and more options became locked, ones that were free before now aren’t. Just don’t think it’s worth having unless you buy the premium."
5,natejr1203,"I love the way this app gets me in good spirits! As a believer, I usually have the time to go through a devotional or just read and study over scripture but the little extra boost through confidence and encouragement that this app gives is a joy!"
5,KingKeviie2021,"This app helps me get through my day with quotes that are so relatable to what I am going through .Not only does the app remind me more times than one ,but it’s always on point when I need a kick from feeling down or out of tune with the world .I Love Motivation ."
5,29936savage,"This app is on point and on time. It has it where you are sent several messages throughout the day. I recently experienced some heartbreak and challenges. Every time I found myself falling into a negative thought, there was a positive message to counter it. Thanks to whom this may concern!!"
1,Baby Ho Momma,"I downloaded this app because I thought it was pretty cool. I’ve had some hard times and to have some inspirational quotes would have helped. When I was setting it up, I saw that there was a monthly fee so I basically deleted the app right away. This was at the end of December. And now looking at my phone bill, I have a $9.99 fee. I never agreed to paying for this and it’s now one two of my bills. I don’t see any option of stopping it and I’m afraid of downloading it again to see if there’s any option there."
4,kenzie •3•,"However, I do think that everything should be free. I know it’s a low price, but if the price is that low, then why do you even have to pay anyway?! And yea. Overall this app is inspiring and it has a lot of topics that can help you with any situation. I recommend if you do need the help. But just.. stop charging people..."
5,Alyhaysapot,I love the app overall because it helps for your well being and your soul to make life easier and release positivity. It will change the way you think of your daily life from your situations to your evaluation of everything that goes on. I encourage you to get this app for the sake of yourself.
3,Savvy.Gamer2673,I am scared. Corona and a death in the family have been constantly making me stare at the ceiling unable to sleep. I got this app for motivation. I got some but they Jeep advertising premium and I can barely get the type of things I need to hear because I have to pay for it. I’m crying sad and alone. I need something to boost my spirit. But these ads aren’t helpful so I guess I’ll cry myself to sleep at night.
4,🍓🍌🍓🍌,"This app is super cute and I love it, it honestly really helps because of how many good quotes they have. The only bad thing is literally every category of the type of quotes you can have are locked :/ the only option is “general” and they have specific quotes for specific things but again they’re all locked. Other than that the app is pretty good"
5,kit sally,I was getting one motivation message are day. But then they start sending me several. It’s a reminder for me to keep on going and not forget my dream. It is best when the messages are early in the morning because it makes my day to know what I working hard towards
5,Rusty Cann,This app is a forward step in the evolution of my personal being! It provides me with the guidance to higher thinking on so many fronts that it has become a habit of the highest order. Sharing screen shots to loved ones is a regular event. The effects are deep and long lasting.....thank you and keep it coming!!!
5,Bella Hunter 22,"This is an incredible must have app! The customization features are 10/10. The user friendliness is stellar. The widget feature is just what you need for your daily, hourly, or minute nudge of encouragement. It’s also great for when you don’t know what to write for an IG caption."
2,lumpycushy,Idk what happened but all of the sudden now the ads have an annoying voiceover on them and idk how to turn it off. I’ve had this app since 2022 and I’ve never dealt with this before. I thought I turned it off but the ads AND the quotes are still being read out loud.   Please have an easier way to disable this because I am seriously considering uninstalling this app
5,SmileWithAY,I write these quotes on a board in my office and always receive compliments on them. The best when connected to your watch and they pop up to help you during your day. 10/10 highly recommend
5,kpolydore,"Since reading the quotes on this app, some of them come at the exact perfect time for me. Also, my friends have said that these quotes has helped them through dark points in their lives. Very happy with this app!"
5,raylormade2824,"I was looking for something that I can use to help me not only with my anxiety, stress and depression but also something that can help me be motivated, inspired and get me through hard times and moments. And I chose this app over another app. So I like this one a lot more."
4,哦审判员,"I've already subscribed to an annual membership, but as I continue scrolling, I still encounter pop-up ads recommending downloading related apps, which kind of affects my mood. Originally, I was looking at quotes because I was feeling down, and I hope these pop-ups can be canceled."
5,Kerzy1234,Can give you a little hope when you need it. Reminds you to be better then you were yesterday. I gave it a 4 star because some things I don’t agree with but most quotes I fully agree with.
5,jayla<\3,"It honestly helped me with things that i was going through and i got through it so i’m really happy about that,and i recommend this app because you can personalize what you want it to say or what you need to read or listen to."
5,MilkMarieMe,Great up if you need those little messages to pop at the right time to up lift your spirit. I enjoy how can pick what category depending on the mood you are filling each day. I highly recommend. To see who quoted each message a great gesture as well.
5,HoldenKiwi,"I love this app because whenever I’m having a bad day or I’m stressing about something, a quote always pops up that makes me think and help me calm down. I struggle a lot with many different things and it’s nice to have something I can turn too."
1,Sandylh1976,"There’s a bug or something and the quotes are not changing on the Apple Watch, I updated the app and uninstalled and reinstalled on the watch and still not working. Soon as this is fixed I’ll go back to five. Have a paid subscription as well. Update: developer responded that it was working now. Not true, tried everything already and it’s not changing on the watch. Tired of seeing the same frase everyday!  Not renewing my subscription."
5,Dawn Derrill,"The Motivational quotes and sayings really are a blessing because they get you to thinking, responding, reimplementing and moving forward with the various things that you face in your life with the ease and reassurance that you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you and that you are fearfully and wonderfully made"
5,Zombieunicorn53,"this app is amazing. i’m not sure how, but it knows what i need to hear when i need to hear it. i got an unpleasant text this morning, and i was going to complain about it, and motivation said “maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses in your life”  amazing. it’s helped me so much"
5,reflectly app user,I got this app not expecting much. I’ve been feeling anxious lately and thought it would be a good idea to use this. I’m not the type of person that likes notifications popping up but with this app you have control over that and I find myself smiling at all the quotes that pop up. Love it!
5,KitKat loves Monkeys 🐒🐒🐒,I love this app because sometimes when I am down and do not feel my best a look at a quote and that makes me feel better. Especially in this time we need to be remembered that we will get through the darkness and get to the light. Thanks so much for making me remember I will be alright.
5,Lalala idk,"It seemed kind of corny, but I downloaded this app when I was in a dark place, and these simple sometimes silly little reminders seem to pop up on my phone right when I need them to give me some perspective. It’s important to keep positivity flowing throughout the day and it helps"
5,Puppy Pawz,I love this app sooo much because I sometimes I am really doubtful about myself. I post a ton of the quotes on Instagram. I love to send quotes to my friends. I hope there are way more themes because I don’t have premium and I want to use more themes without paying money! I thank the creators for making this great app 😄
2,SleepyTrae,"I read a review saying you had to pay for everything, but I didn’t realize what they meant. There is literally only one free category, “general.” So if you want any of the other categories of quotes, you have to pay... that seems pretty lame. You can watch an ad to get some of the backgrounds, why can’t you do the same for categories? I won’t be paying for anything. I’m giving it a day to see how motivating the quotes are... One pro is the its super cute lol"
5,Shannon Le,"This app is a must have, no matter your age, lifestyle or career choice. I have never appreciated or been more grateful for an app until now. I feel like I have a true friend that is constantly, yet quietly lifting me up daily! Thank you for the joy on this journey we call life! SD"
4,earbuduser400,"Almost all of these motivation quotes are true about life; I just hate the ads!!!! I have my earbuds in listening to music and everytime an ad pops up, my music cuts off!!!! I don’t wanna do the subscription, but I’ll probably do it anyway 😒.  Anyways, it’s a great app ( other than those stupid ADS!!! Who in the world wants KITTY MATCH????) and I’d recommend to anyone who has problems in life."
5,queer_disabled,"I am going through a rough time in life, I feel motivated to put in the work to heal my body when and where I am able to. The continuous dings of motivation make a big difference. It helps me find motivation in other things as well."
1,Valued Customer 6364,"I loved this app but the widget feature (which is the only viewing feature I use) is constantly breaking. Currently I just see a black box on my iPad. Removing and adding it back doesn’t resolve it. In addition, I’ve lost 100s of favorites and suddenly have only 19. As far as I know, device sync still isn’t a thing so all my personal quotes will become vapor when I upgrade to next device. I regret investing time and money into this once good app."
5,Jokey Loki,"The motivation app truly is just that, a dose of small daily pick-me-ups that truly keeps me on a positive wavelength. Life has been anything but calm these past few years, so the motivation app gives me a small sense of positivity on the daily, and I’m grateful for it."
5,Lucy92*,"Walking through another rough season of my life and I am grateful I fell up this app. I literally just downloaded it and already began feeling encouraged with the first few quotes I’ve read. Thank you to all who put this together, God Bless you and yours!"
5,CJ_Hilgy,If I actually had money I would pay for the nose premium subscription they got. But the free version is still 10/10 recommend. This app has gotten me through a lot and boosts me up when I need it. Thank you
5,hiiiijem,This app has honestly helped me in so many different ways. I struggle with anxiety and depression and Motivation just keeps me pushing and wanting to do more. Motivation is a great app that I have recommended to friends and will continue to recommend
5,This Wife loves Guns,"This is by far the best app I have, always seems to pop up just when I need it! Thank you to the creators of Motivation! You truly have made an impact on my life! If you struggle with mental health or body dysmorphia issues, this app is for you too!"
5,cdiva22,Let me tell you this app is wonderful. This app helps me everyday it motivates me to keep going. When I’m down this app lifts me up. I get so many quotes and the correct quotes like the app is reading my mind. I love this app I definitely recommend it
2,Xylophone10101,"This app started hot a motivational quote every hour so it seemed, then it faded to nothing. I almost forgot about it. The motivational quotes it gave me were not inspirational for the most part but more narcissistic promoting self love and purging of people from my life. If it can’t serve me then trash it kinda vibe which I find as selfish and toxic. This app did not help me find happiness or motivation. Because it failed its purpose I am considering it two spilled Starbucks lattes. Not for me."
5,likes.scruchies,I love this it has many cute quotes and I love that there is never any of the same ones too each day and each time it shows a one its different. I definitely recommend having this even if you need a self boost
5,Nicola Carla,"Love this app so much just being able to read the notifications everyday makes so much difference. And, I feel like I can always apply it to my situations since I can choose the genre/theme of the messages. They don’t feel random because it what I ask for."
5,thisboi123,This app has really helped me with many of my emotional issues by uplifting me every-time I pick up my phone. My grades have gotten better and me as a person has gotten person because of the self-confidence this app offers. I have no issues! I love this app and I’m not deleting it anytime soon.
3,review writter 120982635,Everything that people actually need help with cost money. it’s ridiculous. like LGBTQ+ that’s something that many people deal with and need help with. I’ve been trying to get help on a break up for forever and I was really hoping that I would get help from this app but of course it costs money. Ive been using letting go instead which is ok and the quotes are good but it’s not exactly what I’m looking for.
3,"Dec. 21, 2019","I did really like this app, however when I found out that literally everything is locked I was very upset. The thing about it is I only got the app for fun and to try it, but what if I actually needed it? I’m not going to buy all that! So in short, if you just want an app to look at it only sometimes, I highly recommend this app for you, but if you need it I would look somewhere else."
4,unhappy Boo-er,"I love this app and it gives me motivation every single day but I would love it even more if all the categories were free.  I know you guys have to make profit somehow but I think this app would be even more delightful if everything was free. Also, I feel that people shouldn’t  have to pay to be motivated and to be happy.  Just a thought.  -Thanks, a teenager"
5,Sha Alm,"It motivates me. At 11:00 am & 11:00 pm it sends me some positive pushes that i need. I also have a very nice background with it. You can customize your background. I save it and have it as a lock screen so, i can always read it.  What i have as a background is : its a good day to have a good day with a person sitting on a cliff."
5,Love this App!12345678,I am so thankful that I got this app and it has inspired me so much! I wish that there was a way for the notifications to take up your whole screen for a second however many times you set it at. I love this app so much! Thank you to whoever made this!!!!
5,zmanbaseball2,This is app is by far the most used app on my iPhone recently. Even went premium for a year. Love the scheduling and categories. Too many to choose from!  Wishes: When searching quotes. Add the ability to view as quotes with the theme rather than just a list of search results that show the 1 quote followed by your previous category.  Add iCloud sync. I use my iPad and iPhone and the favorites do not sync from one to the other. This is a needed feature as most people have multiple devices.  Keep up the amazing work!
1,thegirlandhercamera,"I used to love this app. It had all great and amazing quotes. However, since the new update it got rid of all my favorite quotes. I spent the last two years favoriting every quote that spoke to my heart now I lost all of that in this new update. Also, it got rid of my mixes with all the quotes that I liked. Please bring back old version.  Edit: the new update keeps crashing every time I go to change the mix/ genre of quotes I’m reading"
5,manhattanbeach1,"I read several quotes each day, then I create a folder to read them daily. I greatly appreciate that some of the quotes are personalized with my name. Please keep them coming. They help me stay focused.  How do I submit my own motivation quotes that appear on your app?"
5,Kiayla93,"This app really does starts my day! It’s very positive, spiritual, & uplifting. I encourage other’s every morning by leaving a positive thought on their mind to get them through their trials and tribulations. Thank you very much for creating such an amazing app for people such as myself.   -Tay"
5,Markedus D,"This app taps into who I am and can be as a person. Sometimes you needs those daily affirmations from somewhere else to push you along into the right direction. And this app does that for me, and you, too, if you give it a try."
5,Sammi,This is one of my favorite Top 10 apps! I have been using the free version for a while now. Just purchased the yearly to unlock more options. I Love getting quotes throughout the day. When I get one and read - it always makes me smile
5,dinolil2836186,I first started opening the App Store to get something motivational to keep me going and to keep me thinking and remembering myself who I am and who I will be this app is really good to keep u focused in whatever u come upon so I definitely recommend this app for all
5,Pastel Neko,I myself was cyber bullied for all my life without knowing it from my best friends. I finally left them with the advice from this app. This app has motivated me through tough times. I recommend it to anyone that needs motivation.
4,Vinceno1212121212,I love the app I paid for it and everything although I only bought this app because of the widgets option. It won’t let me “Edit Widget” on my home screen and it kinda gets at me because I spent the money but I was wondering if the app could fix that. Anyway great app just would be better if that problem was fixed!!
5,Ryan6368,This app always is my go to if anything goes wrong my life it is amazing and has been inspired throughout tough times and I know it will continue to inspire every day 24 times a day in 12 hours so if you are going through tough times I recommend this app to make you inspired
5,t4yi,"I love this app, though there’s a member ship for extra features like categories and themes. I don’t really mind though, the quotes would always make me feel motivated to do stuff. The quotes also make me feel inspired and feel good about myself. This is really the only time I ever made a review."
5,.......lovelylou,"I never really do reviews but this app has to be anointed by GOD .. it helps pull you through at exactly the time you need it! I encourage you all to accept notifications from this app. I pray for God to send his angels of protection around all HOLY people & all Sinners, we all need CHRIST JESUS. Thank you Jesus for working miracles in my life, I love you  Amen"
5,GMM__forever,The quotes bring me up so much when I’m down and my phone is filled with screenshots. The only recommendation I would make is to send more notifications with quotes in them. Other than that it’s an amazing app that has helped my mental health in more ways than I can ask for.
5,Annelle B.,"I love getting these little quotes throughout the day! (You can always modify how many you want daily). Whenever ever I am not feeling my best, it’s nice getting the little reminders to just keep pushing and direct my thinking back in a positive route! I would recommend his for anyone."
5,Rebelcop,This is an awesome app and I personally think it is one of the Best apps with some of the best motivating quotes I have ever had. I enjoy them so much. Some quotes are from Great Persons who give me real joy and love and I share them with friends who need comfort and LOVE. And now I know how to help them and myself. Thanks you so very much for this AMAZING APP. God Bless you and your staff.
5,nyha UwU,"This app is so good. It motivates me and is super cute! I already needed an upgrade to my Home Screen and definitely needed these quotes. I just think you have to pay for a lot of things, but it’s ok because I still loveee the app! 9.8/10 recommended 🎀"
4,Diva Dresser,"App was really nice, quotes inspiring, would like foul language in quotes not spelled out or removed from app quotes, while many who have said positive things for positive encouragement, foul language is not positive at all. Referring to quote by Toni Morrison while she is highly regarded and Beloved I think foul language does not promote motivating actions. Thank you."
4,Ivaann12,"Hey! The app is great, so far the quotes are inspiring. The only is that when clicking the drop down notification it disappears to a different quote and when clicking to share or save it also disappears right away. I’m not sure if it is clear but I’m sure it will get fixed."
5,iUwUforever,"I absolutely love this app it gives me perfect quotes and get my day started every day with reading 15th them the only thing I hate is that you have to pay for certain things, but you know that’s like every app nowadays so yeah"
5,ellejnk,This app is worth every penny for the widgets and the watch notifications. I’m trying to stay motivated for exercise and eating healthy and these little customized reminders that keep popping up and are on my home screen are helping to keep me on track. I love it.
3,RedVelvet08,"I love the motivational quotes (this is why I downloaded the app)! But I don’t need THIS much motivation! It’s like every few mins there’s another notification. There are waaaaaaay too many. I think 1-2 each day would be plenty, but it’s like 7-8 on the avg day. Unless there is a way to adjust the frequency in the settings that I am missing, I will be deleting."
5,Sjl0526,"Omg I am a powerfully optimistic person on my own, but I need pick me ups. This app is my new drug! Beautiful quotes custom tailored to my interests, customizable features, and alert notifications. Plus I can easily share across platforms! This positivity is contagious and I want the world to have a new pandemic to talk about!"
3,well heres the thing...,"Unfortunately I didn’t even get to use this app and it would have been amazing if it didn’t cost money, most people go through hard times and do not have money to spare and with a little motivation a day you shouldn’t be carrying the weight of worrying about money when your paying for an app to help you and be more uplifting."
5,Need Words with Purpose,These messages have become a light in the dark.  Some are just what you want to hear while others are just what you need to hear.  All of them are absolutely necessary now to get me through the day!!
5,mia s mia s,"Ok so this is very good , I absolutely love this app 🤩. It motivates me to do soooo much more! Even though I don’t agree with some of the quotes it’s probably best ! Overall rate 10/10. Oh and I forgot the best part about it is I have it on my wedgets and so it’s like a daily quote I can’t scroll past which very much motivates me even more !"
5,lover2864,Motivation helps me a lot on the days I feel like I can’t do anything or don’t feel like anything. It makes me feel more understood and happy. As if someone is actually talking to me. I’m not really disappointed in anything so thank you for making my life a little better.
5,Nisha❤,It’s so motivational I always love to let the notifications build up and keep the quotes up until I have enough to take a long screen shot. I post these quotes on IG very often and they always come at the right time with the right words! I love anything that helps uplift my spirits and others spirts!
4,hai wabbit,I would really like only one quote a day and maybe get the option to refresh if the given quote doesn’t work for me.   Especially in the widgets. I love seeing the quote there but I’d like to stick to one for the day that can stick with me for a while and not refresh every time I open it.
5,dimaquibo,"Truly moving words spoken. At times where I needed a boost, the motivation notification came at the right moment and it knew what to say. that gave me goosebumps for sure. The quotes that don’t have a owner, in my opinion are the best ones.  Thank you again for this."
5,Mr Rogers Sr,I thank you for all the sayings that you guys put on my phone. It gives me warmth in my heart and happiness in my soul keep sending them because I have positive energy on days when I’m feeling down and depressed. I think you and God.
1,annaruppert,"I had wanted to try the free trial for this app, and ended up finding the app not useful. I canceled the free trial and IT STILL CHARGED ME. $30 for an app i NEVER use is absolutely crazy and if you could please get back to me as soon as possible if there is any way to refund the purchase. I am in desperate need. I had went to cancel the trial on the beginning of the third day since it says you get 3 FREE DAYS, but i had already been charged?!?!"
5,es tu loco,"Motivation app is just what it says. I’ve been through a hard time and when I got the app it helped me with anything I needed and picked going through categories. Health, relationships, depression, ego. Everything. I would 100% get the app!"
5,🔥💬,"I am usually a little apprehensive when it comes to motivational quotes, or people telling me how I should feel.  This application was right on point for me when I needed it. I highly suggest starting your day off with these motivational quotes."
3,Francylivin,I purchased this for a year because I thought it would be good to read motivational quotes each day. Well for my watch it shows the same ones over and over and a lot are not motivational. I would love to have real and more motivational quotes for my watch. That was the other main reason why I wanted this app.
1,istariphoenix,"Listen, we’ve all had it with the bait and switch!  “Cmon try our free app it’s awesome and free, it’ll help you, it’s free, try it nothing bad here and it’s free! let’s do it cmon now what have you got to lose it’s free Free FREE I tell you and it’s free and it’s good for you it’s motivational content and did we mention it’s FREE!  SIKE YOU NEED TO PAY NOW.  Irritating beyond belief!  If you’re a paid app, then list yourself as such from the get-go and don’t promote yourself as free. The only thing “free” was a 3-day trial. CMON!!!"
5,😳😲😒😠😡,This app will be the friend you want to lean on when they aren’t there. Never realized how impactful it was to have someone (or an AI) giving you constant reminders of your worth and strength. Keep your head up. Thank you developers.
4,Siarra B,"I was a little hesitant as first, but I am so glad I downloaded it! Seriously has helped me keep going through this rough 2 weeks more than I can express and the timing and resonance has been impeccable. Thank You for this App for making life that is already hard enough, just a little easier!!!"
5,SaintWuRLD,"Initial thought it was an average app, I even got the subscription accidentally. I have too say sometimes reading the quotes really get you up and tell you the stuff no one around says….would recommend!"
5,~~CG~~,"The notifications are not annoying and the quotes are very uplifting! They have all types of quotes for how you are feeling! Personally, I don’t enjoy getting constant notifications from apps but I don’t mind this one at all! Very good app! Recommend!"
5,cheeto human,"I am in love with this app! I personally think this is already my favorite app and I am so glad this app is a thing. It really helps with letting how with the past,realationships,being confident in yourself."
5,SookieVR,"Being able to set timers for reminders from the app makes a big difference! Set the reminders and let the app deliver motivational boosts throughout your day. Make the time to pause and read it, breathe deeply, and get on with it."
5,Ry'Lyn,The reason why you should download motivation because they have inspirational quotes and it builds up self esteem so yes I would give this app 5 stars if it was up to me it would be a 10/10 because I had this app for 2 years now so please download it💕✨
5,pep 657,"This app makes my day better as I go and it fills me up with joy, makes me feel confident about myself, and makes me feel loved. I really recommend that people get this app if not already installed! It’s is very helpful, and it is surprisingly affective to my daily life. Love this app!"
5,tamaxong,"I love this app. I like the different categories. I can change the type of quote I get based on what I need. I like getting the daily quotes. It helps me to pause for the moment during the day, receive something positive, encouraging or affirming and reset."
5,Tysyah27,"Before I found this app, I was depressed. I wasn’t smiling, I wasn’t eating and I wasn’t sleeping. When I saw this app on my friend Snapchat, I was like ""Hey! Let’s try this app out. It seems good."" And I downloaded it. Even since, I’ve been in the best mood lately. Thank you for making this app. It really helped."
5,lunar787,"I love how you can share your thoughts and help people throughout your day, we all have doubt sometimes but this app really lets you see there more people like you out there , it’s shows your not alone and you can even use other people’s ideas to help yourself ."
5,YeritRob,"I never write reviews, because no app has really stuck out to me. But here I am, because I absolutely love this app. Somehow, it really knows what I need to hear, and gives me a wake up call. I personally love getting a new message on my Apple Watch regularly. I highly recommend :)"
5,The bomb !!,"This is one of the only apps that I actually end up downloading and using. It’s simple and uplifting notifications are easy to set and motivating without being distracting. There’s a big library of great quotes, most of which I haven’t heard before. Great app!"
5,the best youve seen,"I literally just started this app today and I’ve already gotten so much happier mentally, the quotes are on point and I even got to customize them😳 this is awesome and I will be using it for the rest of my life, thank you to the creators, 🙏"
1,Johnxcock,"I am just absolutely dissatisfied and confused, I downloaded this app hoping to have some “daily motivation” And at first it was great I was getting my daily notifications and was thrilled, But then goes by a few weeks I was no longer receiving my “Daily Motivational Quotes ” and was absolutely gutted when I finally realized. I then go on the app to find I have to pay to get notifications and look at pictures which was even more displeasing. Goodbye!"
5,Payton’s review,This  app has made me regain confidence and make me a stronger human being. I highly recommend it. But you do have to subscribe for some stuff. This is your warning I hope you enjoy it just as much as me.
5,Jefferson L. Fritts,These daily quotes are beautiful. The $30 a year for the subscription was well spent. The widgets are very useful for hard times throughout life. I hope anyone reading this review will have eternal happiness through hard work.
5,jjafet g 23,This app is really helpful these motivational quotes this app gives are just beyond motivational this app can help you keep going and not fall into depression the s app is very helpful and makes a huge impact in our lives try it out for yourself 👌
4,I'mSarahofc,"Okay, I love this app overall. But maybe just let a few things be free? Like, if I wanted to create my own motivation quote, I’d have to get Premium. It shouldn’t cost money to spread love, encouragement, and kindness. Now don’t get me wrong! This app is wonderful! But just a little more things that don’t cost premium?"
5,danielasmiles88,"Love this app! Going through situations in my life and affirmations can really help ground myself and center myself within gratitude. These daily quotes (I have the max, 15/day) really help enhance perception and focus on the good and positive in life no matter the circumstances. I love the variety, thank you!!!!"
2,sfarkhan,I enjoy the app but the advertising is persistent even when you follow or try to exit. The advertising breaks the app and the only way to leave the screen is to close the app. This happens on the first quote it displays. I have other apps with advertising that handle it much better without breaking the app. Too bad because this would be a fantastic app.
5,bin2shiesty,I knew this app will help as soon as I started reading those quotes my mind and body was like yea that’s right know who you are stop tryna have everything else put you down be the greatest you can be .
5,buffjjhg,I honestly think it uses AI to look through your life and make suitable inspiration. I’ve been getting the messages of how I can change my life  a lot lately. I feel ready and motivated to be better.
5,Isrbeller,"This app has kept my positive vibe throughout the day,.i love saying and manifesting them out loud for the universe to hear. Turn on notifications and Screenshot the whole page, try it you can’t help but feel empowered!"
5,JacqueHoover,My nice daily motivational messages are awesome and helpful.  Just wish I didn’t have to pop into the app every few days to keep them goin. It really is nice and uplifting reading the quotes:)
5,fraternal 4ever,"These are really great quotes especially the categories that you can personally select to receive. Choose the most helpful quotes, save them and read them several times a day."
1,J_nred,"Update 30 December 2021: crap app! I pay for premium for what???? Just downloaded the last update and the widget still not working. Total ripoff!!!  Update: same issue!!! Widget always stops working. I will not be renewing the premium subscription. I paid for the anual subscription and after the last update the widget stopped working. What’s the point in paying for something that doesn’t work. I’ve uninstalled, reboot phone nothing works. Disappointed!"
5,May the ok for other,"This app really inspire you daily and each quote touch your heart ❤️   They provide feature to make your own quotes with their default design platform, and you can share it easily on social media!   LOVE 💗 it and looking forward for more future app!"
4,squidward 0097,"I have been using this app for quite awhile now just to lighten my mood, and so far it's doing a good job , but definitely needs some things to be worked on, like the notification come on every other day instead of everyday. But that's about it! LOVE This app, I would definitely recommend getting this app"
5,Emmanuel J. Williams,"I cannot name the many times that this app has spoken to my heart. Times that I needed the most guidance, I received the best quotes and words of inspiration and love. Through many difficult times, this app has brought words of encouragement to help me keep pushing forward. I love this app and I’m thankful for it.   Emmanuel J. Williams"
5,mrsandrews💓,I’m in love with this app. I truly am. Every notification gives me either motivation or hope for the future. Everyone going through any situation should download this app. You can customize to help relieve you of your exact situation.
4,Akhei,Hi support team  I didn’t know how to contact you so I’m asking my question here. I activated the app not knowing it would automatically change status to a paid one since two days ago May 12th. Although I have enjoyed it I need to cancel the paid plan. Can you help me do it. It’s only two days into the paid plan. Thank you
5,3redbirds,"I have been using this app for over a year and love it. The new update is frustrating, have to sit through a 30 second ad when you change themes is annoying."
5,pissedoffwoman10000,"I’ve been needing some motivation and this app does that. I can set it to be constant and it helps so much just a reminder to be positive, go harder. We spend a lot of time on our phone and a positive message coming through makes the difference."
5,shkfdy,"The motivation app is great. Period end of sentence, though I wish some of the other quote styles were unlocked. I understand you have to pay bills and I work at Sonic so I don’t have the money to pay for the one that I would enjoy. Thanks for reading."
4,Ally Courtney,"I love that I can get my motivations from just some notifications a couple times a day. I like how I can set the time from 7 to 10. The concept of being able to have your own theme is nice, I wish it had more options for the colors though. And you have to watch an ad for everything or go premium."
5,Ncognito1,"I never leave a review for these things but I definitely recommend this app. Simple, Impactful, and eerily Prospicience. No more searching the web for the right quote for the right situation!  Highly recommend for those daily affirmations."
5,Hannah-me,This so so nice because it give you motivation to start you day and make you feel better. Of you are having a bad day you just look at the app and you’re day will be so much better. ☺️
5,B Yak,The Motivation App is what I’ve needed for years. It helps motivate me to continue on my goals. Every step of the way since I downloaded this app. It has increased my motivation 10 fold. Highly recommend to family and friends!
3,3 Device Syncer,"I’ve had Motivation for a while now. Suddenly, I’m paying for ads.  Isn’t this supposed to work the other way? I pay so I don’t have to watch ads? Having to raise the subscription, that I get, inflation, we all get hit by it.   You know what undermines trying to get motivated? An ad right in the middle of my moment, in my face."
4,Ninjai22,I had the widget set on my Lock Screen where I’ll get new quotes throughout the day and I love it! But now I can’t get it on my Lock Screen anymore after upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro Max and it’s running iOS 17. I think this app needs an update so the widgets are available!
4,Nickname_Taken2345,"Recent fixes made the app worse. When opening up the quotes in the notification menu, a completely different quote would appear and I wouldn’t be able to read the quotes in its entirety. Would love that fixed. Otherwise new fixes made it smoother"
5,PERSONiNPROGRESS,I absolutely love and appreciate this app. It always sends the right message at the right time. I love all of the different options for the many different paths we all walk in life. I highly recommend this app to anyone!
5,NotSimo,"I Love This App, No Doubt About It. But As Of Recently Everytime I Open The App To Let’s Say, Save A Quote That I See In My Notifications, I Get An Alert To Renew My Subscription And It Resets My Background And The Quote, It’s Very Frustrating. And Plus I Never Had A Subscription In The First Place, So This Is Very Weird."
2,DMW7243,"Been using this app as a widget since those first started. Had all my settings and everything customized: background, categories, font, etc. After updating to the latest update this morning it reset the entire app and all my settings. Can't find the background I was using anymore, can't get the same settings back, nothing."
5,KaleDanielHicks,I literally just downloaded it and I already love it my only problem with it is the 20 dollars a year thing and only being able to access a little bit of the apps collections.
5,isaiah tolbert,"The reminders will catch you at low points where they’re most needed. It’s a great app to get you mind right and to remind you of the better things to come ,to keep you pushing."
5,dcfl,Great app but…. It would be nice to be able to categorize your favorites instead of them just being in the favorites folder and you have scroll thru all of them to find the quote you’re looking for.
5,scar loves dogs,"I used to hate myself and my body and the way I thought, I used to tell myself that I wasn’t good enough. But when I got this app it helped me realize that I’m perfect the way that I am. I highly recommend trying this app out"
5,H.a.p.p.i.n.e.s.s.1.0.1,"Whenever I go through a problem, ironically this app gives me the quotes I need. I don’t know if they are listening or what but they hit the nail every time. And each quote they give me helps me move a little farther on with my day."
3,"""777""","This is a great app but as far as daily reminders it doesn’t work every day. I will open the app daily, but still some day I don’t get my daily reminders. Considering the amount of money I paid for this app I shouldn’t have problems getting my daily reminders. It would be nice if they would fix this."
5,sxmrain,How do you always know what i’m thinking! The quotes are so accurate and they have the best ones right when i need them. I love that i can make it into a widget and have it right on my home screen. I don’t mind watching ads for new themes it’s only like 30 seconds.
2,Tricelit,"All I want is some way to take my own curated list of favorites quotes, and display them on my Apple Watch’s large complication. This app is *almost* there.  It needs a way to ingest a large amount of quotes.  I suggest being able to paste a LONG string of text separated by new lines.  Example:  Rule your mind or it will rule you. Horace  The ancestor of every action is a thought. Ralph Waldo Emerson  Etc.  Then, add an option to only show custom quotes on the watch.  Size the text to fit the complication.  Use a narrow font. Since there’s not a lot of room to work with, I suggest only showing the quote, then a tap on the complication will display the quote and the author.  As is, I can’t stand this app’s curation."
4,Sirrenidy,"So I put on the app to send quote notifications, and I put from 8:30AM to 12:00AM and they do not send the notifications unless I open the app and then they start sending them, or I will just go days without even seeing a notification. Which I need because quotes mean a lot to me, and they help me through the day."
5,Con+Con,This app is so awesome! I can share it with family and friends and read so many at a time. I can also get inspired and theirs quiet s lot of features I can use. Every morning I look forward to see the daily quote. All in all it’s amazing!
5,Terry McDaniel Momma T.,I love all of yalls lil sayings. I just love the app period!! It’s what I been looking 👀 for. For sometimes now. So yeah I probably will subscribe to and for this app. Just been looking 👀 at what yall post every day. And so far so good!! You guy’s are truly Great and very much Amazing. Thank you all for yalls hard work. To keep the motivation app goin. Thanks Terry Mc’Daniel.
5,DonDon2001,"I love this app soo much it really helps me make others happy while motivating myself to be better everyday it’s easy to send a quote to your friends or family and they have so many different quotes and designs it would take you 1,000 years to find every combination"
5,evokative shane,"I feel you are harassing me demanding a review and eating. Less than a week and EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app I read three words and BAM - blocked by the pop up demand to rate and write a review. It’s a pain, it’s too much pressure, it stops all fluidity. STOP IT!!!"
4,Coopwa,Home Screen widgets frequently go white or blank after updates. You have to frequently delete and add widgets back. And that doesn’t guarantee that it would add back and work. The quotes genuinely help my day! This is a minor issue but annoying
2,Misztamara,"These are some of the most mundane, repetitive, and uninteresting batch of quotes! I’ve had the app for almost a month now and most of them lack depth and are the same little nuggets of information/wisdom, just worded differently. As an avid reader, i’m very disappointed by the quality. It feels like quotes for teenagers. You’d do better getting the Headway app and acquiring quotes & insights from actual published authors."
5,TonyTone732,Such a wonderful app. It really helps motivate me and keep me focused. I love the timed notifications that you can set to reoccur throughout the day. Highly recommended for those who could always use a little insight or friendly reminder.
5,caibairien,I downloaded this apps with no crazy expectations but it seems to know what to say at the right time. Absolutely loving the extra words of motivation helping me push through and get things done.
5,kim production,Never give up because life goes on listen to the words that you read because the meanings are strong believe in your self no time for hesitation and if you need help study motivation🙏
5,edrien el pro,This game or quotes got my whole mood up and day y highly recommended this app for u if ur going through something or just song feel ok and sand depresed this is the app for u have a blessed day and yes this is writin by a young one love u all 🫶🥹
5,RAMONJUNIORVASQUEZ,"This app is very good, I downloaded the app thinking it would just be a boring app and very annoying but instead the quotes it gave me made me feel so much better I totally recommend it if your really feeling sad or depressed"
5,rosegoldismyfav,"Life changing words, reminders, affirmations… especially when you need it most. It’s a notification I always look forward to opening. Worth every penny and every feeling. ❤️"
5,cici mcmullin,"You can choose what type of quotes you want. For an example break up, happiness, and so Much more.       And out of the year I’ve had this app there has been only one curse word I’ve come across with.      But overall I love the app."
3,A Less Petty Person,After a few days it just stops alerting. The first couple days I’d get the motivation messages like clock work and then about a week later.. nothing. Which of course I forget about until I’m going through my apps realizing I’m paying for something that’s not functioning as intended 😒
5,miss.stacie.lynn,"While I’m sad to lose my settings and favorites, I’m glad I went to the comments to fix the widget issue. I always look forward to the quotes whenever I open my phone, or look at the time on my watch."
5,CutieShai,"This app gives the best quotes when needed. I don’t regret my payment for all the categories I got because every quote this app notifies me with, it helps with everything and it makes me feel better and happier. “Motivation” was the Bess name for this app because it really does motivate you."
3,gc1888yeeetccc33,So I’m going to give you an honest review. I wasn’t feeling happy at this time and I was losing weight and I wanted to keep going on my journey. I saw this app and thought it was perfect. I was setting it up and it said you had to pay? It’s basically telling you in order to be motivated and get quotes you have to pay? So I just looked up good quotes and read those. It would be a good app if it was free.
5,vicky*!444,"I give this a 5 because it does give me motivation and it looks so nice with the new iOS 14 update and it’s nice to have quotes that u can see and receive notifications from the app and giving you quotes,I love how u can pick how much a day u want and u can even pick a time"
5,crazymomma273927,"i knew i needed this app but not THIS MUCH. there’s quotes on here that i didn’t even know i needed to hear. i’m so grateful that i get reminders that help me through the bad days. this app is amazing, for those who don’t think it’s right for you, try it. you may change your mind :^)"
4,Mythycal girl,"Ok, yes. I love it. It has amazing quotes that are inspirational, but, premium. Argh. It makes me so mad. You have to pay to change your themes and to customize everything. You can make quotes which is awesome but they don’t let you see how many people have liked them and stuff. So yes, get it if you’d like, but be aware of all the terrible restrictions"
4,Anna martens,"This app works very well, at first I was scared to download it but it works. The only issue is that you have to pay for many things ( most of it ). I like the app though, it helps. It won’t let me enter the app at times but that is just some issues the app or my iPad is having."
4,J8YYY,"Hello, I have an issue with the building self confidence category I do not think it should be for money because some people are really insecure about their body and probably don’t have any money to buy the premium pack. I hope you guys can fix this your future update ."
5,TayNicole90,I have been dealing with the loss of my sibling going on two years now. Some days it’s really hard to stay positive. These quotes are sent to me through out the day and help keep my spirits up. They help me keep moving forward. I definitely suggest giving this app a shot.
5,zombiemermaid93,I used to love this app and now with the update you have to pay a monthly subscription for all the quotes that used to be free?! I’m sorry but I’m going elsewhere. It’s so ridiculous so many apps now require a subscription was really hoping this one would be different.
3,Armani🌸,"It’s a nice app with good quotes but the fact that you’re so limited to everything without premium is ridiculous. If you’re not willing to pay for premium it’s kind of hard to enjoy it because you can barely do anything but read the quotes. Even if you like them you’ll only be able to see 3 that you liked at a time, that’s so outrageous."
5,Kyleigh-123,I downloaded this when I had severe depression and self harm habits and this really helped me with my self esteem mental health and just made my day in general I have recommended this app to 8 people 7 of them have downloaded it. I recommend this app
3,Timothyj85,I allow the app to send me push notifications. And going through some things I notice that the app knows. Or maybe I just think it knows. Because I manage to get the perfect dose of motivation in just the right words at just the right time. I love this app. I share the quotes with other people. And they find comfort. Or motivation and inspiration in them as well as I do. Great app!!
5,#urmom2.0,i love this app so much. when ever i am feeling down i just whip out my phone and read these . personally i think they make a wiser person. if you don’t have this app what are you doing with your life? whoever made this app is my idol!🥰
2,Ray 472,"I dont find the quotes very interesting or original, you can tailor them to your liking but still don’t get much value out of these generic quotes.   The app was marketed as quotes you cant find anywhere else and something that would be empowering, i haven’t found that to be true.  Another subscription making someone else a ton of passive income."
5,random person mari,Only a hour in and reading these made me feel better and get my self together. It’s so stressful doing everything at once and I wanna give up but this app lets me know that I am worth something and should keep going.
4,YWriteANicknameIfAllRTaken,"Enjoy the app tremendously but it stops sending notifications.  I’ll get notifications and then without notice or reason it stops.  Disappointed when it doesn’t work, love it when it does."
5,Aggie____,I don’t know how this happen but I was charge without my consent. I did not register to have my card charge every year I try to cancel the subscription but no option what should I do.
5,bfkfjfkfjjd,It makes you a better person for example it said find someone who makes you happy who cares about you unconditionally
5,Thig03,"This whole idea behind this is just a very good thing. Sometimes, there just isn’t someone around to say the things one needs to hear, that are encouraging, but not overly so. Both thumps up for this one"
5,MisseyZee,"I’ve only had this app for a couple of days and I’m already having a new and better mindset. When you don’t have people in your life to say these things to you, it’s helpful to have the reminders"
4,Onelovealways,"Everyday I read these, I’m a nurse, recovering addict,  mother of two beautiful boys, a wife, a daughter.. during covid I lost 16 patients in 6 weeks. I become like a robot. This app helped me through some very difficult moments and helped me to remember what’s important. So to the people behind the app, Thank you for what you do.  Grateful  ✌️🙏"
2,Sharifdream,"I’m a long-term user of this app, and was giving it 4 to 5 stars for years. Also, I referred other people to it.  That is changed, now that do you have these grossly interrupting video and audio advertisements! And, you can’t get rid of them! The only way is to dump the entire app… Which is what I’ve been doing.  It’s still not enough. I’ve used your app to get into the right frame of mind for my daily meditation. Your video and audio advertisements put me in exactly the WRONG frame of mind.  I’ll wait a week, and if I don’t hear anything or see a change, I’ll demote you to one star and dump the app in favor of something else.  Sorry about this, but I hope this demonstrates how serious I am."
5,Conjo2012,"Very few apps get my rating. But I will take the time to write this one. With the iOS 14 update and the widgets feature, having this on my first screen is rather refreshing. I always get remind of who I am as well as the person I am inspiring to be.  Great app. I do recommend it."
5,lovelybiancax,Not sure if I’m the only one . But indeed this app has a special power! This app seamlessly channels in with my energy. I’ve had this app for quite some time now and know matter the day I’m having I always receive a special word of encouragement.😍
1,jbooch5,"I had to re-download, and now all the categories are different. I tried re-downloading again, and the categories are even more different than the last. Every time it’s something different and I can’t pick the ones I had originally, they just don’t show up. This app is so inconsistent, things change every time you install it. And feels like you have to watch an ad anytime you tap something. Trying to find a better more reliable alternative."
4,MisoPogi,"I CLEARLY unsubscribed off on this app on the third day of trial and then a couple days later while i still just have the app installed i get CHARGED? 20$?? hello I already DID unsubscribe and wasn’t getting any quotes but this bs still charges me. disappointed   edit: I got my refund back, not that disappointed anymore."
4,life is awesome😎,"i love this app. its really helpful and helps with anxiety/depression and lots of other stuff. but... its the premium thing. theres a ton of stuff thats locked and you cant have unless you have premium. i know a lot of apps have stuff like this but if there were just more stuff already unlocked before premium, that would be great!! again love this app and totally recommend it! also! yall should add a search bar so that users can search for a specific quote that they saw or to search someone to see their quotes instead of wanting a certain quote and not be able to find it"
5,Ben1344455555,Thank you so much for this last update. It’s a nice gesture considering the current situation in the world. I love this app overall. It allows me to heart my favorite quotes and also gives me as many reminders each day as I’d like. I’m never without motivation. Thank you!
5,Final.skyy,"If you’re having a bad day I swear these quotes will cheer you up and honestly, help you change things around. New quotes everyday make you think about your life differently and helps you improve!! When and if no one can do that,this app is here for you! Download it."
5,Dàÿ Øñę,"I’ve bin using this app for more than a year now and this has impacted my life greatly the motivational quotes that I get from this are powerful, uplifting and energetic... and it looks to me like they know the exact moment when to send these quotes lol... just keep it updated and keep it moving..."
5,OdinThor1,"I absolutely love this app.  It’s simply the best ever.  It gets me out of bed on the right foot.  Keeps me going all day in the right direction and puts my mind at ease when I go to bed.  Grateful and blessed for this app.  Five Stars all the way. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,HeyKeyz,"I love this!! At times we all go through trials and question ourselves and it’s at that moment for me that I get a quote or advice even, at just the right time. I even share with family and friends!!"
5,Rogerkid1234,Besides the ads (come on this is free what did you expect) this is a great app. Has many good quotes and sends you daily quotes at given times during the day that will surely make your day or make you feel motivated. I would recommend this app as one of the best quote apps on the App Store.
1,Smileychild2815,"I pay for the premium option on this app and it doesn’t work more than it actually works. I’ve updated it and still nothing. This time it’s a blank white screen. Last time it kept showing the same quote over and over, just with a different background. I’ll be canceling the premium if this doesn’t get resolved. I’m tired of paying for something that doesn’t work."
5,tiffl15,"User experience is perfect, easy, and efficient. Receive as many (or fewer) personalized motivation notifications. Price is higher than I’d typically spend on an app, but it’s the only I have found to fulfills my needs."
2,Hughesjer,I feel like the majority of the “motivational quotes” I get regardless of topics selected are all talking down about other people. They are mostly negative and I’m not sure how that is supposed to help motivate people. I was hoping for motivational inspiration or at least positive affirmations but that’s not what this has provided over the last few weeks. I was hoping for more from this.
5,BecksCollier,Not only do I love the app and the widget feature on my Home Screen but the developers are amazing! I reached out when my widget stopped working and they went above and beyond to create a fix to get it working again!
5,Sammyslamdance,"The greatest instance. I was feeling low, I decided to use the app again. I started setting it up I skipped a few steps to get to the words of wisdom. Then it stopped me to ask for money. It’s not wrong, it’s not bad, it was just the greatest instance."
1,bo momba,This app was fantastic. So much so that I bought the paid version to expand what I would receive. After purchase all of the motivation widgets stopped working. It lets me go into the app and look at quotes: however it will not let me select it from the add a widget screen. I’ve tried all of the help screens and nothing seems to help. I should have just kept the free… I will change my review if this is resolved.
2,Allie Xo7,"I love the quotes on this app and they are always so spot on. However, this app glitches so much and never  wants to open. I'll open the app and it force quits, making it impossible to use and be able to keep the reminders.   The price point for an app that rarely works it too much.   They need to fix this issue. It is extremely frustrating."
5,Anonymous666!,i absolutely love this app! i will say it is kinda creepy tho lol bc everytime im in a sad mood or im down or in my head i ALWAYS get a notification from this app that actually relates to whatever is happening to me that day n cheers me up. 100% recommend!
5,klinnzzie,This app keeps it simple and truthful…I appreciate that it focuses on caring for self first ..as everyone knows you can’t help anyone if you don’t Love and Respect self and all the awesomeness I can bring to the table of Life. Life is a celebration.. To be enjoyed with people who respect and reciprocate
5,boxystarfish157 gamer,I was on a really rough time in my life and a lot of bad things happened and I gave up. This app helped a lot to help motivate me to get out of the slump and get better. I 100% would recommend this app to anyone’s who’s in a rough time.
5,MonieQ2,"Sometimes our life’s become so overwhelming, us as humans forget to know this too shall pass and we let the negativity take over when quotes like this help guide us in the positive and right ways to live our lives."
5,WriterBrit,The variety of quotes in this app are outstanding! Most of them are new to me - and the customizing that is possible is wonderful - especially the option for a widget on my home screen!
5,Ikeman624,I really enjoy this app. The UI is smooth and user friendly. The quotes options are countless and well varied. The Devs response to issues reported by customers is fast and effective. Job well done and keep this up!
5,CJ_1205,"When I am having a bad day, I will scroll through the app and I will feel a whole lot better, this app has helped me through a lot and I honestly could never feel better"
5,BulletMaker,"These thoughts and saying pop up on my phone throughout the day and it reminds me to treat others better, it gives me a better outlook on the day and it makes ME be a better person."
5,SlyFox671,"Thank you for being there for me when I needed you. I share you with friends and family because sometimes just one word can save a life. Thank you for inspiring me to save mine and to help others. God Bless...   Sincerely,  Sylvia Mendiola"
3,Shia Maria,"I love the quotes but hate how if you don’t open the app they cancel your notifications. I shouldn’t have to keep opening the app in order to have the notifications sent to my phone, especially when I paid for a one year subscription for quotes specifically to have them randomly sent."
3,Tasha Launch,This app is totally five stars but by the 2nd-3rd week of continuously resetting reminders just to get the quotes you love is annoying.   I rather be asked if I want to changer the reminder time (to get the quotes) than having to continually do it or not get any quotes that I’m paying for. Again I live the app just do something about the reminder setting! Please!!!!!!!!
4,alarimer93,"Love every quote that I get! Only thing I wish is that instead of it constantly giving me quotes each day, I could get one quote for the day and that be my inspiration. Sometimes I really like a quote and when I go back to look at it, it’s already changed to a new one and I don’t get to see that one again."
5,KAM_12,"Not sure what happened. But I can longer view my quotes that I’m notified about. If I want to get premium l, I will. If this isn’t fixed, I’ll be deleting the app. And for this you get one star. Before this, I thoroughly enjoyed the app."
1,@1JaiJayz,Until 2 days ago this app was amazing! Unfortunately now EVERY time I click a notification to read the quote all I see is an ad! I can no longer read the quote I opened the app for. Please fix this immediately it’s very unfair to bombard your free users with constant ads to upgrade/download your other apps/leave a review. Once in a while I can understand but not EVERY time I open the app. PLEASE FIX IT ASAP because I’m ready to uninstall as this app is practically useless to me now.
5,Ismeniaa,This app literally sends me a perfect quote for every mood. My parents were arguing and the quote said “You can’t control everything. Sometimes you just need to relax and have faith that things will work out.”
5,ShayeeButta,This app gets me through my depression that likes  to leave and come back it also teaches me to have a good attitude I set my quotes for LIFE and it’s crazy when I’m going through something the quotes that I need or the quotes that apply to me at that moment in my life shows up I Love This app
1,AngeliaMegahan,"I’ve been a subscriber and avid user of Motivation. I love it and send relevant quotes to my husband, kids, and friends periodically. I would like to see more representation of diverse people in the app. Just about every theme featuring a person of color involves sports. People of color read, write, create. They don’t just exercise and play ball. At first I thought this was just a coincidence, but now that more themes have been added, I think it’s being done intentionally. Representation of people who mirror my children’s identity matters."
5,je9'sFAVS,Love the saying I m always been addicted to something shopping stealing drugs alcohol can never wait???? I am going on my 50 years alive 49 this year 50 big one next year my Dad is so sad I’m doing as much as I could my husband pd for tuitions for grade school high schools and college in cash I feel used
5,🌻Little_Sunflower🌻,"I love this app soo much! I have only had it for a little bit but, it has already made me feel better about myself😊 It is just amazing😍Thanks to everyone who made this app and put so much hard work into it to make others feel better about theirselves😊👍"
5,Money Monté,The free version is great but the premium is definitely worth it. I love how some of them correspond with the day like Monday and Wednesday quotes that pop up when it’s been a rough day they lift me up! And the scenes as backgrounds are soooooo amazing! Overall this app was well put together and keeps me uplifted.
5,Ade.S,I’ve downloaded this app since the summer of 2018 when I was dealing with some difficulties and initially it was just for myself and later grew to something more. It’s a great pick me up and you can also tailor your quotes for specific things as well.
5,YoungEse,"It really helps when you’re going through something. Because it makes you keep your head up and stuff. I really recommend it to anybody trying to persevere, stay positive, or go through something."
5,Wise Knight,This is the first time that I’m writing a review I usually don’t leave comments or write reviews  But today when I entered this app (after having it on my phone around 7months) I got surprised! Cuz it shows respect because of sticking around for so long and give me accessibility more than before by letting me to change more settings which were non free!!! I appreciate this application very much that I even let it to show the sentences and notifications on my smart band  Thanks for creating such magnificent application  I will stick with you.....
5,Faith Akoth,I love this app so much because it inspires me to become a better person every day even though it's hard I'll get there cause it could just make it better for me to realize how life is and to understand and to be strong for me and my family.
5,Stacey2773,Honestly didn’t think it’d make much of a difference but here I am writing a review to let you know it has … the out of the blue words of wisdom and encouragement definitely pep me up when I receive them. thanks so much🙏🏽🫶🏼
5,fVanilla,"One of my girl friends showed me this app & I am so thankful that she did! The Motivation App has been helping me stay on track and keeping me motivated every day! I enjoy all my quotes every day so much, I tell anybody I know about this app LOL"
5,KeeganArmstrong,This app is really good for those who don’t have motivation to be a better version of themselves. I definitely recommend this app if you want to achieve that goal.
4,You don’t know who,"It’s a good app for it’s wiggets and it helps in times when you are down. Only problem is everything is behind a subscription that is a lot and they need to have more pictures of name brand baseball bats such as Easton hype fire of Rawlings icon or demarini zoa or the Marucci catx composite. But hey, those are just my ideas."
4,Gemma📯,Good but not my favorite because It won’t let me change my name it’s making me put a gun to my head but that’s what this app is for right??? So thank you for letting me get over this with your amazing categories and letting me choose mental health because that’s what I want to focus on!!!
5,Chrislyn_120,I deal with mental health issues everyday fighting to get up this app helps me to stay in the right track and think positive no matter what you go through god can bring you through anything..!!
5,ToyaD20,I know I chose what topics I wanted to be motivated on but it seems the motivation app know when I’m going through a rough patch in life and always there to give me quote that is right on time and on target! I love this app and I wouldn’t remove it for anything.
4,sciancatto,"I bought the Premium subscription for this app, because I really like it and want to support the team. Why are there ads in the quote feed for other products? Shouldn’t I be free of them? Please look into this; otherwise, it’s a solid app. Good job."
5,kyky💕:),It definitely gives you motivation to succeed in life. can’t wait to see where this app takes me!!! Definitely recommend this to you if you motivation in life!!!
3,Kate star struck,"Oh my goodness I absolutely love the quotes. I agree with everyone else that they are incredibly motivating and I love having them at hand when I’m writing to others. Truly great. However, to have them all on my iPhone and then not be able to get them on my iPad it’s very frustrating! That really bothers me. Is it a big deal to fix that?"
5,Lexieeeewe,I love this app so much. They helped so much with what I was working on. Getting those quotes through out the whole day made me feel better about what is going on in life. 10/10 recommended.
5,Allura💐,I got this app cause life happens. It gets you up to brings you down somehow this app know just what to say in just the right time. I’ve sent a lot of these to my friends and they’ve been so amazed on how relatable they are.
2,Bus81,I like this app but the app is not consistent I pay for the whole year and I have to keep turning my phone off and on so it can work and I’m at the point I just don’t even turn it off and on anymore I have the timer set for the quotes can show up on my phone and my watch eight times a day and it might work the first day that you reset it and it does not work anymore.
5,MelTess-Mompa-4-LYFE,"I never leave reviews, my first time. But- I just want you guys to know this app truly helps motivate me every single day. It always says exactly what I need to hear every time! Def worth the money to subscribe. I’ll forever have this app!"
5,Finallydone,"I am so glad I chose to download and pay for this subscription!! The daily, multiple motivation statements have been giving me confidence to walk through many challenges that I face concerning different situations in my life!! I highly recommend it!!"
3,CNCOFan,"So I found this app because I wanted to try to make myself a positive mindset. But I was really disappointed because you have to practically buy everything. Honestly I hate apps that make you pay, especially when people are trying to find some comfort. I understand that they need money but at least make it cheaper."
5,sarah apolo,I think this app is amazing!!!q I use it everyday half of my family use it! When I’m bored I usually come on here and read a verse a day!!! It so good! I very much prefer you to get it!!! And I don’t have’ much to say because this app is nothing but good!!! Thank you   -your local app user
5,pizzapuppies12,"I was having a hard time a few years ago, and I got this app to get through it. I got through that and it healed me. I forgot about it, and just got it back and I am so thankful! I recommend this to anyone no matter what is going on in your life!"
5,A child of God 125,"So, I have Severe Anxiety, SAD, OCD,  And Sensory Processing Disorder, and it’s mental heath awareness mouth In all, and all of the quotes focused on metal heath or not seriously help so much, the fact I get to chose how many notifications I get is awesome too, I had this app for almost a year and I love it and definitely recommend it! Thx for reading!"
5,💃👯‍♀️,This is my favorite app especially with premium. I have anxiety and this helps me a lot. It’s not perfect if you don’t have premium but it’s still pretty good. The only thing I wound change is letting the person have more notifications per day
5,"howsmyname""taken""","This app has allowed me to be happier in the life I’ve been given, I encourage anyone who needs it to download it, and even if you just need a little boost throughout the day. You can have multiple different quotes or just one, choose what best fits your lifestyle. Enjoy."
5,Evelyn Madriz,"This app is great , my friend posted one of the quotes and i like what it said and so I downloaded the app and ever since, everything has been better for me , it always sends me what i need to hear and helps me get through my dad , i totally recommend !"
5,Kp44445,"Once you read the information it’s like you can’t turn back, it makes you want to read more. & the more you read the more everything resonates!!!"
4,donaldtrump69420,"I love this app, i love how you can set the amount and time frame of the notifications, but maybe have free 7 day trial without having to put in you information. I know you’re a business, but if i could see all of what the difference is compared to free to a plan, I may get a full plan."
4,lelichten,i love it so far (30 mins) but it was loading for about 25 minutes. This happened on the (im pretty sure) last stage of setting up. additionally can there be an option for more notifications?
5,Nathan0v0,"Use this app to motivate yourself in doing stuff this can help you through your mind, body, and even if your depressed, use this app to help you get strong in the mind"
5,M&MZO,"This app has lifted my spirits up when I have been down , has help me and others to empower with great affirmations  Thank you for this app , for the ones who created this app God bless you, after the Bible I read this app daily."
5,renob4u,Are y’all watching and listening through my phone because when I’m going through it this app chimes in every time with something super supportive
5,Older Mack,"I’m so glad you are doing this amazing post, and a too zoo daily, on the self help quips and quotes for inspiration and ideas that encourage us to keep going forward for positive outcomes in our lives. Thank you for your consideration!"
2,GliterGirlPixie,"There's an African-American specific section, but no Asian American or Woman section. Would be so much better with those sections available. Would also be great if you could add a quote to multiple collections at a time instead of having to add them one at a time.  Also wish there were more Health and Fitness options, like ""Diet Motivation"" for example."
5,Big JG24,Saved my mental health with small reminders when i needed them throughout the day reminded me to remain focused and it was okay to feel very normal human emotions would buy the premium option if i could afford it 5 stars !
5,Jocelyn darmour,"But this app is amazing and is very helpful for someone like me who needs reassurance and guidance,being positive and there is multiple different options on what you want your quotes to be centered on."
5,know to the world,This is really helping me I really love it you guys should really get it. It helps you figure things out even if your dad or mad it doesn’t matter I love it and imma give it five stars because it really works
3,UKtoPA,"I really enjoy the prompts throughout the day and the number of different categories but the app doesn’t work anywhere near consistently enough. One day I’ll get the correct number, but then nothing for days on end. I’m not close to the max of 60 scheduled reminders either. It’s a shame"
5,Andrew Araiza,"I’m writing this review because these quotes help me out get through these hard times. I feel like everyone should get this app, to understand what others feel."
3,BasicBrittani on YT,"I watched an ad to unlock a backdrop for the widget. Every time I click the app notification, it pops up that I need to renew my premium subscription.   Don’t want to right now, but might later.   So it’s like “okay, reset all my settings” and removes the background that I watched an ad for. I think that’s an oversight."
5,Imjustme!,"I literally love it this app so much. I use it daily, sometimes for hours at a time. It’s literally the best app and it’s truly motivating. I won’t tell you too much about the app because you need to try it out for yourself, BUT DOWNLOAD IT NOW PLEASE!!!!!!"
5,Ruth8117,Thank you for making this accessible to so many people for a long period. It’s disappointing people are restricted to only receiving motivational quotes if they have the excess budget. This company is truly doing good work.
5,Aldo Valverde,"The only thing that I miss about having this app installed on my phone is the picture that used to be in the background of that text. Besides that, works smoothly as advertised 🙌🏽"
5,Pattybald62,I’ve subscribed to a few daily quotes and inspiration apps but this one has hit everything truthfully and always comes at a time when needed highly recommend this.
5,YuriNikko,I really liked the quotes at first but they ended up repeating and cycling through the same ones. If you are OK with that then the app is fine but I ended up having to look for more varied quotes elsewhere.
5,drako tyshawn,"I really love this app, it’s so uplifting! It also will confirm your ideas shortly after your thought has gone through, but then again, it may just be me! I am grateful someone posted this app so i can use it! Such a positive vibe ✨✨"
5,Laylani!!!!!,This is the most wonderful app and I love that every hour you get more motivation and it helps with everything leaving the past behind and makes you want to wake up to it and I think you’ll really want this app
1,MissKarinaU,"I paid for my subscription, but have been so disappointed.  Randomly I stop getting daily reminders. So I have to go into the settings, delete them and make new ones, then they work for a couple of weeks and then stop working randomly again.  I specifically turned off all religious motivations, yet I still get so many religious ones!! I even contacted support and they expressed that there was nothing they can do.  If I could- I’d get a refund."
5,goodmisty2020,I love this app! One thing that people aren’t mentioning is if you hold down the app you can change the color of this icon! That is awesome for people trying to make an aesthetic Home Screen
5,Dolwnload this game,I don’t know why you have to pay and I feel that you should have to do that but over all it’s a really good app and has helped me in times of need.
5,Vypyer,"I’ve only had this app for about a week, but I must say it’s so worth it. The reminders are always amazing and with every quote I feel better about myself. This app has taught me new things and how to better look at myself in just quotes..now that’s amazing 💕"
4,#huffl3puffru13s,"I really enjoy this app, it makes me feel special.   However, I think that we should be able to make our own themes without paying $20 a year for it!   That’s all I want, to make my own themes.  Otherwise AMAZING app!!"
2,Poppy Blake,"The lifetime subscription to this recently doubled from $40 to $80. For a lifetime it might be worth $40, but certainly isn’t worth $80. The app is adequate, sometimes repetitive, sometimes a little too Stuart Smalley. I really liked the watch component. It is too bad as I have their affirmation app (lifetime purchase before a similar hike) and I like it. I thought this would be a good complement. However, with the price hike I can’t justify supporting the developer further."
5,Sjchshdh,"Well, you see, I always feel depressed or I’m blaming myself for things.. so I saw the ad and I saw that “dealing with depression” was on there, and the quotes are enough to make me smile for ONCE! Thank you for this amazing app!       I usually don’t take to ads!"
5,Prae2010,This is the best app ever because whenever I say something that was true I knew I had to heart it and save it and use it as my lock screen or home screen. And that’s why I gave it 5 stars and you should know that these are the best wallpapers I have ever seen in my life!!!!!!!!
5,Urbangorilla 2012,Sometimes you wake up in the morning and really you’re just looking for some direction for the day… Here you will find it! I recommend this very highly and without any reservations an awesome way to start your day.
5,Maddiethebaddie_mads,This app keeps me going when I’m mad or upset about something. When I don’t feel at my best i always read the quotes I get and either get a good laugh with my friends or get a big boost of confidence.
3,stella momma,Some of the quotes are not as much motivating as I would like.  But the real reason for my review is to strongly recommend the editors investigate further into their quotes. Today’s referenced the movie The Warriors and I’m pretty sure they have not seen the movie. The quote they used is actually said tauntingly by a murderous psychopath. Probably not the message they are going for.  I’m just saying.
3,BLAZNDiVA,"I’ve been using this app for a while and sometimes it has some really great quotes, the only problem is that it’s the same 6 quotes all the time! There’s always updates to add new things but nothing to fix the widget issues. Truly annoying, and will not renew when it’s time."
5,heavlm,"this app is just so comforting. it supports me the most and it makes me feel at home and ease. it even makes me feel as if I’m in a safe place, and the crazy part is i just got this app. keep going motivation 👌🏽🤍"
5,Char_125,I get stressed sometimes but this always helped me get up off my feet and have life and be myself and sometimes you have to let motivation come and help you! Definitely recommend!!!!
3,qtpie248,Great app/widget but lately (the past 2 weeks) there’s times where the widget is fully black or white with no quotes and I can’t get it to come back! If I open the app it shows my quotes fine and the widget settings are normal. I’ve even tried to make a whole new widget but it doesn’t solve the issue!
5,Ame🌹,This app helps me a lot when I feel sad or I just need to read something that makes me feel good which I tell my bf angel quotes and of course he loves them too   So thank you so much for this app it really helps people 💕
3,SolarExtermination,"Plz add the option to have quates in random hours of the day instead of specific time, getting it in the same time everyday makes it monotonous and dull to the user overtime, also i wanted to purchase lifetime sub but it’s like 99$, extremely expensive, 49$ would be a reasonable price."
5,i dont know 😐,"This app is everything to me I love it so much, so much It probably became an, addictive. But still, it’s really helpful. There might be a swear every now and then, But whoever made this, they put a smile on my face, And keep me happy, joyful and motivated to do things Honestly, I don’t think I'm ever going to delete this app, It’s to good, a little TOO good. Every time, and i mean EVERY time i use this app, it puts a happy smile on my face, i would REALLY recommend this for your kids, and like I said.  Best app yet  P.S One of the users!   😊"
4,162930GH,"I love this app and positive quotes.   The thing that bothers me is that even on a strictly positive quotes setting, I still get negativity charged relationship ones.   I’m working through issues with my husband and these quotes make it hard to remain positive while we’re working through it."
5,K8 da gr8!!! heckya,"Loveeee this app ! Awesome, motivational quotes popping up on your screen however often you set them to (I recommend more rather than less- they’re all amazing!) … So positive, relatable and uplifting! 10/10 recommend 👌🏻"
5,Had2change,"When you least expect it, a quote pops up that seems to be the right quote for the exact right time, when you need it the most!"
5,cbirchfield,The custom reminder settings allow you get notifications as often as desired. Also the quality of content is great and always uplifting. Also the customizable background of the quotes is a nice touch.
5,PennState0409,You have taken away my favorite theme I always used. It was a white back ground with gold lettering. Not sure what font. I have tried to make my own but it’s just not the same. Please bring it back as an option.
3,Pig world,I guess it’s not really your fault.. I’ll just write this for my own being.. I’ll give you a 3 start rating because it’s not your fault.. but your app is making me feel worse.. for some reason the quotes are making me feel bad for not being able to do things... like they want me to keep pushing myself forward but I can’t do that... alright.. I’m done.. bye bye..
2,005starz,App is awesome love it so much exceptttbfor the stupid ads nothing kills the motivation like an ad every 30 seconds or every 2 or 3 quotes.... it stops the flow as soon as I’m stuck watching minute to couple minute long ads really demotivates me... when I’m tapped into the flow I want it to continue without having to spend money and consume(which one my open still goes with the system that goes against self awareness🤦🏻‍♂️)
5,Encryptiz,I love seeing the new quote notifications pop up a few times during the day. Somehow each quote seems perfect for how I’m feeling or my current situation. Its simplicity is what makes it so effective. Well worth the cost for the premium subscription.
4,chicheart317,"I love the fact that when I look at my watch and see the motivational messages and my physical activity, it motivates me to work harder at accomplishing my goals. For someone who doesn’t have anyone to cheerlead her on, I thank you for creating this app which is now on all of my apple products.💕"
5,zzzxjfnsksbckfjendcb,"Ok so a couple days ago(2days) I broke my ankle(im a gymnast) and I have competitions literally next month😱 but when I got this specific quote I rlly felt like I had hope that I’ll be good enough for when I compete! The quote said “Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice” thank u very much😭❤️"
5,Gma Haz,"Just when I need a positive thought, here it comes. Right on time. I don’t have to go looking for inspiration or motivation, it comes to me all day long, right when I need it. Motivation is definitely a Five Star app with positive thoughts from all my favorite people. *****"
5,Cookie1026,"The Motivation app is excellent. It consistently (on the rate that you choose) sends positive vibes that make your day more enjoyable. I have a high-stress, demanding role and when these pop up they instantly provide a moment of zen to my packed day. Highly recommend."
3,Lauren Tron,"I love this app and got it when I purchased my Apple Watch! I loved being able to post quotes on social media as well as gain inspiration! However, recently the app has stopped working on my watch but still works on my phone. I hope there is a way to fix this issue to make the app compatible with the Apple Watch again!"
5,Azuluuuu:),"I’m so happy we can have all the themes!!! Now we can save our money. I’m sure you need money too but we can still have something. Again thank you so much for all you’ve done for us!!! God bless you 🙏🏹❤️❤️                          From,                                       A fan😉"
4,cvvvvvvvyctdg,"I really enjoy the quotes everyday. It motivates me to do better everyday and to be nice to everyone I see in the day, and at night. I hope a lot of people enjoy reading them every time get one to read. Right now I am doing the Christmas ones and they tell me more stuff of what Christmas means to people, why it is celebrated."
5,gamer_gurl828,Even though you have to pay to unlock more things you still have a chance to read quotes for free and I just got this apps to wake up knowing that there is a future and I shouldn’t worry about it just what I’m living right now.
5,praticis,"I give this a five star because it makes me motivated to do things I would have never thought of doing it, also makes me have a good mindset without this I would have such a bad mindset."
5,BreezyTPeazy,This app is a great reminder on your Home Screen or Lock Screen to keep going. If you’re struggling to get motivated or get out of a dark place - this app is where it’s at.
5,flanny330,"I’ve had this a for 3 years and whenever I feel down, I read a quote and it reminds me what I’m really working and striving to get either short term or long term."
1,goodlucky4,"This app used to be my favorite. Now, it freezes, crashes, and barely functions as it should. Also, I don’t like the addition which requires users to use the app in order to reignite the notifications. I’ve paid for the service for a year, why do I have to confirm the subscription every week for it to work? Wish it could go back to the way it used to."
5,hailey❤️‍🔥,"Honestly the best, I have used this app since forever and it places music for animated backgrounds with the quotes in them. It’s made me feel 100% better sometimes and I would recommend you try."
4,slhitchens1959,The quotes actually make me feel better.  I wish I could afford to keep the app. But I’m on a real tight budget. Disabled and had like this!! to stop working at 52!  Never thought that would happen! But I really love the quotes  I did get to read!! Need a free app like this!
5,BastardHeart,This app has helped me stay positive and overcome multiple issues I’ve dealt with for years and slowly changes my Outlook on life in the most positive way and Informs me that life is ok when you are healthy and Grateful for Life .
3,benjaminhogan,"Hi,  Love the app! Just needs to be optimized to the best functionality with new iOS version features - the widgets. If phone Lock Screen is hiding widgets, this app’s widgets are clunky when hidden if setting is on. Email me if any questions. Other than this hiccup, all is working well! Thank you!"
5,kota_96,I really enjoy being able to look at something positive and dwell on that a bit. Sometimes our worlds are a lot better than we all portray it to be for sympathy!
2,nicohtine,"I have iOS16 and was trying to do Home Screen and/or Lock Screen widgets, but they wouldn’t even show up as an option for either. I tried everything - deleting and redownloading the app, looking through the setting of my phone and the app, and restarting my phone. Not really worth paying for if I can’t use it for its intended purpose."
5,TaiHi8,I thought I’d be able to get banner notifications from the app. Does it do that? I want to be able to see the quotes when my phone is locked.
5,Debra in Minnesota,My 14 yr old daughter put this on my phone!  I’m 57 and have been depressed all my life!  This app is amazing!  I see these special reminders every day!  They help me tremendously!  I wish I could remember every single one!  Thank you so much!
3,jhene6767,"Y’all change certain categories so that on minute it’s unlocked if you don’t have premium, then it randomly locks and we are unable to view the quotes. I don’t think it’s fair to change what’s locked constantly just because we don’t have a premium account"
5,xoxojonni,So convenient and something positive to look forward to throughout the day . This probably has changed many people’s lives . I’m glad this is here to constantly put others on track .
4,Cecilio Marcos,"I saw a response saying that iOS only lets you get 60 notifications/responders or something like that. But for my ESPN app, I open that app like once every couple of months. And get way more than 60 notifications"
5,spockjwnd,The prices on this app is literally outrageous! I have to pay $20 just to change a theme or get quotes I wanna read why make an app for mental health if I have to pay for mostly everything on here $20 adds up.
5,LizH3756154826,This app is great I feel that it has helped me feel better about myself there is just one problem that if you want to change the app up a bit you need to watch adds or pay money monthly
3,kfrench9984,"I want to really like this app. But 3 days isn’t really enough to make an informed decision. If there were a monthly tier, it might not be so bad. However, there’s only a yearly option. So I’m probably just going to delete because in 3 days I haven’t seen something that will make me drop $20 and know that one feature is worth it."
5,dudeitschloe,"After doing a hard reset, the widgets work wonderfully! It even shows my custom theme, and I don’t pay for the premium subscription. Well worth the small time spent watching ads to customize it. (iOS 14, iPhone 8)"
5,LunaBear34,This app is great for people who want to be more positive and build self esteem this app should ask questions to know what quotes are the best for one person’s situation. Other than that this is an amazing app I love it thank you for reading My review
4,Pineapplebaby26,I have the app and it’s amazing with all the quotes. But for a lot of things it’s premium so I got premium. I tried to do something that needed premium. It didn’t work so I clicked the option that I had and it said that I was already subscribed to this app. So my preimium isn’t working why is that?
5,Shadowwolfangel1,This is by far one of the best apps out there. Whether it’s a notification I get or just opening the app the quotes have been helping my anxiety. The daily positive quotes no matter what they are really do help a lot. I definitely recommend subscribing as it’s worth it.
5,Ginja22,"This app gives a daily reminder, which makes you feel so much better. 100% get this app! You can even set setting for how many you want a day so don’t worry about it spamming you, or not giving you enough."
5,Haley Do,This is really helpful it helps me a lot give thing that make me happy and smile and it’s very easy to use just pay for the whole thing or Not pay but you still get reminders and everything and you motivations and yeah
5,Kashtekar,"I am rating it 5 star because though it has premium features, FREE features are more than enough and that's the reason it's been a year i am using the app and using its awesome background and quotes for sharing and posting."
5,avocadough,I love the notification feature the most because I could simply turn on my phone and boom- you got some encouraging words flashing on your screen. It truly lifts my mood especially when I need reassurance. Thank you and keep it up!💖🙏
5,DDouble74,The quotes that this app gives are constantly bringing myself to re-focus my perception of whatever I’m thinking or doing at the time. I find myself sharing multiple quotes daily with friends and family. A must have!!!
5,/ : (♡,I enjoy this app very well it gives me a positive message. The only bad part about this app is that if u want to change the background or the type of quotes you have to pay for it. Because it says the apps free but really it isn’t.
5,Doakstr,Thank you for great motivational moments several times each day.  I often pass them along on Fb and to My friends.  You make a difference in my life another lives!  Doak Turner
5,Itz_Mya,"I like this app because i feel like it gives motivation to move on when it comes to certain things, and the motivation quotes are relatable in some ways..-Mya"
5,Amiliana Young,So my cat died and I just got this game today I’ve been playing for a little bit and it makes me feel a little better so I’m fine now
5,Ezerfas,I don’t usually rave about iPhone apps unless it’s a photo app 😉 but this one is truly amazing. The amount of detail and customization is outstanding. Kudos to the development team. You guys are awesome.
4,Jazz32543,"I like the app, the only thing missing is a “dislike” button. There are some quotes I don’t like and they stick around in the widget for awhile and there is no way to switch to the next comment."
5,SmileSquad80,I really appreciate this app. It always goes off when I need it and helps me push through the hard times.  I would recommend this app for everyone.
5,usinaaa,"This app really, truly did help my life. I struggle with anxious thoughts and these helped me to take control back into my life through building confidence. 10/10 would recommended. Thank you Motivation!"
5,Momdeez,I have this app set up to assist me while I make a life change & thus far it has been right on point. Keeping me focused about several different situations. Absolutely love it!
5,MSandJS491,"Whenever, I get the urge to be down, motivation comes in and brightens my day. It’s like it knows when I need a boost. I wish I knew the price of it, when the trial is over. Fantastic idea , whoever came up with it!!!"
5,Browngod00,"The creators and all people behind this app are amazing, You all are blessings and I thank you! Words can’t describe the magnitude of my appreciation I hope you all manifest each and every one of your dreams 🧿🤎"
5,mike56192,Love this app thought it would get annoying with a constant text but sends me what I need to hear every time. Really helpful definitely when you going thru things
5,Movitanu,This app consistently gives motivational quotes at JUST the right moment. The timing is always so uncanny and is one of the reasons why I’ve gotten so far in the process of my self development. This is one app that I will NEVER delete.
1,WhoKnowZ13,"Honestly I don’t think you need to pay for motivation that’s like buying food in front of a hungry homeless old man, the most important inspirational and motivational driven quotes were given at no expense other than somebodies time and breath, the most important ones came free and you’ll most likely find any of these quotes anywhere if you know where to look and how to find it for free sorry but this doesn’t deserve recognition."
5,Blaaaaaaablaaaablaaaa,This app single handedly helped me become the positive person I am. Get those notifications. Read everything religiously. Become peaceful and happy and know your worth. You are gold
5,Mr 80s Success,"Awesome to have . Sometimes, all one needs is a kick or push to keep pressing on in reaching our goal and by just reading a quote  it may give you just what one needs ."
3,Annoyed&FrustratedAppUser,The quotes are great but since the last update the widget won’t display anything. I was able to refresh the widget and have it show quotes but it no longer displays the background or font I set which is kind of annoying…
5,MzAnti,These motivational quotes have helped me make it through this pandemic. I’ve had many days when I felt worthless but no this app wouldn’t let me.. it’s like it was feeling my pain.
5,tea_berry,Starting to think you guys are spying on me because you literally display right quote at the time it seems. Great work! I love the progression of the apps features with each release. Keep it up!
5,cindudy,I love this app because it has helped me with a lot of things and made me rethink things everyday and to take things slow and I love it I rated a 5 because it is effective and it helped me go through things. Thank you Motivation quotes! :)
2,vuelor,I downloaded this app on my iPhone to have notifications pop up on my Apple Watch because I don’t always carry my phone with me.  1. I have selected my favorite as the default but it only shows general motivational quotes on my watch and NOT my favorites.  2. The support page leads no where except to a landing page trying to pre sell the app. Where am I suppose to send support questions?
5,Kiran Khalia 🤷🏽‍♀️,"It’s helped me with depression a lot. It’s not your regular quotes, it actually motivates you to better yourself. I’ve gotten into dancing because of it and my life has gotten better, it has actually stopped me from suicide (I remembered a quote when I was about to do it)"
5,DeChata,Love love this app!  It’s helped me so much during very difficult times. It’s absolutely worth every penny! Can’t beat The quality of their quotes.
5,melanyAmadoe,This is a good app if you are going thorough tuff times I cry every night when I feel asleep but when I got this app it really comed me down when ever I wanna cry because I hate myself I deeply recommend this app because it also helps me though the day
3,Kritsh,"I was looking forward to using this app to the fullest, but A LOT of it is mostly blocked off due to the fact that you have to buy it all for a large price. It would be better if half of the stuff on the app wasn’t locked away from the user, especially to those who need it. Please think of the users."
3,the bacon man64,"So many things are locked behind a pay wall!!! If you didn’t have to spend money on most of the app, so many people would have such better lives!!! Some of the quotes in this app could make so many people so much more happy!!! Get rid of the pay wall!!! Or at least make it less money!!! Please!!! This could help people!!!"
5,wpj47,It is so great that people like this because it is great to have this when you are feeling down at school or getting bullied at school  or you get hurt at home read the things and make your life beeter
5,Kiley Anne,"This app gets me through my days!! I love this app when you doubt yourself even the tinyest but this app makes u go from ☹️ to 😀. Love this app!! Super fun features too! Super fun backgrounds, motivations, and happiness all head your way to a better day with this app!! Totally recommend!"
5,clockdock,This app helped get though the toughest times of my life. Me and my best friend went through a very rough break up and it showed me what is important in life. And now I have a new best friend that has went through the same as me and my life is the best it has ever been!
5,TiaLanay,"This app has been grand. The reminders I get throughout the day are wonderful. Just what I need to keep going. Even if I don’t open the app to read them, having them on my notification wall for later to reread."
5,LilLaz8,"This app has been amazing. At times when I needed it most, the app reminds me to keep going! I set reminders throughout the day so I can stay motivated. Everyone who truly believes in motivating themselves and reaching their full potential needs this in their life!"
5,Noah Schell,The ads aren’t intrusive and the premium version is filled with so many great features! Don’t have premium? This app lets you save all of the quotes as images. You can create backgrounds and share them to friends... all without watermarks!
4,Magadu,So I think that this app is really good but I think that about the concept of blocking some filters is not that cool because we want to enjoy this as much as we can't.Putting a side that I think that your app is really good but really think about blocking some filters.
5,Starbucks 13,"Anytime I need something that will make me feel better or I feel bad about myself, I go in Motivation and I instantly feel better! The quotes are amazing and I would recommend."
5,HenryBucky,Love love these motivational quotes. I read them morning and night. They help me meditate while I’m doing my chores and going about my business during the day. Help me to become insightful and and see the world through kinder eyes.
5,Quinniequinquin,"These have be a great way for me to stay motivated and encourage, while also making me think in a different light/perspective about where I’m at and what I’m going through."
5,Catcat catcat..1,You basically need to pay for literally everything but if you select it all of it you can get it with suggestions thingy it lets you save with or without watermark very nice app
5,👁 ❤️🐎,Whenever I saw the notification on my phone and read it I always smile it puts a smile on my face and helps me through the day. Definitely recommend getting this app.❤️
5,stevie-weivie,This app has helped me immensely. Whenever I am feeling anxious or depressed I remember to open this app and read through the quotes and save the ones that I need the most! I highly recommend this app!!!
5,Leon Noodle,"One of my favorite apps as it keeps my spirits, high. In addition, it’s like having a solid friend in the corner getting your back definitely one app you want on your phone!"
5,Kyler York,"this app has changed my daily routine for the better. i usually am trying my best to stay positive but it just doesn’t last long. now that i have this app reminding me of all the good things in life and how to appreciate them, i don’t ever have to worry about forgetting self-appreciation and how to be okay with things. huge thank you to the dev team for allowing me to be a part of your wonderful journey because you’ve allowed to me branch off one of my own."
5,Zakieya Pugh,It has motivated and inspire me to my fullest ! The daily quotes is so life changing! Wonderful experience I fully recommend this app if you are a beginner or just looking for the right encouragement this is very outgoing ! I overcame so many obstacles with this amazing app !
5,Valen1234569,I receive two wonderful quotes per day 👏🏻 I love it because every time I grab my cellphone I read the quotes that remind me of the reasons I am doind what I’m doing.   I’ve been using this app for a year and it has helped me a lot.
5,@12346Willow_panda,It makes me feel so much better about myself! Tbh it’s helped with my confidence and the way I view myself and the others around me. I think it’s definitely worth getting the app.
5,rufusbean,"I love randomly getting inspirational quotes in my notifications, it’s a great pick me up especially on a bad day. But I find most of the quotes are repetitive and not of the greatest motivational content"
4,vixillawashere,"the app is great and all but… when I go to edit and to text and try to change the opacity it doesn’t work I tried and tried and still dosent work sadly, Is this a glitch or is this suppose to happen?"
5,slakssndjd,It’s really straight forward so you know what you’re getting already. And some of the things that are locked can be unlocked by just watching an ad! So not as much money needs to be spent 10/10 love it ♥️
2,Shemja,"This was ok, but the app is stuck on the same quote for a couple weeks now and won’t rotate even if I open the app and change the quote. Don’t know if it’s the faith line or whole thing but it used to change and now doesn’t, and the “app support” link doesn’t  actually have support to contact, just info about the app. ☹️"
5,E.C 2020,"It’s a really good app. I love how the quotes are so inspirational. The background options are gorgeous, but the only thing that I do not like is how after a while they stop giving you quotes every day.  Other than that it’s a great app."
5,HEY!?!??,I really love this app because it’s tell me that l”m a important person and this app tell you really nice things and maybe things that you didn’t even know like how important you are and that you are a loved person ❤️ you need this app

5,c.money4Reelz,"I love this app. The quotes are general, but always scrambled. Never seen the same one twice. Easy to use. Simple and live that you can watch ads to get the themes. All around great APP! Highly recommend! Also love the feature of how many daily!"
5,Jazzy mamma,its bery helpful to get you through the day. it has a ton of themes and backgrounds that you can unlock by just watching a five second ad. The only thing is that a lot of things you can’t do unless you have premium.
5,Prince Cayden,This is a grat app you can Chang the icon and you you can set up we’re if you say for an example if I said hey Siri motivate me it will give me a quote from the app I really love this app you can make your own quote! So I really recommend this app for like anxiety or depression or if your scared for Cavied19
5,leslie 💕💕,"every morning waking  up to a motivation is awesome, but, in my opinion, premium is expensive. Just for some quotes, but at least we still get to see free quotes..? Anyways it’s a really good app and i recommend it! Especially if you are having a rough time."
5,MyaPapouya,"Hello, I have a suggestion. The app is amazing and all, but I'd love if I could view the whole quote in the notifications. When I see the notification, I can only see a long, uncomplete quote with ""..."" at the end. Otherwise, the app would be perfect."
5,BamaLama🤗🥳🤩,Great app just a few things I would change I hate that I have to pay for almost every thing I am not allowed to Buy anything and so I have a very limited choice  on almost everything!!!But besides that The The quotes are awesome  👏!!!!!
5,marktaylor22,Being a premium subscriber is so worth it!  Whenever I’m feeling blue  I always seem to get a push notification just at the right time.  Love the content. It’s always fresh
5,Carolinafan843,"I know motivation doesn’t last, it more of a discipline factor but just getting updates on the down days with positive quotes can change my day and how it turns out. 👍🏼👏🏼"
5,PerryThePlatypus🧢,"The only thing I would change, is being able to see the longer quotes without having to go into the app"
5,Potato_queen776,Whenever I look at my phone there is a quote waiting for me and some of them have really helped me. 100% would recommend to anyone who needs motivation.
5,Swarter32,I never thought that words would impact my life so much as these motivational quotes. It has open my eyes to the possibilities of what the mine can do for you. I appreciate this app very very much. Thank you.
5,dummy.zombie,"Seems like every time I going through a rough time or day, a notification of this app gives me advice on the situation I’m in. I love it. Feels like a sign from the universe. Thank you, it helps me get through a lot. <3"
5,Agustin benegas,My name is Agustin I’m a 14 year old boy who suffers from lack of discipline and your guys quotes have been keeping me on my grind for 2 months now I really do like your app it’s the most useful app I’ve ever downloaded
5,Millz Pitino,As a person that suffer from depression and anxiety some days are harder than others but seeing these encouraging words helps me think about things alot differently.
5,Avexplayerboss,"Every time I check my phone, I see amazing quotes that help me throughout my day. It helps me process my emotions and allows me to think more critically whenever I come across very unique quotes. I’m delighted to have this app."
5,Kiki Vance,I swear every time I’m feeling a certain type of way this app always has the best thing to say about a situation. It makes me feel better all the time
5,gsosiejsj,This app is so helpful in every way I wake up to something that makes a bad morning a happy morning I get quotes all day long and it brightens my mood and I so thank you full for this app! Thank y'all!!
4,gfghdrtsgg,The app is amazing but after 3 days you don’t get premium I didn’t get the chance to try out premium but when I wrote my first review they were really nice about it and explain it to me. I recommend getting this app it’s not personal but it’s pretty good
5,Hoorayjf,Appreciate the Motivation App as it provides a daily positive juju jolt for each day. It encourages you to think out of the box which we can all use. Highly recommend this app.
5,church band fantict,This app is suprisingly good I got it hoping to get some quotes relating to Jesus I don’t like how you have to buy a pack to get the rest of the quotes this app is supposed to be motivational why do we have to pay for motivation this is a complete scam
4,Funnyturtles,"I love checking my Apple Watch for a good quote to refine my mind for the day, but the watch version of the app won’t change the daily quote when it’s on the watch face. How do I fix that or change the quote that shows up? It’d get a better review but I’m tired of just looking at one quote."
5,Grandma gone crazy,"This app was just an afterthought but I could not believe when it popped up at just the right time as I was feeling down...its not intrusive, bullish, nor demanding.  It's smooth as satin and silk with just the right amount of wisdom. Try it...you won't be sorry!!!"
5,Dj Chel,"I live the motivation app because it literally motivates me throughout the days. I always share it to my social media to motivate others because I feel we need to motivate and lift others not tear them down. Thanks for this app, it is fantabulous!!"
1,MLopez5020,The app was upgraded in February 202 and now the user is forced to watch an ad to unlock themes or backgrounds. This can be very annoying from the user experience and will cause more users to remove the app rather than paying for a subscription. I hope they reconsider this strategy of forcing people to pay for a subscription or be annoyed and waste time watching an ad just to unlock a theme for what appears to be 24 hours. 😤
3,Kmonte84,"Love the daily boost of positivity however, half the time I do not receive my notifications. All setting are correct. One week I will get them the next week nothing. Once I go back in to check the settings I start to receive notifications again. Not worth the time/money"
5,Killintime91,I’ve had this app for a few weeks now. It’s amazing how much just reading a simple passage helps. I recommend this to anyone that has gone through something dark or currently searching for help.
4,ahahsush,"In the Apple watch,, we can't read long quotes in the notification bar, then if we clicked on it so we see the whole thing, it shows another quote.. That's just in the Apple watch I think. Other than that the app is too great I hope that would be fixed"
5,M3GB,"I love this app, it’s great at work and keeps me going throughout my day, also is helpful on the weekends too. One thing I wish I could do is change the tone? Maybe in one of the updates? Thanks for taking the time to read this. 👍🏻🤘🏻✌🏻"
5,Sytiran,I love getting these motivational messages on my phone from time to time. Sometimes they come just in the perfect moment. They also gave me new backgrounds to choose from just for having the app for a long time. Much appreciated!
5,Jojo78903,"Love these motivational quotes! I use them daily start and end my babies (13 and 17y/o) day/night!  It’s such a great way to build self-steam, mental strength and a self coping mechanism to help them on a daily basis. I deeply believe the more positive motivation we generate it will make a better world for the younger generations!"
5,Tripp044,This app was truly helpful to me whether I was having a good or bad week. The quotes included related to my life and current situations and truly helped me have different perspective and positive viewpoints each day!
5,Ainablam,"I love this app Even though I don’t I’m not on it, it give me many but not to much notifications helping me be my best self and improving my mood. I never have seen a better app than this!"
5,Nizz🤍✌️,I get anxiety very easily and stress but I also always want to feel positive and this app really change my life I guess but yea I like this app and know I will always have it on my phone.
5,xSaiya,"I love this so much! I love the different categories, the zodiac quotes, and the push notifications seem to always pop up exactly when I need them the most"
5,A77##,"I really like this app , the Quotes are beautiful.  We all go through things in life and it is refreshing , motivating and gives me some hope that things will get better 🙏         I doubt everyone is perfect nor do they have lives of perfection. We are all human and go through things unbeknownst to others . So you have to try to be positive and do your best to see good in things . ❤️       We all struggle , some of us are just better at hiding it . 🥸"
3,A person that hates the game,"Love the app, helps keep the vibe positive. I set it to where it sends me quotes everyday about 4 times a day, so why does it ask me after a week if I want to keep receiving quotes, if I don’t turn it off, it should continue until the end of time ! I appreciate you 🥂🖤"
5,luk3yyz,"i love this app internally, it has boosted my confidence a lot because these quotes are what keep me going. however, yesterday i had broken up with my boyfriend, and as i was doing so . . a quote popped up. it said “the most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting you are special too.” i’m not going to lie, it did make me giggle a bit. either way, i love this app a lot and i recommend it to people with low self-esteem/confidence."
1,BaniyaJi,While I understand that advertisements are how free apps earn money. But this app just takes shamelessness to next level. There are ads at every possible place. They cover your screen and sometimes just don't even let you take a screenshot. Apps like these force people to use Pi-Hole and other ad blocking technologies. Ads shouldn't be in your face and certainly shouldn't cover content.
5,asaberitat,"This app is very good, it lets you choose and mix your own quotes, after I got this app I feel good and fresh and it helps especially through a rough day, the price is well worth it."
5,Tbemt,I love this app! I get the notifications several times a day. I take a moment to read them and meditate for a moment. I have saved so many of them. Wand I share with family.
1,SoulSinger47,"I downloaded the app and paid for a subscription for one year and did not receive a single notification. Now that my subscription has expired, I’m getting multiple notifications within the hour. When I click on the notification, it tells me to renew my subscription!!! Wow. I don’t know if it’s a glitch or because I’m using iPhone, but this app never worked for me."
5,BarrelPants,"This app is (so far) glitch free, and has amazing encouraging and inspirational quotes! We could all use these reminders that we are capable and strong and amazing, whether they are computer generated or not. (-:"
5,izz@tennor,So this is a great app. It boosts ur confidence. It’s an amazing app. I love it but...... I don’t think it should be 4+ I was just in the app and it said 3 bad words. It’s still a great app I just don’t thinks it’s for kids so I think it should be 12+
4,Xander Patel,Love this! Quotes are so motivational :) one tiny tiny issue is the adds. I get why there are ads. I’ll ❤️ one and then I won’t have an ad but the I scroll down to the next one and an ad plays before I can even read it. Otherwise I love it love it love it!!!
5,favorate yoga app,This app really does help me get through my stuff. I love the option to have widgets and they tell you how to do all of it. You have the option to select what you want the quotes to be about so they really help with what you’re dealing with.
4,real name here,"The quotes are good and fairly fresh as I’ve heard some before but not all, or at least not in that specific wording. I like it so far, just not sure if pay $20 a month for premium is worth it, but to each his own."
3,Dog787,"The good news is that it delivers motivational statements to you in your notifications, though most of them are rather mundane.  The bad news is the video advertisements. Not only do they take over your screen, they scream at you as well. Imaging being on a video call when this happens."
4,JuliaMores,"Super awesome app love the quotes so much!!! I think that maybe though you guys could make it cheaper. I don’t want to spend money to get more quotes and stuff, and I also don’t want to watch two minutes of ads to get backgrounds for the widgets. Otherwise though I love this app awesome quotes and very inspiring!!!"
5,krdavks,I love this app so much. I put it as a widget on my homescreen and it looks awesome. I really enjoy reading the quotes & I live getting inspiring notifications. I even looked at the other apps from the developer and downloaded those too! (Like facts and vocabulary). It’s a great app!
5,ashleyy1987,Love this app! I love that it’s customizable to what types of quotes you want and how often. The quotes always brighten my day and I get excited when the notification on my phone comes through. Amazing reminders and sayings to help support an optimistic outlook on life!
5,Josefina E Valenti,I swear this is the best app for anyone. Even if you’re not going through something hard. I went through something very hard with a bully I thought I could never forgive and I hold grudges. I get annoyed with her still but this app helped me climb out of that dark hole!
1,HoneyBxo,"So I downloaded this app and ofc its a subscription/premium app anyways you're supposed to get a free trial witch I took and then cancelled it in my subscriptions but was charged not only was I charged for a subscription (Even tho I cancelled in more than enough time) but I download the app again same iTunes account same phone but the premium version I was charged for wasn't even given to me.  Seriously a sketchy app just go look at motivational quotes on google,seriously."
5,Harry Edward Styles is mine,"I loved this app! It helped me during sad times even though everything was locked I still found quotes that made me feel happy!, thank you motivation you helped me get back on my feet and back on track!."
4,Wolfy=3,"Hello there! I noticed that you can add your own quotes, and I was really happy about that! I like the app and everything, but if you’re able to write your own quotes, you should let others see it, not just yourself. Because what’s the point in writing a nice quote that nobody’s going to see?"
5,paypay1pqge110,"As soon as I got this app it changed my life! Before I got this app I was really sad , stressed, insecure , and I thought I was ugly! 😭 But when I got this app I felt so gorgeous, loved , confident, and happy!!! So my point is this app changed my life for good thank you for this app I am so very grateful! 😁"
4,ivytrondd,"Whenever I’m sad, lonely or getting bullied, I go to this app and I get inspired. I fell stronger then ever it helps me get through tough times, it helps me know what and not to do and I love this app for that I’m giving five stars it helps me become a better person. Thank you."
5,AlisonAndrea17,"I love this app and how spontaneously and miraculously sends me messages when I need them the most. Every single one of the quotes is perfectly curated and fills me with inspiration, hope and energy.    I recommend this app to everybody regardless of your emotional state. This apps will bring a  smile to your face every day. Who says no to smiling and laughing more ?   Get the app you won’t regret it!   Thank you Motivation you have saved my life and my says and brighter and happier because of you."
5,Lizzzzzz10,This app has done wonders for me. To wake up every morning with a quote that I can shake my head up and down to because it speaks to me is awesome. I have told friends about this app and they love their motivational app too!!
5,Misshighgear,"I really like this app, Sometimes the motivational quotes comes to my phone just in time throughout the day when I really need to hear positive reassurance. Positive thinking can really change ones life for the better. #Thesecret"
5,Eghenobowan,Hello Admin!  I want to say this quote mobile app is the best the whole world and my whole family have it in their various phones via me. So please l will want an upgrade to enjoy the whole features of the app. Thanks Pele.  Hope to hear from you soon.
5,lalaboobah,This app is life changing. When I’m having a bad time it’s so great to tap my phone and see a motivational quote. It’s a constant reminder to be better and I really enjoy that!!!! Also it’s great how you can adjust how many you get in a day. Keep it up!
5,Lillypadfoo,I truly love and appreciate this app so much. It’s kind of crazy but I feel like it just knows the perfect things to send me at the right times. Highly recommend these quotes have really helped me for quite some time now! Keep up the great work guys💜✨
5,@nks1713,Hi! The most recent update has slowed the app down considerably. The app has never crashed before and is now crashing on me. Can you please look into this?
5,saul_mendez_,This app really helped me in my thoughest moment in life. Absolutely recommend! Ngl there’s a lot of times I mentally was going through things and the help somehow caught me in the right moments I needed it most!
5,hffhb CSS gh ff has go Mandi,I woke up on Sunday starting fresh felt good and planed a new diet new motivation and stumble across the app it gives me as much motivation I will ever need in the future to get me threw the most 5/5 5 stars amazing spp
5,Marjorie 🫶,I love the way it gives me quotes from what I tell it I’m going through motivation helped me a lot in my daily routine so I give this a five star and also it’s comfortable and not weird or uncomfortable
5,Paris!🩷🩵,I swear it’s like y’all stalk me bc every time I do something bad or something bad happens to me they always bring up something to help so tysm y’all changed my life around also y’all make me so proud of myself!!🩷
1,Carmenyippie,Many of the quotes can be easily misinterpreted and create “toxic” mindsets or at least I personally believe that. I think some people were trying to be inspirational and wise without the experience or wisdom to back it up. Wisdom is universal yet the quotes definitely depends on the person reading them but there are some that I can appreciate. I would just be careful and take everything with a grain of salt.
5,killupfillup0,I’ve had problems for a while and after using this it gave me a boost and I cannot thank the person who made this app enough
5,ushsjdjdbdhjr,"This app helps me so much. It helps me get through my day and, if you’re like me you are trying your best, you know that you need a motivational quote to keep you going. So this is the app for me !"
5,sendrell,"It’s the best APP!! help you out thur your day ,when you’re having a hard day .when the motivation graph  pop up ,it help your day go by smooth and better also brings more peace ."
4,mary1496ocean,I thought I would be able to listen to small talks about life’s lessons. All I see are little sayings which after awhile are just little sayings. I really wanted to listen to people and their sharing of wisdom. Very disappointed. Very.
2,lovely lee lah,"It started off positive the first few days but Now It says things like “ The moment that you start to wonder if you deserve better, you do.” And “ Friendship isn't about who you've known the longest, it's about who walked in to your life, said ""I'm here for you,"" and proved it.” I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MOTIVATIONAL. Seems more like it’s trying to put you down and get you to argue with you people! SMH.."
4,Nahrhs,This app makes me want live a bit longer every time i see quote it’s amazing and so inspirational although it doesn’t give that many free options . I am a 16 year old who doesn’t have a job and i am not spoiled but other then that it’s awsome
5,jazyyyybooo,Crazy how whenever I feel sad or whatever the case is this app will send me a quote right after I have those thoughts and then I feel like I’m gonna be fine after all
3,arutoskey,I opt out of pay how do you offers something then say your charging 40 month for something you can look up online? I gave no approval to be charged and have checked my phone to make sure no subscription was charged. I love quotes but not enough to pay!
5,grgrhfj,I had this app for two days and reading all these quotes makes me feel better about myself and makes me want to try harder and helps me forget about the past and that h the e future is now
5,jaina cathers,I love this app. Sometime I get my new motivational quote at exactly the right time. Other times I didn’t know I needed it so badly until I saw it. Helps me to take a step back and see things from a more positive light!!
5,BobbieJo114,I love that I can have a motivation set for everyday at a specific time. I make it for 10 am so while working it can gives me a little positive motivation for rest of the day 💚
5,limelifejoni,"I just installed this app, and agreed to the terms, and as soon as I try to open the app, all I get is a blank white screen.  I’m not happy!  This means I’m going to be billed in three days and I cannot even use the app!"
5,aubreygreen927,I love this app so much the idea just makes me so happy and i love the way that it is set up. Even if you don’t pay for it you can still just watch a short 30 second video and you can get that type of quote
5,awilliams99,"This app has 10/10 helped me in my everyday life, but the only con is the premium subscription cost. I would love to see a cheaper lifetime option & I’ll be quick to purchase"
3,YAY SHEEP,"I love this app a lot! Like let me tell you, it brightens my day when a get a notification from this app! Just, is it really worth paying money for a better experience? I’d say you shouldn’t need to pay or watch adds to unlock stuff but if your willing to pay then, sure!"
4,hit hugh,"The reason this app doesn’t get a five start rating is because of how you have to pay for themes and more. Some of the types of motivation people may need, they have to buy. Some people might not be able to buy that..."
5,sprajwala,"This app got me through finals week.  It is a clean application. Although the free version has advertisements, it doesn’t interfere with the purpose of the app. I like the fact that we can choose what type of motivation we need."
5,ricog24,"Love this app. Just what I was searching for when looking on the App Store.  One issue to fix is the widgets capability, change it so that the daily quote will stay fixed on that quote rather than change every time I look at widget."
5,Dr.Walker07,This is the best motivation app I have ever tried. The surprise prompts throughout the day always seem to come right on time. I also like the ability to create wallpapers and set my own font and background. Highly recommend!
5,Guardian Butterfly,"I don’t read them everyday day but I try. It’s good to hear something wonderful and motivating to start my day. I even share the quotes with my friends, specially when one rings true with something they are struggling with.   Thank you!"
5,Point of View,"Some days are just one let down after another. Just when you are ready to throw in the towel, you get something that brings hope alive and rejuvenates your belief in yourself."
5,Cookie Monster 0520,This app has changed the way i feel about life in general because it reminds me I can not control everything
5,Tacky the cats,This app knows what’s up. It will be the app that stops you from making a decision. I’ve been using it for years and I don’t leave reviews but it is my favorite.
5,Pretty_Lane,"Update - still not working! Even after most recent update. Whatever was done, pls undo it -thanks! - management"
1,F- No,"This app means well but it isn’t super thoughtful. It will give quotes that do not relate to me and are very triggering. I’ve tried selecting what I want to see and every-time it never works. Also some quotes are dr Seuss then it will change to drake, then it will encourage you to have a baby. Too random. Just not for me. This app is good for someone that hasn’t had anything occur in their life and are able to shrug off some of the sayings."
5,@ChuyRMX,The best app you will find for any type of motivation. I been reviewing apps for the last 9 years on the radio and this is simply the best app I have found for this purpose. Download!
5,thelegendzion,This app just knows when to deliver the right motivation at the right time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for motivation throughout the day or looking to spread positivity.
3,Court031386,I’m getting quotes like “Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels.” What type of body/food Shaming motivation is that?  There have also been motivations that are insensitive to mental health or are just generally bizarre given the purpose of the app.  I suggest you consider these issues before considering a quote motivational.
5,Atlcarrots,It helps me get stuff done and get over things when I am going through a tough time. ❤️❤️❤️
5,Åšê,This app has more than helped me mentally and I remember when I was being so negative about life and things in my life and this app just had the right words when I did.
5,👑💯,Personally I think it’s super cute with the themes and the backgrounds and stuff. I also really like putting this app as a widget on my home screen because everyday it changes with a new quote! I love this app so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
3,Gabsjdor,"Good app, but I used to be able to make my own and post it to instagram and other social media using my author name at the bottom of it, but does not work for this version. You have to add it to collection before posting it. Please fix. I’m paying $40, I could go somewhere else."
5,Devon137,I just want to say thank you for this app. I’m going through a very rough time in my life right now. This app has helped me push through every step of the way. So thank you sincerely!
5,Sndboy_,I really appreciate this app. Remember me. My name is SNDBOY pronounced Sòund-Boy. I aim to create a song inspired by how this app has helped me. I’ve only been a user recently but it’s a great addition to my day. Is there an email I can contact when it’s time ?
5,The lil burnt chicken nugget,"So I saw this app a month ago and I was like: why not give it a go?  So, two hours later, scrolling through quotes, spamming friends, it helps me fight back my sadness"
5,t.hfai,"It really helped me since i downloaded it , but in my country i can't pay for other categories and it's my major problem in every situation ."
5,fantastically convenient,This app provides quick access to daily motivational quotes that I can read and be inspired and also share on social media in a very easy way what a wonderful app
5,Jacy Perez,"Every day In the morning, afternoon or night I read the little notes and give me a great motivation e inspiration for keep going in my professional career or my family life. I really recommend it to anyone. Thank you"
1,aannddrreewwmaarriinn,This app was great!.. At first... The quotes we’re inspirational and motivated me as I Had downloaded the app for that reason. The second day the app wasn’t great anymore and not motivating me anymore. And suddenly...I want  cancel my subscription and the app had already charged me when I only got the free trial and took all my money from my account. I Better RECIEVE ALL MY MONEY BACK or I will have to take this to cooperate!
5,GCello,I think everyone could be passionate about something. The fact is this has been the most educational and motivating app i know of. I believe in self control. A person must learn how to be confident about speaking with honest.
5,Manny Pit,"Is amazing how is sharing hope, faith, perseverance and so much values to help everyone using this app many options if you want to save it or If you want to be part it, you can upload your inspiration too"
5,treesh4,I had a lot of sadness break my heart and so I let take the best of me and so if Martin Luther king had a dream and he was a black man I can have a dream to and share to people because it all about love and trying not to make other people feel the same
5,F4d3r,But they do.  Look over the version history. Feel lucky I was blessed to get a lifetime version of this.
5,-luke mccalib,"This app is great, it will consistently send you positive quotes and uplifting messages. Currently I have the free version, but when I do have extra cash I’ll more then likely purchase the paid to support the company! Thanks for the amazing value guys!"
5,Bekah Cain,I wish it could have ways for us to design our own backgrounds and choose and for us to be able to comunnicate with only others who have the app only through the app.
5,Martha Flake,"I wanted to start waking up with a positive attitude so I downloaded the app and I wasn’t disappointed. Also throughout my day if I need a pick me up, I read a couple of quotes and it sets me back on track! Thank you."
5,Merrrkdjsnad,Thank you for this motivational app. It sends me the perfect uplifting note several times a day and always seems to come at the perfect time. It’s like God whispers in my ear every time I get one!  It’s the best!!
5,Nickname 54637,Motivation is a great app for people who are going through something or people who just need a little motivation. This app has helped me boost my spirits and it helped me to think more positive thoughts
5,Zaidey parks,It’s a good app but I think it can have some adds about it because it’s such a good app so I think it a have a few adds to get more people to get it for more encouragement.
3,BranMan03,Although I enjoy this app I must point out the consistent failure of reminders some times the reminders just stop till I open the app again after it’s been a while. I have it set to remind me twice a day yet I get way more than 2 notifications per day
5,Billy BobbyJo,I absolutely love this app!!! Whenever I feel down about something it always sends me a quote that is about what’s going on with me. It always send me the perfect quote at the Perfect moment in other words!
5,slugslinger1,Hey this is the best app ever I have downloaded it and I am so happy to be able to use it and I love it so much I am so excited to get it back to you thank you so much for the opportunity to share it
5,Angei 7853,The app worked good for 3 days when it was free. After I paid fir subscription nothing else happened. It just quit sending messages.
5,Mindysocute123,"My life has changed because of the quotes this app has given. I thought it was the end, but it was just the beginning."
5,Olivia.2008,I have never had a app that I actually love. There quotes are funny and always put a smile on my face. My friend always laughs with me when I get a new quote! And they always come at the right time.
5,Lynn Quach,I love this motivation app it real helps me program my mindset to be positive! The quotes are inspirational and true to help us stay on course. I recommend their apps to anyone looking to calm their mind and set the tone right for the day🌷🌝
4,MzClark26,When it is displayed as a widget the background doesn’t update.  I can change it but it will go back to a black background and not keep the background I changed it to. Please fix
5,Lovemexis,"ok this might sound stupid but these daily quotient kept me going. Even if they are cliche, I can always relate to them and use them to push myself toward and have a better outlook on life :)"
2,wpbdude,"If they didn't keep changing my settings to allow their own content.  I've approached them about this numerous times before: the problem seems solved for a time, and later their stuff creeps back in.   It seems that I will have to delete it and find something else."
4,depresed person ✌️,"This is actually making me tear up and see how bad my mental health is, my self esteem, and many many more. I just don’t like that you have to pay. But besides that this is really wholesome and very nice."
4,tealz fox,The app was great but you had to watch a video to do the theme and my phone won’t update so I was looking for a widget app and you have to have an iPhone 14 update to do a widget but other than that it was good. The quotes have helped me through hard times
5,CapnCrunchh,"It is really nice to look over and see a good quote, most things cost premium but it still gives u the option to watch a add instead"
2,Cheryl RN,"I don’t know what’s happened lately, but the quotes have gone from sounding inspirational to sounding bitter. For example, just now it said something like “the only people I owe my loyalty to are the ones who never made me question theirs”. That isn’t motivational, that sounds like someone made you mad. There have been a lot like that recently. I’m about to delete the app. I don’t need more negativity in my life."
5,Casimirin88,I get notifications in the morning and some of the quotes will be right on the money either reflective or situation I’m in. Some days it really does help give me motivation to get through my day.
5,Coach Webber,Thank you for this app it helps me spread joy to others life’s around the 🌍. During My podcast Elevated Thought$ I read quotes from your app. For those that may have Needed that motivation.
4,mayou1234554321,"This app is very good the only reason i put 4 stars and not 5 is because you gotta pay for practically everything and it kinda makes the app pretty boring at some point. Besides that, I really recommend this app, it made me feel better about myself and more confident."
5,JPur1209,"LOVE everything about this app! The theme customization, the various categories, the ability to set a time range to receive notifications & how many times a day! Well done!!"
5,mayaa💞,Thx a lot for this app it helps a lot I do wish u didn’t have to pay to save them but I love it and it’s worth paying for in 11 and this app changes me a lot it was recommended by my mentor she said it would help and she was right thx a lot 💜
2,amazing but……didin't work,"This is an app to help people getting through thought times. Not to make you spend all your money! Headspace is better. I’m glad my aunt doesn’t work at a place like this. I swear, I came here because I am depressed and I have anxiety, not to spend my moms money. Like, literally everything is locked!"
5,Mec250,Really enjoying this app and reading the many quotes plus the advantage you can add your own. Awesome design with well  thought out package.  Well done. I recommend to anyone wanting to read inspirational messages.
5,catlovergang,Before I download this app I was like this is not going to cure me from bad days. But then I get used to it and it has been a very good help with my daily life. Strongly recommended app! Thanks! But I get through without paying which is a good thing.
5,Soluco,"I absolutely love this app it been really helping me whenever I thought of my crush and she never liked me back, I usually when I’m down i open this app and spend a couple minutes reading it"
5,Perk05,This app seems to always send me just what I need every time I am going through some of life’s curve balls! This app sends some great life changing advice to keep my hope and dreams alive!!!!!! I thank God for this App!!!!!!!

4,hope4real,"I gave it 4 stars just because I think this app should be free, that said...I like this app a lot, especially in this period of time with everything going on in the news. It’s nice to have a little quote of inspiration pop up on my phone throughout the day."
3,Milo-the-Dog,"The free version is good. I went to look for a different category but others are under a payment plan unfortunately. And the category for Mindfulness has a hand gesture that doesn’t reflect mindfulness at all. It shows the “shocker” hand gesture(two in the pink, one in the stink). It’s sexual in nature. I don’t know if it was done as a joke or what but I find it very inappropriate."
3,Aliciabcp,"I used to absolutely love this app and the pleasant reminders I would get texted throughout the day. Lately they’ve been almost negative. I’ve tried adjusting filters, but they’re almost downers. Bring back what this app used to be and it’ll be stellar again."
5,chevygirl11261990,"I’ve only had it for a few days but it’s already helped me a lot. So far, I’ve been able to relate to all the quotes I’ve read that where sent to me 🖤❤️"

1,kaenickname,"What used to be a great app is seemingly in the downward spiral. The text no longer fits in the widgets, and it always tells me to ""open the app to refresh"" instead of just giving new ones like it used to. It freezes quite a bit and I can't click anything without a new add popping up. I'm a long time user of this app but I think it's time to find a new one!"
5,ImAWholeVibe,So many times I’ve been going through it and open this app and my whole mood and energy is uplifted. This is a necessity for me. You won’t regret it!

5,NOBS🙂🙃,This app is great for reminding us about the good moments in life even when bad moments rear their ugliness. Many times it’s the little things that keep us on track or help us get back on track when we’ve been detoured...
5,Molly7365:,"This app helped me so much with my anxiety, this app gives you a whole new perspective of life. It helps you understand life. One feature that I love is when it warns when an add is coming. You should totally download this app it's life changing."

Thank you for the beautiful work. I can feel it’s done with LOVE and wanted to share my enthusiasm and gratitude. Namaste. Audrey
5,Arithethick,You have to buy a premium which means the better quotes and etc.. and only comes with a few options to choose from. If it was all free I bet this all would be off the chain!
5,Lillian Carter,I have learned to really like this app over time. Just getting on it every now and then just to read some quotes has helped me come to believe that this is not only a useful app but also a very true and supportive app.
5,I love motivation,I have been depressed and wasn’t encouraged to do anything at all. Now I’m working out from 5:00 a.m. to 6:30 before school starts thank you motivation.
5,karen and 4 kids,This app has genuenly helped me become a more positive person. Just seeing something that reminds you to be positive can change your life.

5,beth3change,"This app helps me stay focused on my outlook on reality, attitude, thinking positively, and has quite frankly changed my quality of life. Thank you to the developers for making it available."
5,bb123456$67,Every day and every hour I always get a inspirational quote. When I’m having a bad day these quotes get me through the day. Just remember your not alone! You got this!
1,Brutally.Honest.,"When I first downloaded the app, there was at least some themes that were free and unlocked, however now every single theme except for the black basic one is locked for membership! Outrageous and dumb, this app has gone to complete GARBAGE. And you can’t do anything without an ad getting in the way every 5 seconds. Would rate 0 stars if I could."
2,crableglover,"I love the idea of the app, I think the amount and variety of quotes is great. However motivation is not available for Apple Watch faces anymore. I have an Apple Watch Series 7 after I upgraded from my series 5 and it is no longer an option. This makes me not even want the app anymore. Please fix this bug."
5,AnonymousCat1234567890,"It looks like the creators put a lot of effort into creating motivational quotes. And it’s awesome you can play an ad or two to change what the quotes look like, instead of subscribing."
3,i_kevin8,"I just don’t care for the quotes. I don’t feel inspired whenever a new one pops up. I was hoping it would be a nice way for a mood boost, but it’s not working for me.   The app is very well designed though. If you like the quotes, then this could be a great app for you."
5,jerimiah white,"Downloading this made me feel so good and calm now and I’m going antisocial but I Feel like I can listen,watch and share how I feel about everything"

5,Pinkydoe247,"The quotes are great and all but now they’re not free, and you have to pay 20$ a month for quotes. If I don’t pay then I have to read motivational quotes about things I don’t even need!"
5,chartreuse 11,"This is the first review I’ve actually written in EVER!  Motivation keeps me inspired throughout the day. My thoughts are more positive, I have more gratitude, and I’ve increased how much time I spend towards my goals each day."
5,badbih6915,I’ve had this app for like 5 minutes now and I’ve been going through a lot it’s already given me so much things to think about and and helped me realize how much stronger I rlly am and it’s helped.
2,slcAshGM,The quotes and memes are amazing the reason for the two stars is one even with the yearly subscription price I should NOT have to go into the app every single day and reset my reminders  What exactly is the point of the app? If I have to go in every day and reset everything that’s unnecessary work and just an extra task  It shouldn’t be like that
5,Taylor B. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾,"I love the way the widgets have the quotes change on my Home Screen. Daily reminders to keep going and stay strong when in times like now all you have, is to truly work on mental strength!"
2,mrosetep,"I used to love getting these quotes daily, but I noticed a few months ago they suddenly just stop. It takes me usually a couple days to realize so I open the app up and it says “new reminders scheduled.” I’m not sure why it pauses and in order to have them again I need to open the app. It’s pretty annoying. Otherwise I enjoy the quotes (when it works)."
4,hanish13,This is an Amazing app!  You should probably fix the play sound button because it is letting me play multiple sounds at the same time if i click on it twice or more by accident
4,MC.BOOB,The quotes are amazing and they really make me feel good about my self and help me get through the day. except i wish their are more options u can choose from that are free and does not require money but aside from that i would definitely recommend this app 💕
5,chjxxjtdifcfidtsjx,I give this app five stars. If you are going through hard times it is amazing. Plus there is a premium option but you don’t have to buy it and you can still use the app
5,Dignity ur,I never write reviews but this app is one of the reason why I feeling better every single day ! Thank you for all your amazing quotes that make me love forward and become stronger
5,521Danielle,Sounds corny and I know it’s always coincidental but I constantly get quotes related to what’s going on in my life and even if everything is going fine it’s nice to get a little boost throughout the day. 10/10 recommend for anyone! 😇
5,missnicky1,I look forward to my daily reminders. I’ve had this app a while now and I love it. I should have decided a long time ago to pay to unlock all the features!
2,KirkLott,"I used to love this app, but it has changed for the worse. It used to have great quotes from notable people, now I think they just make this stuff up. Also it is very annoying that it has been turned into spamware, where it constantly redirects you to other apps, to try to get you to buy them. I do not recommend this app at all."
5,Monarch 7,"Thank you for in powering my mind, soul and spirit to place way beyond the thoughts and desires I have for myself and others.  Self-respect and self-love is challenging towards the way others treat me, talk to me, and believe in me."
4,Club member,Rather lame that if I want to search by theme or just change the font I have to pay *monthly*!! Maybe a one/time $2.99 would be ok but monthly??? For that???  Nope. Otherwise I would’ve given this a 5-star. I do like that ever time I open the app I see new stuff.
5,Rebeccabecaroo13,"I can’t say enough about this app. I love reading and writing quotes. It’s someone’s words that explains what I am feeling and this app is perfect for that. Thank you to the creators, you all are perfect!😁"
5,Divia,Helps me with depression and anxiety.  The quotes and videos really keep me moving toward positive goals   While they aren't a replacement for counseling and medicine they are a wonderful and uplifting added bonus.
5,Blue bell ice cream is so good,1)it has so many options and how you would like thinks  2)it's just so amazing no other app could do anything like this!!
5,brodnasty246,"This app did wonders for me during one of the most difficult times of my life, constantly reminding me that I was worth something. 5/5"
3,Topper89,"I really like this app and find it useful, however I noticed recently that my widget has been showing the same quote for days…even after I scroll and find a new one and also not in the language I have set the app to use."
5,DJ00790,The motivation quotes really do help. Even when I’m having a bad day. They also make me realize there’s more to life than being stuck in a scheduled lifestyle.
5,mandoito,I’m not gonna lie and I’m not a Indian scammer either its really nice honestly and I’m glad I got it but can someone please help me soo I could just get them nonstop for some reason it stopped on me at 3:38

5,Haddasa,HOLY CRAP! this app is amazing... takes up low storage.. very encouraging and you can customize the app and style to make it ✨your own✨ loving it so far. don’t second guess i love it and you will too!!!
5,"MULCH MART, CEO",I have enjoyed this app. I have found the quotes to be on point and well placed. It appears the developers put a lot of thought into how this app works and what it says.
5,AboutAnwar,I really admire the people behind this application.

5,Friendly friend123,Before I got motivation I felt badly about myself but after I started using it I felt like I was good enough. TheQuotes on friendship are fun to send to someone who’s down.I recommend motivation to everyone even if you don’t need it.
5,MMAHAN12,"I love this app! Even with the free version you can personalize the types of quotes you want. The frequency of new quotes appearing and the chance to favorite them is so nice. Also, choosing the theme for how your quotes appear is so subtly beautiful. I adore this app, it is incredible!"

3,carlee4657,"I really enjoy this app because I feel as if I can relate to a lot of the things they are quoting. But, I only get notifications like 1/4 of the time. And I have to always go back into the app to like reset it or something. It’s weird. I wish it would notify me all the time but it doesn’t for some reason."
5,Princess fairy forever,I really need help to get motivated and stay on track. These are great short reads that gives you a reminder to stay motivated. I feel much better when I’ve accomplished something.
4,leateq,"I would love to buy this app forever like other apps, I really don’t like the idea of subscription and I don’t understand even why it’s here I know you have to support this app and update, but just release a paid “dlc” packs"
5,Queen twinn,This app is for optimimists like myself to help encourage pessimism in others.  I think it’s great with Daily Reminders.  It even has a schedule you can set accordingly.  I look forward to getting my daily reminder. 😃
4,peanut*6,"Hi there, I’ve been using motivation for quite some time now, and really love the app, although I do have a few comments.  *The app says it is 4+ but I have noticed lots of quotes that have inappropriate material and swear words, I don’t thinks it is necessary.   *Also, I’m not willing to pay for this app, is it possible that this could be taken care of, or at least give us more to choose from.   I thank you so much for your time and dedication you have put into this app to make it what it is so far, keep it up!!"
5,Sondraxox,"I love this app. I receive a quote 3x a day and look forward to each one! They keep me motivated, inspired and remind me to stay thankful/humble. When I’m feeling a little down or having a stressful day at work this app truly helps! ☺️"
1,Jhorse99,So I got this app to help me with anxiety because I need a lot of reassurance. The app was great At first and I had premium. Then my phone broke and when I got the app on my new phone there was no way to get the premium back. That means I just wasted avi 90 dollars on something that didn’t last me two months. I haven’t been in the app for a long time but when I opened it I noticed that EVERYTHING was locked. In the end this app is useless and helped me none.
5,Addi Best,"I’m so glad to have downloaded this app today, after reading few quotes I have just realize where to start from if I really want to achieve something. It’s good to have this I bet."
2,jeacnk25,I bought the entire years subscription and was really happy with it for the first month... then I’ve had issues where it doesn’t send anymore. I keep having to go back into the app and reset my reminders... disappointing for how much was paid for this app. Really wish I could just set it once and not have to worry about it.
5,sPiRtE cRaNbErRy,"I’ve been through dark times and sometimes I just need a little something to lift me up on to my feet. Every quote is unique and you can make your own to help inspire other people. Overall, great app!!"

5,Circle4lofe,Before I was always thinking Nd how horrible I was and not being able to do anything but every time I see a motivation on my phone it keeps me moving pushing on without worry and have a better kisser. 🥰😍😁☺️🤗❤️👍
5,Anointed P,This App keeps me going. The motivations are amazing. Anytime I’m feeling some type of way just in time a motivation pops up and it keeps me going through out the day. I love this app so much I’m gonna recommend this app to my parents
5,keira hyder,The only bad thing is you have to pay in order to get quotes from certain groups which is really annoying. You can get only like 5 of them unless you lay to unlock all.
4,vsndbdbjebe,This app is amazing because when you are feeling down and sad these quotes bring your mood up to happiness because they give you quotes to give you confidence in yourself and it also gives you a happy mood for the rest of the day. So keep it up!!!!
5,Latysha Lyn,I really enjoy this app. I would purchase the whole package if there was a discount for disabled people. In my condition I find it particularly helpful with difficult days and times. Its even given me a new appreciation for my phone Lol

1,Rob02190,"I have been using this app for a couple of years now and I have been a subscriber. But no longer the app lately has been flakey, unreliable and crash prone when trying to launch. I have reported it numerous times nothing has changed, and no one has ever reached out to trouble shoot the issue. Never able to launch so unable to contact directly."

3,Dj Animation,This app was a 5 for me until a recent update. I’ve had this app for a few years and I lost all of my saved quotes. I’m unable to save any new quotes and I cannot see past quotes I’ve read. Is there a glitch? Hopefully this gets resolved soon.

5,Mir707,This app helps me so much on the daily basis it helps me get through the day I don’t know what I would do without this app. I’ve told my therapist about this app and she has referred it to all of her clients.
1,Jyangofett,"I've been using this app for about a year and when ios14 came out, I was even more so impressed with the widget handling.   After a recent update, I can't expand a quote displayed in a widget or notification. The ""sign up for premium"" banner overwrites the quote and then I lose it. Make using notifications and widgets pretty useless and really ruins the experience of using the app. Really disappointed."
5,cocoaxbutterfly,this app is perfect to find quotes that can cheer you up through hard times. it has so many themes for free and a lot that you can do without paying for it. love this and totally reccomend

4,Acct: itz_oceanna,"this app is amazing. it truly is. i love all the motivational quotes. sometimes, quotes pop up on my phone at the perfect time. like one time, i was going trough something, and it popped up. love that. but one thing i dont love is the locked stuff. because i feel like we shouldn’t have to pay just to get motivated. and i needed quotes about a certain topic, but it was locked. and im not spending money on it. but i just want to ask if maybe you could make some free? or make all of them free?? :) thank you for reading. have a great day!"
5,brentgrab,Very timely. Almost as creepy as getting random ads that seem to listen in on your conversations lol. Excellent quotes that help put pep in your day and give you a little peace and hope when down.

4,Stop the control,"I really enjoy the app. I mainly use it for the daily quotes. They are really great pick-me-ups throughout the day. The ads start getting more intense after a while and a couple quotes didn’t make sense, but overall it’s really nice."
5,Acegaming101,"Some of the quotes don’t really stick with you. But, the right quote at the right time can change the way you look at your life."
5,s.h20,I will never rest or be at piece until I can figure it out. Now that we know that I was right from the start. I can duplicate the events to cause a reaction

3,tjs17771,Having issues trying to change the notification pop-ups on my Lock Screen. But I can’t contact support to figure out how to change the subjects being posted. Looked everywhere. 🤔
4,Professor OG,"Good app with motivating quotes, some of them even come at times where I needed it.   Not too convinced of the whole monotheistic mentality so I’m putting it down because of that craziness.   Other than the whole GOD quotes integration, it’s a decent app."
5,DancingHeart78,This app has already helped us out for more than one problem I have been trying to make up for this year! I love it so very much!
5,Remus3,"Thanks to all the members that created it, you guys save a lot of lives. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Once again thank you and God bless you all."

5,heavennnnnn worl,I really love this app every time I’m feeling down I hear my phone go off and it’s this app telling me I could do it and stay strong building me more higher than I already feel I love this app ❗️
3,Optic millionaire,I've set my theme to the same plain black background several times and watched the ads to get there but for some reason EVERY time there is an update it resets and I have to rewatch it.  If it keeps happening I'll just go to another app. I'm not watching silly ads for no reason.
5,nnnnnnnaaaaaaaoooooo,This app actually motivates me but I wish there was a way that we could see the past motivation quotes Incase we missed them during the day and didn’t get to read them. But it’s still a good app.
5,livelovelight17,"So, I stumbled across this app and now I absolutely can’t live without it. Everyday 3X a day I get a quote that just seems to fit perfectly on what I need to hear or remember in my life the result is balance, gratitude and clearer thoughts.  Thank you and keep em coming..."
5,Jadayas,"I am just starting the app and it is like you read 1,2,or,3 a day you just swipe and I don’t know the rest but this is like a therapist but not really I love this app"

5,Black Eyeshadow,The app helps you with multiple thing to get over. I went through a break up and thing thing helped me so well! It has amazing quotes!
1,way too controlling,"You all make this thing un usable. The constant pop ups, you try your best to get your little logo in our screenshots when it ruins the aesthetics of the picture. NOW my widget won’t give me a quote unless I open your app first? Stop trying to force people to take certain steps. I’ve had it with this app it’s so controlling. I’m deleting this app. It’s not motivating it’s FRUSTRATING."
5,AkiraHis,Honestly it just helps when I’m half asleep getting ready for work to get a nice message I try to take them all to heart to help me thought out my day♥️
5,heaven sent1,Every motivation verse describe the well being of living in society the negative the positive the good the bad the worst but you have to adapt it will always be better days

4,eden chevelle,"I love this app so so much. But whenever I use it for at least 1 minute and get off, it lags my phone severely. It’s never done tho, only recently. It started in about December. Other than that, this app is so great and uplifting. 🧡"
5,Ishibug,"This app is the greatest! Everyday it gives me inspiration and motivation to keep going. I love how it incorporates my name into the quotes, it makes them a lot more personal. Thank you.  Aisha"
2,Dan657854,"After owning this app for 11 months now I can say this app is filled with fairly low quality quotes.  With over two thousand years of human history and famous people, this app chooses to publish whatever your drunk best friend would tell you at 2am.  95% of the quotes are meaningless and not profound as much as the author tries for it to be."
5,edm_kitty,I love this app a lot I can write my own quotes and my support friend whenever I needed. Thank you very much it’s really helpful for me always sending me quotes in right time. ❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼
4,AlQahir,The reason this is a four star app is because you have to pay for some things. But other than that it is great.

5,NicoleCollins1224,"Love it!!! Great app seven day free trial. But in order to access themes and different other things if you pay the $20 each for year of the quotes, you have to pay $20 for your town like the themes???🙃"
5,Jessica Busey,I love this app so much. It fills me with positive thoughts. I use this app when I am stressed and when my friends say negative things about me. I feel so much better now that I use this app!
5,Spagonni,I love your site your motivations coming up on my phone every day really helped me so much thank you

5,Reseryuhfdedf,i dont think that u should have premium for all the other quotes and stuff. U shouldnt have to pay to see depression quotes and things like that. Im not depressed but for others who are they may feel bad.
5,Kenisnotonfire,This is a great app that has made me open my eyes many times.  I have no problems with anything.  I have depression and anxiety so this has been somewhere I go to read some inspiring quotes on life.  I suggest this app to anyone.

1,Heat1175,"I was enjoying the app until I got one that said, “Nobody cares about your problems. Work harder”. The next one was, “No one cares. Work harder.” Will the next one tell me how to tie a noose?  Second review. I just got another one that is just mean. I’m deleting this app and I hope others do too before it does any real damage to someone’s psyche.  Someone needs to be proofreading your proofreaders!!"
5,martymix32,"I started reading daily motivation at 18 years of age, today at 50 I continue.  Since finding this app I love it!  Especially love the reminders throughout my day!  Quotes are amazing!"
5,elizaketh,"This app is rlly good, when I’m on my lowest of days it helps me get back up, the only thing with this is, there is not a lot of free stuff in this app but once u find stuff it amazing"
5,Daddy Said,"I love the constant, original reminders. Positivity can be hard to keep up sometimes but these little bits of inspiration are priceless!"
4,Boo346846,Love your quotes but wish you had a one time buy offer so you don’t spend 💲1 something a mont ( that builds up with other things like bills) and like $20 a year that’s too much.   More people might like your offer if it was a one time buy.
5,InkieFrmTheBlk,Now this app is amazing and definitely helps most of the time..one thing i wish it did have is for you to chat with someone who can give you personal advice
4,kaishaandrus,"Purchased this app last year and I still have until aug 2020 to use. Switched phones and it won’t let me restore my purchase. Gives the portion to purchase a plan with ease but when I click on restore, it won’t open smh good app tho."
2,Danube029,I am highly disappointed that in order to have a theme you have to pay for this now. I was always happy having basic options and now apparently to have any type of theme I have to pay...such a disappointment because now I’m going to have to find a new app for my motivational quotes. Stop thinking it’s only about the money
5,NessyDArmeza,I honestly really like it it my first time trying this and hopefully I can write more about it but as of now I like it is inspirational the word of how it connects to you or anyone else that you thing that it relate to.

2,KarolCow,They have good quotes and I like getting the notifications during the day but If you don’t click right on the quote notification I can’t ever find it again. I go into the app instead of clicking on the notification and the quote is gone. It’s VERY frustrating especially when it’s a long quote so the notification doesn’t show the whole quote.
5,alanpaul🙂,Well I really love the quotes and the motivation it gives me everyday the motivation quotes it’s been giving me these past few weeks are amazing they are making me feel really good about myself I love this app ❤️❤️

2,sggpawlly,I have a pay version and still receive ads to download other apps. I sent them a message and they didn’t do anything about. The messages and app are great but don’t understand why there are ads with paying version. Not satisfied about this.
5,amclueless,"This is a great app and thank you for the daily inspiration, but is there a way to flag any of these to now show again?  Or perhaps a thumbs down option?"
5,roddigue,Makes you feel better when you’re down.
5,Mocha Jaay,I love the daily motivation within the quotes. It’s like they know exactly what you are going through because the quotes come at the perfect time.
5,adhd reviews from me!,"Whether you’re trying it out for free or paying for a membership, I suggest this app. There are great quotes that haven’t been played out on social media yet."

5,leongloria799,"I can use all the motivation I can get. Probably the most intense chapter of my life. Everyday is a challenge but I know I will survive hurt, bruised and all."
1,mnzbu,"This app is a brilliant idea for reprogramming the mind, but it’s only downfall is that the notification do not work as intended. Despite the deleting redownloading, restarting iPhone, re-enabling notifications you name it etc etc, it will send notifications as intended for a few hours then won’t for a few days then back again for a few hours etc."
3,petersonsavanna,It was great when it would actually send me quotes as a notification which I asked it to. If you don’t click on it or go in the app for a couple days it will stop sending you quotes. If they fix this then it would be a great app!!
3,Awphoto1,"I paid for the year, I liked the trial and enjoy the little messages throughout the day. I’m getting the same handful of messages though, over and over again. I’m bored with it and I’ve only had it a few weeks."

4,@sun_yah,"I love this app! It’s like I get istracted during the day in all the details of life (and of course day dreaming too) and this app brings me back, at least most of the time, to what’s really important. It’s words of wisdom passed on by wise people"
5,bintouthegreat,Really helpful sight when you’re feeling down. Even when you’re alright that alert multiple times a day just brightens up the day :)
4,Craftee Kiwi,"I love this app. Some of the quotes really help me get through the day but for some reason the quotes change like every 2 days on my watch :/ So when I go to look at my new quote, the old one is still there, i still love it and i love how it blends in on my watch"
5,Trickyteeta,These motivational messages have turned dark days into a smile.  They make me THINK!  They turn around how I may feel into something positive.
5,Journey82~49,I love the different quotes! Some I have saved to use as images on my devices! Thanks for the inspiration!! Sometimes I see ones at the right time:).
5,@AVANI,This app is so good if you are looking to be motivated or inspired. This app has so many wise words that everyone should hear. You can also customize the quotes to fit what you are looking for!
4,skxusbxjsbdj,"If I’m ever in a bad mood I literally go to this all and read some of the poems, definitely think everyone needs this app. My only problem is you have to be a member for some of the items but that’s fine. Highly recommended!!!"

5,hailey_sprees,"This app is amazing! I love getting little quotes in the morning to get me motivated and ready to take on the day! Only thing I don’t like is how when you do the time, in the minutes it’s either :00 or :30 min"

5,I in love with a monster,This app help me overcome depression and anxiety be four I was so fat now I’m really skinny and one day I sort of feel in love with this man and the app got my heart to tell him and now I’m married
5,Daiquire,10/10
1,Hannahluna12,"I loved this app and the quotes were great, you USED to be able to customize the quotes based off ones you liked or categories.  Now if you don’t pay for a subscription you get the same generic quotes on rotation everyday.  Used to be great until you had to pay for any other category besides “general” like really…  Deleted."
5,Clo_isn’t_perfect,So the reason why it’s a 5 star review for me is bc it helps with my self-esteem and tons of other things but I’m not listing it all I would recommend it
3,jdjfhdjdkdkfjdjdhfufjfjj,I love this app but there is one thing almost every time you favorite a text there and an ad and every like 5 scrolls there’s an ad and like to do most of the types of texts you need premium I wish there wasn’t as much restrictions or ad’s 😭😭
1,Mia1xo,"I pay for the year subscription i love the quotes. I keep them on my lock screen widgets and home screen widgets that’s how i interacted with the app. For some reason the app says the lock and home screen widgets are available, but on the other hand it doesn’t even show up under a selection to add a widget to lock/ home screen."
5,wrirmte a review,This app really helped with my mental health by just picking what I need help with and then reading about five quotes a day it made me feel so much better about myself
5,KylaBrown7,Honestly this app helps me in so many ways. Even if I’m feeling down they always find a way to bring me back up
5,Annalycia5666,It’s helped me achieve a lot and this app helped me through tough times but no matter what it helped me and helped me stand up to my challenges and bullies
5,Paigevolleyball@25,"I love seeing these type of apps that start me off on a good mood in the morning or if it was a rough day, reading these to make me feel better. Thank you so much!"
5,hf gf fnfgn,I got this app because i was mostly feeling bad about myself and it made me feel happier and it makes me feel like im meant for this whole world
4,Jenns Cell,Great app! At least it was now when I open the app or open the quote it starts letting a clicking sound continuously going I uninstalled it because it kept making that noise .
5,csgdhfjgjgjbdbdbdv,This app has helped me get over my depression and finally be able to make friends and enjoy life overall.
5,My rAteS😁,It really just makes my day and makes me happy I do recommend using this app for anyone who asks but it just makes my days😁
5,nikasantos1990,It’s always on point put up at the right moment when I need a good uplifting sometimes I feel like it’s a message from above..
5,Jordan889911,"When I open the app the first thing I see is a quote that will always make me smile, especially when I feel said or mad."
5,loveless life,I just recently split up with my fiancé and these motivation messages have helped me feel a lot better! Thank you 🥹
5,pos52,This app is by far my most important & favorite one. It has helped me in ways I can’t even explain. Very easy to customize. Well worth $20 a year. I love LOVE LOVE. Thank you ❤️
5,PrettyMK1,"Honestly, not sure how the daily messages match exactly what I need to hear but this app is magical.  I highly recommend it as a gift to stay calm, focused, and confident. Thank you!"
5,fh h k F x bgsb,This app can really change lives. It affected me in many different ways. I highly recommend trying this app.
2,StevieMarie8,"I want to love it, but every time I pull my phone out, the quote on my home screen is a white background and random quote in the same ugly font. I’ve tried everything in settings and it’s just not working. Even paid the $20 for an annual subscription."
2,MsShyStar,"This is a great app, but it hasn’t been working properly for the last couple weeks. It sent me a “happy Friday” quote and today is Tuesday. It sent a Sunday text yesterday (Monday). It also has been sending me morning quotes at night. It seems like the app is no longer recognizing dates or time like before."
4,Childofgod3000,"I really enjoyed the free trial. When I decided to purchase the subscription, the reminders decreased to not even receiving anything. Thanks."
5,thatkid631,I wish I didn’t have to open the app every day to reset the quotes for the next day but other than that awesome app love it
4,Miguel J. Aguilar,"I feel the motivation when it pops up on my watch, gives me little updates throughout the day.   The one downside I don’t like is when I’m on the Watch, it’s hard to go back to a REALLY good quote."
3,TheAlyG,The only reason I’m giving it 3 stars is the fact that there’s why to many ads. Every time I have a quote pop up an ad comes righter after it not even 2 seconds in before reading the quote.  Other than that the quotes are amazing.
5,Hdjejskan,"This app has really done a great deal of help and everytime ive felt down it throws a quote tht just helps uplift me. It helps keep on a positive mindset with quotes that teach valuable lessons or help you see situations differently, love it!"
3,DL.net,The app’s not bad - a little expensive for some quotes but overall I would have given it 4 stars except one major problem - WHY IS THIS APPLICATION PROMOTING QUOTES ATTRIBUTED TO CRIMINALS Like Jordon Belfort - Seriously - Good cause to boycott them.  Don’t buy this app unless they remove their propaganda suggesting life criminals and scam artists should be viewed as a role model
5,cmpcreative,"I have loved everyone of the inspirational quotes and they come at just the right time, as if the universe is speaking to me through the app. Thank you for providing constant inspiration!"
5,jw7tlc,"Whatever management & team they’ve put together I’ve done a great job.     • Their attention to detail for customer use is evident in the intuitiveness.     • Everything works as you would expect.   If I were judging all my apps, it would be 1st.       • The cost to value proposition is, 90% for value….leaving 10% for zero complacency, quality control & to ☑️ each others work.  👊 + 👍👍"
5,WanderingDude,"This app is so good, the quotes are always on point and have impactful meanings behind them. If you want a pick me up use this app or better yet make a widget on your home page like I did."
4,Pugmaster00,"I just downloaded and paid for the app. I’m excited to see the motivational quotes, but when I went to setup the widget the app was not listed. I even reinstalled the app and had no success. A bit confused and frustrated."
4,Christopher Farkas,This app is truly Helpful. But it should merge with iCloud Drive so we can transfer data to other devices. That way we don’t have to keep re-downloading and starting all over.
3,neigerf3,I loved this app until the widget stopped working! All I get is a black box with lines and no quotes unless I touch the widget to open the app. Tried everything! 😭 The I am app works just fine. Totally bummed that I upgraded & now it won’t work
5,callmehparker,I love this app because I put it to where I get them from when I wake up to when I go to sleep and it keeps me going through out the days! 😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😁
5,JENSWEENEY,This app has actual purpose. It’s something I’m often checking because the inspiration is there. The reminder of humanity is in this app. I love it.
5,x.authentically.mixed.x,"I have never been so centered in my life! I was so stressed before downloading this app, thinking that I couldn’t get anything done and that it was all hopeless but this app helped restore my confidence! Definitely 5 stars!"
3,MsNessa,Most of the apps in the App Store are listed as “in-app purchases” when there is a subscription offered. This app appears to be a free app but it’s use is limited without payment. I was surprised to see that features require payment. It should be listed accordingly.
5,InvisbileBunny,I’ve only had this app for a couple days and it never fails to make me feel better i always get notified with the right quotes at the right time i love it ❤️
5,Anamusicfreek😝,This app is amazing when I’m stressed or having a hard time I look at these quotes and I feel way better I recommend this app so much especially if you are sad or stressed✌️❤️
5,ryleyy:),This is app is very much so recommended by me. Somehow i always got the right motivation when needed which really helped more then anything. It helped me reevaluate situations and how i take them and such. Recommend!!
5,mckennaloulil,"It really helps me get through my hard time and I never thought something like this would. So for those that are skeptical, give it a try."
5,alegra_thao,It really makes my day to see these positive things pop up on my notifications. They always make my day even better than before!
5,00dances,"This app is so great! It doesn’t have any technical issues, but more importantly it does its purpose. You don’t need to buy a membership for it to work, I didn’t and it is one of my favorite apps!"
2,A very upset ex- wishbone user,"I really don’t think this app is even worth it.  I mean, you could easily get these quotes on the web for free.  These quotes aren’t even good half the time.  I don’t hate this app, but I really don’t see the purpose.  I know it’s cool to get notifications throughout the day that are supposed to be “motivational”, but I’m pretty sure everyone’s already seen these quotes on Facebook or Pinterest."
5,rjunef333,Little dopamine kick every time I pick up my phone and there’s a notification with a quote. A few have even inspired journal entries. Motivating and gets me thinking with high quality/cerebral nuggets of wisdom. Many thanks!
4,bailey channel,"The app is really cool I like it so far, however I just hate the fact that you have to pay for certain quotes or whatever u want to call them. If the app is supposed to help u why am I going to pay."
5,Bria_26,"It’s should a small concept, but really helpful. I’ve had it less than a day and it has really helped me. 😌 It’s given me a good peace of mind, I recommend it to everyone. What do you have to lose?"
5,Kayylen,Some days I don’t wanna wake up in the morning but getting reassured by waking up to see my daily quote is amazing.  Life can be crazy and sometimes you just need guidance and that’s exactly what this app does and I’m forever grateful... GREAT APP BTW
5,RlCKSanchez,Been struggling with this life thing not I’m a depressed way lol but In a financial/no motivation to do anything way. Even having a notification that helps something cross my mind is beneficial enough
5,johny0987654321,"App is excellent, but when I 1st got it, it had a beautiful blue background for free, so I believe it should go back like that, with the blue inspirational background instead of a boring black, then more people would download the app."
5,lsg47,I love this app because it helps me understand that I am not alone on this world and there are things to help me all my life. This app is really inspirational and has changed my life!! I definitely recommend it 👍🏻👍🏻
5,Ethan martinez,"This app has been a lot of help for me as I am going through something’s in my life I never thought I would. These words have truly help me and others, to get through just the day."
5,Vampgirl89,I love this app. I love motivational quotes. I didn’t try the free version went for the full paid version because you have so many more options.
5,By... Who?,I felt it... they made me happy and sad- it’s worth it. Sometimes you’re just in that certain mood and you want to read something. This is definitely the place to go. It’s worth it <3
5,SycamoreKid,I read daily meditations every morning. Sometimes I’ve forgotten what I read by noon. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I love that I can take literally 10 seconds with this app to help get back on track.
5,Michele336,The quotes I’ve seen are too long. Repetitive from the everyday quotes. They should have grief quotes to offer. Being mindful of survivors and victims due to life trauma. They are extraordinarily pricey for what they offer.  “Ego is Greed. We all Bleed the Same Color”
5,Motivationspeech,"I felt so much better after seeing the motivation quotes, I feel better and in the future it will even help me more!"
1,Nbdy$,"I’ve loved this app and even subscribe to it, but with the new updates this app is harder to navigate and is slow to open. I’ve trouble shot and it’s the only app I have issues with. The copy text was removed and so if you want to use a quote to encourage, there are like four steps just to share it. I was happy with this app."
1,113577533user,"About a month ago I tried the free trials for this app and forgot to cancel it. It ended up not mattering because i thought it had cancelled on it’s own because I deleted the app. Nope. Turns out, I changed my payment method today and it immediately took 30 dollars from my account. App is great but not the random charges."
2,neatdudeson,"I keep seeing the same quote over and over. As I actually disagree with this quote, I’ve muted two words in it. And yet! I continue to see it.   In general, i’m seeing the same few quotes.  This may be because I’ve only selected a few topics though. So this one might be on me."
5,Sword Keeper,"What I love most about this app is that it sends me in Motivation right when I need it. It’s not like the motivations are mind blowing, but it just feels nice to have something. Remind me of the positive moments."
4,Angie_][#,I bot this app to see little words on my wallpaper and to see how I am feeling good about my self but the fact that u haft to pay for it I don’t know and i can’t seem to get it on my walpaper
5,taniyacole18,"Whenever I’m feeling sad or just need some positivity, his app says all the right things .. i just wish it was like this when talking to people! Lol"
5,Briyele,I love this app so much I just got it and I’m feeling better about myself this app is a 10/10 I love it it’s going to help me through so much. Thank you
5,kundachola,"The app is called motivation for a reason, and that’s because it does just that, really helpful quotes and as well mind blowing ones(in a good way) 🙌 really love the app"
5,garnergirlie,Reading these quotes makes me feel grounded in life.   Sharing them with my intimates grounds our relationship.   Thank you for making my life more serene happy and joyful.
5,let go elite member,"This app has changed my life. So positive and encouraging all throughout my day, especially when I seemed to need it the most ! Thank you"
5,liv the cutest,"This has helped me a lot since I write a lot of quotes and send quotes to my friends, but it’s so hard to fine good one but this app has all the quotes I need"
2,Toyonrocks,The quotes are great. Then when I didn’t buy more they started trying to trick me into downloading spam. Authentic looking Apple pages stating “your iPhone storage is full” or “malicious software detected” very shady and disappointing. Had lots of potential but that really turns me off to anything from this developer.
5,daddy uhh,This app every time I open it has something to say that I need to hear it’s a big pill to swallow sometimes but it’s worth it
5,kalv2022,What a great app to have and motivate you. Many different themes that you can choose from and it always helps my day be better I just love it 🥰
5,Darnell 33,"Real review I love this app , it just pops up at the right time an gives me that extra push to continue my day seriously"
5,Kahyireh,"Really Dope App, didnt want to pay for it at the moment but I seen the value & it’s definitely worth it. You will also see the merit, everyone needs someone"
5,swamp nama,I really look forward to seeing my “every day. It is the first thing I do when I wake up every morning.
5,Aaliyah. s,This app gives me motivation and keeps me thinking positive. The Siri Shortcuts are really helpful when you need a quote right off the bay and I think this app is great for everyone.
5,OfromMN,These quotes have more to do with self-esteem and are great for getting through a breakup. Maybe that’s just for me based on what I have “liked”. Either way I love it! Thanks!
5,Worship303,Perfect timing it’s crazy how you say it to yourself but when you actually see it makes a world of difference much appreciation❤️
5,jayjaythegod2009,This app really helps mentally and physically. Just by putting certain words in a sentence makes peoples day.
5,Meg Winks,Great content to boost spirits in good times and difficult times. The app always seems to deliver apt motivation in moments when I most need it. Thank you.
5,ToyaJ89,I absolutely love this app and the quotes are so meaningful. They help me out more than you’d realize. I will continue to use this app everyday and take in the messages
5,Magic todo,I found how to do monthly subscription and the app is working again got me.  Love this and I love sharing the quotes with my friends every day
1,Sonny7225,"I really love this app! Unfortunately, it has stopped working on my watch. I haven’t changed any settings. It either shows incorrect quotes from my favs, it freezes on 1 quote, or it doesn’t come up at all on my watch. I’ve troubleshooted all the suggested fixes and nothing works. If I’m paying for this app it should work correctly."
5,itskellz!,Honestly really brightens my day and I think we can all use a little bit of encouragement and positivity in our lives ❤️ amazing thank you
5,OMG so mad and disopointed,This app is so helpful. My parents are going through a divorce so it’s really hard so looking through this app is so amazing. Plz download if going through a rough time or just want it again this app is amazing!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
5,R3X13,"I love this app even without a membership. It’s so easy to use and I love that you can change the app icon, and the background, and it has widgets!"
5,DLJG63,"I enjoy the wide variety of inspirational messages that are provided for free, which is especially needed during these stressful, challenging times."
5,JaydnJenkins,This app and my grandmother are the only things keeping me strong right now I’m going through a very tough time so it’s nice to know I have two people on my side if things get wild. 🙂
1,Sherica Redrick,"When I first downloaded this app it was great. I was able to view the quotes and add the ones I liked the most to my favorites but now when I open the app, there’s an ad that pops up that won’t go away. The ad is asking me to upgrade to premium. Is the app no longer allowing free access to quotes? I will be deleting if the issue isn’t resolved soon."
5,Avaeddy17,"Helped me through my ups and downs am reminded me of things that I did not want to forget this one hit me , “it takes a strong heart to love, but it takes an even stronger heart to love after being hurt”"
5,almaryhar,"I really like this app the fact that if I feel down  or something not going right for me, I always get a motivation notification that can literally make my day !"
5,ash or ihasdertermination,Ok before we start I just wanted to say it’s not 4+ but is still a great app!!! I love this app so much it works and I love how you can change the theme and how the app looks. You should download it.  Ok bye!!!! <3 <3
5,Gloria Maduson Ruiz Mischel,When I am sad or not I use this app everyday I read up to 60 quotes then I told my friends and the once they forgot about our plans
5,MGfamily,I have been trying to break the habit of digesting the daily news cycle.  This app has helped fuel me with motivation (and helped in my parenting and leadership moments) as I try to get better each day.
5,Red zooms,"I love this app, it seems like it knows what I’m going through because almost every message it sends me seems to corresponds with what I’m going through."
5,Mari Rave,This app is AMAZING ... I mean AMAZING... it’s so life accurate I mean it’s creepy how accurate this is ... no matter what situation you have going on once you get the quote you will automatically feel related to the topic and you will feel HOPE ! I swear !
5,kcote1981,I have this set up to give me notifications through the day and it always seems it know what I need to be told. It’s always right on time!!!
5,App finder,Great app. It will be great to have same quote running on your tv on Apple TV version . One can leave it Apple TV on and instead of Apple TV screen saver quotes from this app should stream on tv
5,AmyB8484,"I absolutely love this apps. It has great quotes, and having them pushed to me at various times throughout the day is a nice pick-me-up. I like that there's a wide range of quotes and you're not seeing the same ones repeated."
1,charliesmama09,I paid the yearly subscription and I am still seeing the lock symbol on many of the items. When I click on one of them it tells me I have to pay for unlimited option. I even tried to pay for the unlimited again and I get told I already paid. I paid but there are still locked symbols on items. Doesn’t make sense. Don’t buy the unlimited version.
5,Art937,"Enjoy the app, however just as a suggestion more motivation topics/ areas should be unlocked vs having pay. This will give the customer a little more insight on what’s types of quotes are provided"
5,perfect mind set,I have always been a negative person but once I got this app I was able to wake up to a new quote everyday that would always put my mind in the right path. Positivity .  I’m
5,emiriee,I have alerts more than once daily and it is always able to take me out of whatever stress I’m in and reminds me of what I’m working for and what I want in my life. Thank you!
5,honestreview4u101,Seriously one amazing app! The update is amazing and allows you to have various of option. On roof of that the daily motivations MAN OH MAN what a difference in your day it can make with a small quote! I ESPECIALLY love having it as a widget for the iPhone! THANK YOU
2,Kk:/,"When installing the app it’s obviously free, but once you start to use it you realize everything is locked. You only have a few fonts and background (all backgrounds available when installed is plain black). there’s no point in the app being free if you have to buy all the fonts and background. BIG waste of time."
5,Daish3,This app is so great I just wish we could unlock different categories without paying ☺️ I read through these every morning and it starts my day off great !!
5,Avery Meraz,This feels like therapy and if you are feeling sad then you could go to motivation and it can makdd Ed you feel better
2,jenne310,"The ap is not what I started paying for.  It no longer pops up with the times I have set.  It takes minutes to load.  It never comes to my watch anymore.  Paying for an ap, and idk what is going on, but the last few months have been terrible."
5,_natthalii,"Each quote I get through out the day has been really helpful and what I needed at that moment, really keeps you motivated"

5,JAYDENDOESNTEATA$$$,This is honestly the best app ive ever had on my phone. so thankful i found this app and so thankful for the person who made it. it helps me get through alot
2,u dont really want to know,I loved having this app as a widget however the most recent update added a black border and it ruins the aesthetic for me. We should have control whether we want a border or not.  I may discontinue using the app if the next update doesn’t allow us to have the option of no border
3,mcfinnish,"This app is great for some of the positive things I’ve seen however, there are some things that are… odd. Especially when given the timing of when I receive them. Is there someone I can discuss these oddities with?"
4,Yossieb,"I have just been scrolling through the App Store when I saw this app  I saw you can just download it and it’s free so I just pressed it and got it  I am now looking through the app the first time and I know how SO many people need this but have  no ways to get it ,no time or even they don’t think they need it  I think everyone should have this app because even if you are perfectly fine you should have tiphis   IT REALLY BOOSTS MY DAY"
5,Catlyn Vickers,"If the post doesn’t apply to you personally, you’ll know someone it will touch and possibly help during their troubled time 💕"

3,IvonneCatherine,"Love you guys but I keep seeing things like “Don’t love anyone who doesn’t love you, stop wasting your time w people who doesn’t love you” etcetc and I find them very negative  Just talk to me nicely and tell me positive things that dont make me go like “huh?” 🤣 I don’t know just my humble opinion lol"
5,aimeebeanie313,I love this app it really keeps me going and I share to my kids and family sometimes social media also. Very encouraging and inspiring

5,😈😈😈😈💜,It shouldn’t be 20$ a year to an alert on your phone but I support the whole app it’s really motivates me some days to even get out of bed
5,Addison~Addie,"I’d have to say this app is really good, I’ve had it for a couple months now and I’ve had a lot of progress with being happier! :)"
5,lovedwellbyjerry,I appreciate the daily reminders of positive thinking .... I'm picking up the +attitude!  I would like a few more of quotes of work productively or even house/yard work over relationships.  I would recommend !
5,There she is_there she goes,"This app is so worth it, and worth unlocking all categories. Positive reassurance really helps a person, no matter if they’re happy or sad, better get through the day. Simple reminds go a long way."
5,Special Thought,This has been my treat in the mornings and throughout the day. Especially when I have my down moments. Reading it lifts my spirits. It feels as though it knows exactly how I feel.
5,Bigboypedy,I love everything that this app is about even when I’m at my lowest it left me to see things different thank you so much.🥰🥰🥰🥰😍

5,Riley Rodriguez,It helps me through my hard days and it really hits different for me so I think for everyone that needs some motivation needs to download this app
5,orhskapw,It really helps me get through my day when I need it. I love how it sends a new quote every 30-45 minutes. I have a Apple Watch so i will just look and it and most of the time it’s a quote!
5,Omg_Ronnie,Download this app  If you feeling Down. You could buy specific quotes  but I just use the main quotes they have a good supply of them. Just download so you can see what I’m talking about
3,Taint squeeze,"It’s a great app, plenty of motivational quotes. However the daily reminder tool doesn’t seem to work correctly. If you open the app itself the daily reminders start coming to my phone until the day is over then the daily reminders stop showing up"
5,Sutz187,"Really love this app! Only thing is if I get a notification with a motivational quote and click on it I can’t get it in big to send forward to someone else, but other than that, love it!"
5,gigglebox38,I love this App! I suffer with depression and anxiety and am enjoying the positive phrases! It’s uplifting especially when I’m having a bad day! Thanks so much for making this app! I wish I could give more than five stars!
1,DinaMoore,"I just bought this app 2 days ago and realize it is not what I’m looking for.  I have been trying to cancel my subscription and get a refund but no one will respond and  when I put my reason for cancelling in, the system came back and said that’s not a good reason for cancelling so my request would not be honored.  Great “motivation “ on their part wouldn’t you say to refuse a cancellation/refund to someone?"
5,Book_Worm 2006,This app is really good and I shared some of these quotes with friends I’m so happy that I got it. When I first got this app I was really low on self confidence but it helped me a lot. Now I have great self confidence!. This is a definitely must buy
5,Unicorn_Queen Lover,I give this a five star when I am having a hard time I just read some quotes and it makes me feel much better you should really get the app
5,TLBHui70,The quotes disappear after awhile and I can’t look back to see what they were.
5,kkcampa,I set the reminder up in the morning and trough at school most of the time the quotes are on point and get me through the day I totally recommend.
5,FraZierHughescom,If you enjoy great quote this app has them and they are consistent and will motivate you and make you feel good and hope you change the way you think in a more positive way! #hughesorlose
4,AnnaSias,"Can’t search, can’t look at any categories, can’t  even look at multiple quotes at once, without paying. I’d like to see more of the product before I buy like I can with other quote apps."
5,Nicki poi,👍 and also I have to say about that but it’s gonna want me to say more but I don’t really have anything else to say so that’s all I’m gonna say today bye-bye have a good day
5,kristinasale,Thank you for these beautiful  motivation messages. This helps me a lot bcs my mom passed away and i don't recieve her motivation messages anymore 😞
5,niquedamn,"I love the motivation it gives me, sometimes I be ready to give up until I see the quote that it gives me throughout my day."
4,BroMango,Love the app but recently the widget stopped changing quotes. I tried deleting the widget then re-adding it but now it just stays blank. Hoping a fix happens soon!
5,Sarebear🐻,I give motivation 5 stars because they help me realize I should think of the good stuff instead of bad stuff I 💗 motivation

5,jenniferrrrrrrrrgrace,"Thank you, I’ve had this app downloaded for 5 minutes and it’s already helped some!"
4,zadie12345,I have two of the motivation widgets on two pages of my home screen. But how do i make it so it’s not the same quote on both pages? i would like them to be differnt.
5,Cee I,"Most people I know wouldn’t invest (financially anyway) in something that’ll boost their mental health such as this app. It really does make a difference for me,combined with exercise/sekf-care. Thank you! 🙏🏽"
5,yeapitsme210,I really enjoy this app!  The quotes show up on my screen as a widget and seem to be exactly what I need to hear at that moment. THANKS!!
3,SeeleyCat,"There are a lot of excellent quotes out there. Unfortunately, the quotes in this app are disappointing mediocre.  Given that, and the awkwardness of adding in one’s own quotes, I find this app to be way overpriced.  It is not a good value for me and I will will not be subscribing for a second year."
5,TiaTheRiot,I love this app because I get wonderfully motivating quotes of encouragement all through my day. It’s like having a positive friend on my watch face.
5,smhhbvgj,I love this app it really has helped me with a lot of things.. this app makes me feel powerful and question everything I do in life

5,Yankees fan01,"Definitely worth the money, it really gets me through the day. Thousands of quotes that I love reading on my Apple Watch when I’m working. Thank you guys!"
5,KarenKatt64,It’s helped me in my own way of getting through the days when I’m really being guided in a negative manner. I think everyone should have this app
4,214drew,Yeah it’s got some pretty cool quotes. Better than scrolling through Instagram all day to find good motivational all quotes for te day.   The app is pretty easy to use which I like. They should do 7 day free trail instead of a 3 day free trail. It’s not enough time to get a feel for it.
5,Eliana Cardon,I just really enjoy this app and the least I could do was to leave a nice review to say thanks. Whenever I’m feeling down this app always makes me feel better/inspired. :’)
5,Holzizzle,"This app has helped change my life. I am much more mindful, and it encourages me to think outside the box. So grateful to have found it."
1,117james,"I started my free trial, and shortly after got charged 2.99. I instantly was about to cancel my subscription but it doesn’t show in my subscription section in my settings. I’ve emailed the company and they told me cancelation are with Apple company, to go into subscriptions and cancel it. I downloaded the app but no where in my recent downloads or subscription where this app found. I just want to cancel it."
5,C@gle,"This app never fails me, with customization settings, options to share with others, and a like or dislike option, and all for free, I love it!!!"
3,elephantevelyn,"Love the app on my phone! However, I recently purchase an Apple Watch and tried to add the motivational quotes to the bottom of the Watch Face, but it doesn’t show the full quote. When I click on the partial quote, it then takes me to a new quote. Please developers, fix this on the Apple Watch."
5,B Robacker,I am grateful for my motivational quotes they seem to come when I need them.  So of them really hit home. Thank you!
5,tg5yjtmtyhn,I would like to heart the ones that pop up as a notification and get the full cases of motivation without Having to pay for it!
5,TmS110,Wish the premium options didn’t cost so much or I would upgrade! I end up having to search google for free but it takes more time :/
5,Vctr1991,"Whenever I look at the app for inspiration, in the moments where I’m feeling unmotivated, it always seems to pick up my moods and ups my motivation to get about the day. Always helpful."
2,afterthecrash,"I paid $12 for a year’s subscription, and I wish I hadn’t. I’m extremely disappointed. I like having the ability to customize the appearance of the quotes, but I just keep getting the same quotes over and over. So frustrating!!! The free version is okay, but I’d much rather just Google quotes and use Word Swag or Reype to customize them. I want a refund!"
5,NAE NAES REVIWES,Just keeps my head up and always has the most incredible things that I can look forward to
5,ChandlerRo,I don’t usually rate apps but this one really gets me. I get notifications daily to get all the inspiration I need to get through my day! It’s very clean and easy to use as well! Thanks for a great product!!
5,Jennigirl123,"I set the timer to notify just before waking up, so I get a good dose of morning inspiration before even making my coffee. It’s been helpful to have a positive message first thing!!"
4,This_User-Name_Is-Taken,"I’ve only had this app for a day but it’s great, love the pick-me-ups during the day. Wish that the membership wasn’t so expensive and that more things were available to non paying people. It’s kinda annoying 😶"
5,Interested about my heritage,I love this app. I always get a notification of motivation right at the time I’m contemplating a thought or action. It helps me in making important decision.
5,Yes6000times,"My motivation widget doesn’t exist. When i try to add a widget it’s not part of the options. I have an iphone 15 pro. Great app btw, it’s helping me go through this depression."
1,wntdm,"Very disappointed in this app. Be cautious as it says you get a 3-day free trial for access to all content but it charges you immediately. $30 is insanely over priced for quotes such as this gem from the Resilience category: “You are resilient”  Appreciate the developer response, but I canceled immediately after starting the free trial, so well before 24 hours prior to the renewal."
5,Booooo instagram,"My quotes on my lock screen is not refreshing, it keeps displaying the same quote, help!"
5,AshleighrebccapurdumAdams,I have needed motivational quotes for a while and it is the best   BUT I don’t like that it barley has anything for free in it I do love all the quotes tho  Creator if you see this please can you maybe give the people that aren’t premium more options for seeing what they want there quotes to be  Other wise I do recommend that you get this app if your going through hard times
4,bggjfyuv,"I’ve gone through a lot of struggles in my life. Losses, rejection etc.. This has reminded me that I am not what my trauma has made me.  I can be something more. Something better. One kind phrase at a time."
2,melissadaniell,"Was great… but recently developed a bug where the widgets ignore fonts and place a white, square border around the image. It’s ugly and makes me not want to use to app. Bug report feature doesn’t work, so here I am leaving a bad review. Fix your app if you want people to pay for it!!"
5,Dari👌,"I just started using this app, and it’s already making me feel better. And helping me let go all of the negativity 👍"
5,Aloha1nae,I really do enjoy this app. It always seems like the right motivation notification comes at the right time for me….
5,KayBeaLovesThis,I love the constant reminders. Many come right when I need them most! I’m extremely thankful!
4,Eden pridemore🤍,I love this! But l don’t like how you have only 3 days until you have to pay for it. I will keep this for a little while but than definitely deleting this later.
4,GalaxyMama,"The quotes resonate with you when you are down. A little daily reminder, everything happens for a reason."
3,artgirl73,New IOS 16 update has this not working properly.  Widget remains at “standard” and cannot change it no matter how many custom widgets I create. The widgets I create then disappear from list. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
4,2babyblues17,"I enjoy the affirmations every day. And I love this app. With that being said every time I see a typo I cringe. And there are so many. I will not share anything that has a typo, proofreading is so important before posting."
5,shan3000,This app is amazing its truly helped me threw a lot of different areas in life and I know it’s because it’s all about kind words or The help or laughter it brings I Adore
5,Mom Eshelman,I am enjoying the free version. I don’t plan on paying for anything. Trying to save money but I need the positivity in life with all the Negitive around
1,someoneiscoolx,They make a rule on Apple which makes no sense. Cancel your free trail 24 hours before it is due the next day in order to not be charged. Lol so if they say 3 day tail like this app. Cancel it on the second day because even if you download it at 12:01am and you play with it and subscribe to the trail at 8:30am. They will not count you canceling it at 6:00 on the third day of your “free” trail.
2,JDMCE5,"Even if I select everything BUT relationships it still hits me like a whining breakup song. “It’s ok to cut toxic people out” “You’re better alone and stronger” blah blah blah. First off, I know. Second, I deselected that but keep getting it showing up. Removed the app, it’s annoying and sounds like someone who can’t move on. I had high hopes."
5,AmandaGOrr,"This app really keeps me in a positive state of mind throughout the day. Even when things seem like the worst, these motivational quotes put me at ease."
5,DeniseWilson2016,"Every One going though something Evan if you think your not, it’s Helpful to have motivation to get you though your day 🤗🤗 Denise"
5,LoouiG,I truly enjoy the motivation I get when the correct quote pops up at the correct time . Makes a huge difference n my day !
4,girlgonebad5099,The fact that they are trying to profit off your mental struggles... You have access to almost nothing helpful or inspiring unless you pay like 20$. A lot of the quotes aren’t that good anyway.
5,Kim733,I love this app! I have it set so I read one message in the morning and one before bed. I like reading it while  drinking my morning coffee and sipping my evening tea. Worth every penny to me.
5,Matika2017,I’m going through so much and this app just gives you the motivation you need to get through it !!

5,fbdien,"I love this app, it makes me realize that I shouldn’t compare myself to other people, and it helped me find the quote I should live up to. I just wanted to say take you to the developers. Smile! :)))"
2,candytree82,"Hello, The widget has stopped working. It is the view I use the most. Since I am paying for the full premium version, I am disappointed that this hasn’t been fixed and has been this way for over 2 weeks now. Can you provide an ETA on when this will be fixed?"

3,HaleyET,I genuinely love this app! My only complaint is that I have it set up to notify me multiple times during weekdays but a lot of the times I don’t get any notifications or any quotes coming my way. It’s almost like I have to open the app once a day in order to get notifications.
5,maddy is number one,"This Apple is going to have confidence and when I’m down, makes me get back up on my feed I keep on moving forward"

4,Bobaloo85,"It’s a pretty good app, I like it, things are too expensive though, I feel like too many things need to be paid for. I also think that it shouldn’t be sending me notifications at 4:35 in the morning, but it’s still a good app."
5,thebookteller,"This app is amazing, you can set it to a certain amount of times you want it to send something! It’s a great positive reminder every day ten times a day. One of my favorite apps of all time!!!"

4,Laylah19,"Enjoy getting the daily quotes! They are great. However, if the price to the subscription were a bit less I would have purchased already. Great app over all though."
4,jageiser,I share these with my family every day. It’s become something we all look forward to. Would like more literary quotes and also more attribution (many quotes are not attributed to anyone) but overall a fun app.
5,hey its hannah,Weather you are going about your life just fine or you are struggling this app gives you so much motivation the whenever you need it
4,վմʍʍվ,I love this so much but it is always asking me to pay for this premium and I don’t I like can’t do anything but read them and I only have 3 choices of background or I have to buy the rest. But it is still great
5,Williams48,"I love the fact that I can have as much reminders of motivation in one day, the motivation is very uplifting and keeps me going. Thank you for creating such an app to support the grind!"

5,Latina2sweet,I love this app you are able to create your own motivation messages with your theme/background.
5,Katyshell,I was little skeptic of buying this app. In these times any little of encouragement you can get is worth to paying🤷‍♀️
5,ASEGA..,It’s like the app reads your mind and it gives inspirational quotes and messages
1,Zach12846,Way to expensive and they will not refund your money at all if you forgot to cancel the trial not even if you canceled it an hour late stay away from this app doesn’t work not worth the price and the customer service is terrible they don’t care about anyone but their money.
5,Gigiandsophiabestie,It makes me believe myself and it makes my happy because I finally have a amazing app that can support me and can tell me nice things all the time
5,Bribreezy629,I’m changing my negative review to a positive one because they listened to feedback and got rid of the ugly black border. The widget looks so much better now!
3,Drug ftsed,Originally I thought this was an amazing app and rated it five stars but now I believe it’s a 2.5 solely because it’s hard too delete and it has will charge you a monthly subscription after a three day period.
5,YuvalManzon,"Thank you for making such a fantastic app. It truly changed my life, for the better."
5,helpless and weird,I have only had this app for a few minutes and I’m already felling so much better.
5,Ervdoggg,This has been the single most greatest Widget right after the time and the date.
5,Jax840512,My widget for the Motivation app never works.  All I get is a blank black widget square on my screen.  How can this issue be fixed???
2,Jfmfmjrj,I used to love this app I’ve been using it for years. Now they require premium for basically every feature. Why do we have to pay for quotes that aren’t even yours? You just compiles them in one place. There are plenty of other apps and websites that do this for free. Very disappointing
5,JD0826,Quotes pop up on my phone multiple times a day just at the right moment.
5,ptvapatrick,"Very helpful a life saver. Going through a really tuff divorce, and this app is helping me so much through out the day, helping me keep a good piece of mind"

5,rebekah0call,This app has helped me I have doubted myself but with this app I have self confidence. I wish it had more free options for younger users so they don’t have to pay for most stuff.
5,Jafuta,I have been having problems with everything and this made it better.
5,Deerose30,"Best app that keeps you grounded and encourages you. When the notification pop ups, it always re-centers me especially when it’s time to focus and leaves me in a good mood!"
5,noprob01,"I really don’t pay too much mind and then all the sudden I get a Godwink ,this app is wonderful! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 💗"
1,Chickadee_Gal,"I have daily reminders set up. Whenever I click the notification, it takes me to the app, and an ad is the first thing I see. Because the ad is the first thing I see, I can’t see the quote that I had originally wanted to see.  It’s extremely annoying and I am considering deleting the app because of it. I downloaded it for motivation, not ads."
5,EliGoAt23,"This is a good app, relieving mentality of any type of fear, pain, or anger. It helps a lot, I will never delete this app, I recommend it a lot for people who need motivation & advice of the day, time, or moment."
4,Dede25y,"Love the app so far, but I'm still in the trial period. However, I've notice that I am receiving the same group of quotes everyday. I was under the impression that I would receive different quotes from my chosen categories."
5,thosearemycookies,"The quotes and sayings are great, the app was designed well for notifications. It truly helps me get through these tough days!"
5,boogie24k,Men before I got this app I was sad depressed trying to stay with the new generation to fit in but now that I have it I feel very great about myself ❤️
4,cloudyyy🌫,"omllll it helps SO much, it’s so encouraging, i had such low self esteem, n i always felt self conscious abt myself, honestly, i’ve only used this for like few days now, but ommmgggggggggg i STAANNNN, i’m ✨obsessed✨ HIGHLY RECOMMEND, i gave it 4 stars cus they keep promoting the “free trial” but it’s a good app anyways, it’s like virtual therapy !🦋"
1,Crappppffgcb,"I’m 18 years old and I’ve been heavily dealing with depression, stress, anxiety all that. I came here for daily positivity to hopefully she’d light on the situation and get me to a right place. However for some dumb reason they want to you pay. Now I know $20 a year is nothing but cmon, you shouldn’t need to pay for something that’s supposed to help you feel some urge of happiness or perseverance. Not worth it."
5,tbtbtb2018,Love this app!!!! This widget gives you quotes that change throughout the day. My only complaint is that I’m a bit anti-love/romance at the moment and I can’t seem to stop those from coming up.
5,BELLT rose,When im in a bad mood and think about self harm i just go to this app and scroll through it. It eventually makes me feel like im not the only one who is fighting depression.
5,swifty_1o,I love this it makes my day all the time I always get notifications and I read throughout them and it puts me in a better mindset and a better mood

4,06channing26,This app is so cool! It is fun to be able to change the theme and even the APP ICON!! It definitely motivates me and is amazing. The only thing I wish you could be able to do is unlock more things and quotes without paying.
5,ththeguy,This app has lifted my spirits and always popped up new things exactly when I needed them sometimes it was almost scary how accurate it was on what I needed to hear I love this app
1,"8:!.9@1!9,&!-&@2!,@;9 an","During the trial period, I was getting notifications regularly with quotes, but once they charged me for the year, I never received a quote again. I checked all my settings, even restarted my phone. Thought this was a good app until I realized I wasted my money. Better off looking up quotes on Pinterest or something."
5,חהב,I have been through hell and back from the past year and this is really starting to help me get my confidence back. Highly recommend this app
5,Debrooks69,Best daily motivation app I’ve come across so far. I read my motivation daily & they really do inspire me to be the best I can be each day. Thanks for providing a good variety of quotes. Best part is most of them are Free.

4,V.Raska,I love ALMOST everything about this app! The only complaint I have is that I wish we were able to put the different fonts on the different backgrounds! Seriously would make it perfect👌🏼
5,Meka9522,I normally don’t even write reviews but this app is super encouraging. The quotes are clearly careful chosen and they show up on your feed during different times of the day. Definitely helpful.
5,dollface.brat,This is app is very beautiful inside and out. I love this app it’s helps me get through some tough situations. But reading the quotes that this app has to offer reminds me that everything is going to be alright.
5,GhostTheSaint,The notifications take you to a different quote than the one intended. This problem wasn't present before.
5,Wiccafox,I was gathering quotes to help me in my pursuit to help others through depression and in reading these quotes it helped me through my own! This is an amazing app with amazing quotes! This app... just helped me so much. Thank you developer! It’s amazing!

5,Hehfjdjejekejdfj,I was haveing a hard time and then I found this app and I feel like I can be myself Ty to whoever made this app
5,Jeffrey cafirio,Good to to read inspirational and motivating comment from other human beings makes me feel like maybe there are good people out there
1,mase.music,The ads and the pop ups are insane in this app. Especially the prompt to download “Loving Kindness” EVERY time I scroll to a new affirmation. The quotes and affirmations are helping me through a breakup but the popups and ads are almost enough to make me delete the app altogether. Not everyone wants to pay $30 a year for quotes…
4,WOW12345656,The only reason that I didn’t give it a 5 star is cuz you don’t have access to every quote. You have to pay a fee. But other than that this app is really inspiring!
5,Nathensurfs1,I am so grateful I came across this app. The regular notifications of great quotes that pertain to what I have specified help me on the daily! I don’t think I’ll ever delete this app!
3,ParkerTaproom,Whose quotes are these? Why not have the author of the quote with each quote? Credit where credit is due and also would be able to look deeper into a quotes history if wanted to. Let me know if this is fixable! Thanks.
3,AndresV.,"Too many options, some seem to be repeated. No iCloud support so all my devices have different favorites, which is the biggest reason for 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. I don't want to set it up 3x."
5,Hello108542,The app is great! I barely got it and I think it’s amazing. It’s an amazing way to start your day with these inspirational quotes. I am motivated to do the things I love! I appreciate what this app does for me!

3,jdeezee40,I selected “productivity” and it keeps sending me quotes related to love and “continuing to love after [the heart’s] been hurt”. However I give it three stars because if it were to provide relevant quotes then it would likely be a fantastic app.
5,layarennr,Just downloaded this app a week Ago it’s been an amazing encouragement for me dealing with a break up and family stuff
5,P. Luckett,This is so beautiful. To have an app that can send me affirmations and quotes all throughout the day…I can choose the frequency and design of the layout…I can add my own. It’s incredible!!

5,ciao.chess,"i don’t think i’ve ever taken the time to write a review for an app, but i knew i had to with this one in particular. i’ve only had this app for a few hours and it has already made such an impactful difference. i struggle with crippling anxiety and low self esteem. to have joyful, uplifting reminders is incredible and wondrous. i think the coolest feature is getting to write your own quotes! such a lovely app :,^)   - thank you 🌻"
5,abri.J19,"Great app , but I wish the entire quote could be read when a notification comes to my phone ."
1,joshbir,"It’s a trash app if you wanna use it for its purpose of daily reminders for someone like me who wanted it to help overcome depression but have to pay $12 a month to get said reminders of certain things which is a steamy pile of trash if you ask me and wish I never wasted my tome downloading it, if you wanna spend the money go for it but I’d rather not download a “free” app that I have to pay monthly to use"
5,dmdndnddnnd,I love this app more than anything. If I am sad I look at the quotes and build motivation 🌈 this app has already started helping for the few days I’ve had it

1,Chirunner8998899889988,"This app is terrible. The free version seemed great so I (foolishly) paid for a subscription, which was a massive waste of money. I would say whoever is “categorizing” the quotes should be fired, except I’m fairly certain the reason this app blows is because someone tried to program a computer to categorize pithy quotes and failed miserably. The notifications with new quotes have become an annoyance because 75% the quotes are stupid."
5,Wash over,Thank you for this app. This has helped me a lot with personal focus and also with my wife and I team. I will continue to use and share with others.
5,rstojo,"These quotes are exactly what I need on some days and other days it’s exactly what I didn’t know I needed to think about, focus on, or turn words into action."
5,EMOJIFACE;),"I love this app, because you can find an awesome motivational quote, in seconds! The only thing I would change is simply so you can add your own quotes in. I recommend it to anyone whom is obsessed with quotes like me!"
5,Go sub to EliteGK,"This is my first good review I have ever left on an app. This app is insane!🔥 I don’t pay for premium but it’s still good for free, you get daily motivation for free!🔥"

5,Sarabugg123,This app has improved the way I think about things and really changed me
1,PharmD2B•2018,Been a happy customer until today. They charged me TWICE this year (1/1 and 3/15) for the premium subscription. Wouldn’t let me log on to my account unless I paid again! Tried “Already a Member?” but wouldn’t register my account.  Terrible customer service because there’s NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM. “Contact Us” email on their site doesn’t work.
2,douxriens,"However, whenever you want to upload your own photos photos to use as a background with a widget, it automatically becomes blurry. It wasn’t like this before. Please fix this or I won’t be renewing my subscription."

4,Lukas Batema,"The app will crash at some point and make you reinstall it to stop the crashing. Other than that, it’s decent."
4,FL1G,I love using this app but the new notification with the words “open and like for tailored experience” is taking away from it.
5,Earthsumit,"I had this app before and it really is amazing,"
5,Duftmd,Love this app along with I am. They both send notifications throughout the day reminding me to take a deep breath and go get it!

3,shb drk,I have had this application for about a month but today it was playing a sound of squid game which really scared me Please solve this problem because this application is really helpful
2,Faye🥰,I just want to say that these quotes of motivation are really helpful to me because  people always but down or talk bad about me or make fun of me. They think that I can’t fit in within them but I never want to fit within them because they act like I can’t join any team.
3,kifink,But I paid for premium and now that I have two months until it runs out they’re asking me to buy premium again so I can get the premium benefits when I’ve already paid for it.

3,Courtney🥴,I like the idea of the app and all and it does it’s almost exact job except that the quotes sent through notifications I have to open the entire app to see. I wish it’d send me the quotes to be seen once they’re sent through notifications.

3,blueskycr,I have had premium version.  Today I had unstoppable ads.  When looking for inspiration I don’t want to be reminded that I am a product especially when I paid for no ads.
5,1'2' & 3,"isn’t there a way to change the “Letters changed”? If there is PLEASE let me know!!  I realize I’m not the Sharpest knife in the drawer, but, I just can’t find how!!  I totally LOVE this app!! 💕😍"

3,go boomer go,Whatever you are playing needs a way to stop. I went to sounds and the only option is to lower the sound and I did but still hearing that sound
2,Artist33762,I just updated the app and it no longer allows me to make a widget gif my Home Screen and the editing of the typography has gone away. You can only change it to 3 colors and 4-5 fonts. I’m very unhappy with this. They need to return the app to how it was.
1,Mishokata,"This app was motivational a while back when there was no bloatware, ads, and endless pay for ‘features.’ Now I can’t receive a quote on my left bar widgets - instead it just shows that I need to ‘open app to add themes.’ I added multiple themes just in case, but it never shows me a actual quick quote."

3,Tmo55;)2791,This app has good quotes.  I wish that the notifications were bigger so I could actually see the entire quote.  Most of the quotes which are notifications are too long to fit on their notifications
3,@lli44,"I love this app and I really like the notifications because they give me little reminders to be strong throughout the day, but I hate the new look. It’s obtrusive and destroys the aesthetic. I liked the previous setup much better because it was minimalistic and didn’t invade the quotes space."
5,Brownayy1775,This app just seems know what kind of mood I’m in and just says the right thing when I need it the most. Thank you for creating this

4,Ruaqt2,I love the motivation messages and the different fonts. The only thing I would change is consider lowering the subscription prices and having a version that is a one time pay.
1,Ily_Nicole,So I was scrolling through my phone looking for a good wallpaper app. I see this and I think oh good some nice motivational wallpapers! I download and the second I get in its all boring stuff just a plain black screen with the quote on them. I go and look for different ones but you have too pay for all of them. So unless you want too pay I recommend not getting this app BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
1,Abc don't let me sing 3434,"Everything to do with this app is buy a month or a yearly fee to get everything! You can only get one category and that is General. They should add more categories to pick for free, but still have some that you must pay for. Also, a monthly or yearly fee for a quote app, why not on basic fee for everything and you get everything. I would do that, if it was a reasonable price!"
5,peppermint shakes are awesome,I’ve had this app for almost a year and it has been absolutely life changing for me! I love affirmations and positive quotes so this app was perfect for me! Love it!

3,Ivanna Ving,A really great app I downloaded while on a lunch break. I saw just I connected to it and fell in love with it. It’s now one of my most favorite apps that actually helps give me that small push I need sometimes.
1,azqwerty123,"The free version of the app used to be great until the most recent changes. When a quote pops up and the app launches, it puts an ad on your screen that does not go away. If you swipe to move it, you then lose the quote you opened to - essentially making the random motivational quotes throughout the day useless since they cannot be viewed."
5,Kami92jdjskcjd,"I was pretty skeptical at first having seen a lot of these apps but this one is different! The quotes are truly original, hand picked and are super helpful. Bought the premium and loving it"
5,The Actual meme,"I have suffered from depression, and anxiety.. whenever I get anxious, I’ll stop eating.. usually towards the end of the day! I’ve been able to eat a lot more now a days!"
5,Gitarski,The app suddenly stops sending notifications
5,breeeeee🤍💕,"I wish everything didn’t have to be paid for, it’s unnecessary."
5,3ric2938,Over all it’s a good app the only real bummer is that everything is locked and you have to pay to unlock it.
5,SunnyMOGal,Every time I might be down or doing just fine I will get an inspirational quote that is exactly what I needed to hear or read! Excellent!
5,Keiko.,It genuinely helps with my random spurts of unsureness and depression. You can set it to come at any time of the day and as many times a day as you’d like on a daily basis. Getting random spurts of encouragement and literally god sent ❤️
5,soniachopra96,Work can get so stressful but one notification with a positive quote can change your mood instantly! That’s exactly what this app does successfully and I love it!
4,Kiykiy🐢,"I love it except for they don’t always put who said the quote or where it’s from. And their free section is slim, but I love the notifications I get. Even the cheesy ones. They really do brighten up my day and plus I love quotes so i love it."

4,YouKnowYouLoveMe😍😍🤣🤣,This is actually VERY motivating it inspired me to tell my crush I liked him (I’m a girl) even if tho he said he didn’t know how if he liked me back this app is still motivating (if you have any tips if that means he does like me plz reply thx)
4,мєℓιѕѕα.,App was great until updating to iOS 18 & now my custom widget has only been showing the same 2 quotes for weeks! Please fix asap!
5,Dr.Shahriar Asgari,I read your daily affirmation and use them in my life .  Thank you for sending
5,Vegas Girl 23,I can’t love this app enough! It it's as it has a sense of knowing just when I need some uplifting words of encouragement or hope.
5,Neneee9,Great app. I love how they offer different categories based on what you could need motivation from. Keep up the good work.
5,I cate hhinks,This app seems dumb and not worth the space but it has really moved me to be more active and be more fun overall
1,SpiderB8,I don’t want to open your app every day. That’s why I had a widget. Locking your quotes behind me opening the app when I paid for your service is dumb. I’m don’t want a widget that constantly is just telling me to open the app. I wanted a widget that gave me quotes and it never gives me quotes anymore. I pulled my subscription and deleted the app.
5,Overall a pretty positive app,It’s very positive and let’s you see the good in you and your life. And also the VERY positive quotes made my day shine and so can yours!
3,Softballer writes,I give this a three because it had good quotes and I like how you can make your own but it is boring and black and it’s like nothing os going on in the quotes so next time give it more action with the picture.
5,Moniiii💖,I really enjoy the motivation app it comes to my phone every morning & it helps me get through my day ❤️
1,boosandwiches,i had a few hundred quotes marked as Favorites and unexpectedly they all disappeared. can’t get them back. they don’t keep your data so if you spend a lot of time making Collections and curating quotes — fair warning they might suddenly be removed and there’s nothing you can do.
5,syzzyQ,These are really gonna keep me on track with trying to be the best version of myself so thank you!!!!
5,Munchieface123,I needed this app and didn’t even know it existed. When I found it my vibration was instantly risen!
1,jan murry,"I’ve been using this app for about 1-1/2 - 2 years. I’ve written many quotes under the “Add” section and I review it continually. Then in November 2022 Apple did an update on my phone and now all my inspirational quotes (and the work I’ve done to add them to my phone) have vanished! Erased! Gone! How would you, dear reader rate this app? New rating “to be determined”."
5,brock/broccoli,Within the first 5ish minutes of using this amazing app I already feel ready to conquer the day!
5,Gottobealexiab,Always a great heart and spirit lifter!  Love getting simple quotes to help me push forward; especially when I’m having a trying day🥰
3,Letourneau 3,Now all of a sudden it never pops up quotes anymore and everytime I open the app it take a a good minute or two before it loads  and shows me even 1 quote! So disappointed because I loved this app.
5,JayeMe07,….sometimes you read the right thing and you’re reminded
5,Amirahjones824,I love this app cause it encourages you to do what’s best for you and to stop letting other people in the way of what you want to do.
4,ChevyWest1,bring back the thumbs down to filter out what I don’t like…only reason I kept my subscription.
5,CapChick26,"Thank you so much for creating this, I began to cry seeing, just how beautiful and amazing this app truly is. It really is a whole vibe!!"
1,salysaly1,"I had to give you one star. I loved this app because the quotes really helped me. Until a quote came up from Heinrich Himmler, a nazi who was responsible for the extermination of Jews. There is no way that any quote from any nazi will motivate me, and I find it quite disgusting that you would allow quotes from racists and antisemites to be a part of your app. Deleting this app for good!"
5,thereallavish.cam,This App is amazing already i’m starting to realize the truth in what’s going on in my life !! TRY IT you won’t be disappointed ❤️
5,I-poduser123,This app is very motivational. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs a little pick me up throughout the day.
5,☞︎𝕔𝕠𝕠𝕝 𝕜𝕚𝕕☜︎,This app has improved my mental health and physical health! I definitely recommend this. my whole family has this app even

1,hi_d_monique,"No stars actually. I stupidly spent money on this app... Initially enjoying the daily positive messages. The quote I saw today (in the midst of horrific American race injustices), attributed to Christopher Columbus, a horrible human by all accounts, was actually spoken by Andre Gide (and more beautifully too), a Nobel Prize winner. In this day and age, encouraging the pathetic worship of a greedy, self-serving colonialist with a falsely-attributed ""motivational quote"" is pathetic. I want my money back and this app is gone."
5,the smart star🤗😀😁,I am a kid that is doesn’t just say good it’s good I have a meant to it  and if I say it it good very good this app keeps u strong and motivated and I love it if u are a person that needs a push in life get this app

4,simplysara1,I love this app and all of its motivational quotes that come with it! But you have to pay for Premium if you don’t wanna deal with adds and if you want to choose category’s then you have to pay. There’s only 4 free samples.

Thanks!

3,ohmyart,I do like the widget...but I am sick of subscriptions. I’d pay $20 one time (even though that’s overpriced imo but ok) but I am sick to death of everything being a subscription and that we are in some dystopian future where we can no longer own things.

5,Nakiru,I look forward to receiving these motivational statements everyday. Especially now in these difficult times.
3,seanismac,"This app is wonderful! The free tier is very fair. Not too many ads. The only things I don't like are that everytime this app gets an update, the theme goes back to default. Also why is there a heart icon in the widget now? The widget is too small to have a favorites icon. Please make it optional. Thanks!"
5,Kcolbduce,It is a little confusing to set up. It appears as if there is a cost after the app is downloaded. But I love getting the motivation alerts!
2,bella123_:-),"I saw that really none of the quotes I was getting had anything to do with me and did not motivate me very much. So, I went looking and saw the categories that fit me were locked. I would only recommend this app to someone who doesn’t have very many life problems and situations."

3,the weird taco 🤪,It’s a good app with nice wallpapers and great notes of inspiration but I think it just needs more you know like some of the catagories you have to have a membership for and It’s kinda confusing like when I first got the app I was so confused but it’s a good app overall

1,Treyyoo,Seemed great. I don’t understand why it is a subscription though. I completely understand that $20 a year is very doable.. but it’s a MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE app. Seems like they are swindling people. Let me pay $5 or even $10 once to initially download the app. That seems appropriate for the “service” provided. Lol I’ll just google some quotes when I feel complacent and save my $20.
2,dc12517,"The quotes are basically Instagram captions from 3 years ago lol for example “I thought you were healing me. But no, you just broke me even more.” 🤔😂 that’s not motivating at all. Just paid $20 for premium and really wish I could get that money back. Anyways, save your money and just go scroll Instagram."
4,GB.101,"This app reminds me that I should be myself and much more! I just wish it didn't cost to have motivation, I have very bad depression and anxiety and some of the saying that would help me the most I can't afford."

5,OrgansiedMom,I love this app because during my day I get these notifications on my Apple Watch and they remind me to be mindful and give me hope !
3,Sheena Burke,"More options should be offered in the free version, people need inspiration when they’re down, not to want to pay x amount of money to read things to help them not harm themselves or whatever they’re in here in search of."
5,Ogre Stone Monolith!!!!,"I love this concept, it’s perfect for quote crazy people like me. The only thing is I want you to add new quotes more frequently and to make the feminism quote pack free😁😁😅 for obvious reasons as they’re the best. That’s it."
5,zlatangod,It helps me understand what I have been given and what should I do to get more of my own

5,Chelle🙂,"These quotes really motivate me, just a daily reminder that I am somebody & that every day may be a challenge but I’ve overcome a lot of those days as well🙂"
3,skyler!24,I love the quotes but you have to pay for almost everything even how many times a day you want to remind your self you matter. And I can’t get any specific type of quotes I just get “all types of inspiration”
2,Jamie Ary,"Note, I tried the free version for a week. Some of the quotes are okay, but I was never awe inspired by anything. A lot of them just had me annoyed that I got a notification to read some bland or generic phrase. I wish it would have been better but I find a lot better content just using Instagram in passing."
5,Exoti333,I love this app so much I have depressed and mood swings and anxiety and this helped me so much I been on this app for 2 weeks now and omg I see a difference in my attitude and I’m more at peace.

2,Chels_lanae,"I love this app, but I’ve noticed twice recently that my followed topics have completely been reset/erased. It’s very frustrating because I follow topics for a reason, and when they reset, I’m stuck looking at the “free today” category to add them all back."

5,Memee05,I love glancing at my phone and seeing a positive and thought provoking message multiple times every day!
1,mariesey1986,Everything is subscription this and that. I under the work put into this cost money but I am literally nickeled and dimed out. I know I can pay $99 for lifetime but I can’t justify it when I can go online and read quotes for free.   I wish you all the best.
5,appfavegirl,These little reminders keep me thinking positive and inspired!  Try it and you might like it.  I love this app!
1,Pat.2023,"Once you pay money and subscribe, no matter what you do, you will not get notifications anymore. This app is a money grab and pointless no matter what settings you try or however many reminders you add. Do not subscribe and save your money."

1,airs44,I am giving this a low rating due to them not having the city I was born in as an option which means I can’t use this app! Was looking forward to using this since I know others that love it. This is disappointing! Hopefully others don’t have this issue too!!!
3,Bapleasant,This has turned into my favorite app! The random notification that gives me just that little encouragement to get pushing but recently it stopped working. Please hurry and fix this
1,Mandalayyy,"I’m sorry I really wanted to love this app. But the quotes are SO CORNY I can’t stop laughing at them 😂 for example, in the confidence category: “Stop doubting yourself.” Like..??? Ok 😂😂😂😂😂  This app is a good concept, but my god, the developers really said QUANTITY > quality. Deleted after 5 min of scrolling through trite, useless words. The women’s t-shirt aisle at wal-mart has more profoundness in its quotes. 😂"
5,mal420!!,"i’ve been struggling with depression,anxiety and adhd for so long esp into my teen yrs. this is such a great way to see things differently and are very uplifting. it’s also very cool you can customize the app to your own liking which i think is pretty cool. definitely recommend this to someone who is struggling or just needs some positivity in their day!"
5,012Brian,Let’s just hope this is free Lots of orioles could use this where in from
3,90'sBabyIn80'sMercedies,"To whom this may concern, I thought this app was going to be free but when I saw after a certain period there would be a subscription. I automatically deleted it after the 3 minutes I opened it. I went into my settings to delete the subscription but didn’t see it.   Will I still be charged down the road even though I just deleted it?  Please let me know.  Thank you,  Customer"
5,Djmdjdhd,"This truly is a great app. Whenever I get anxious, I just think about some of my favorited quotes and power through the day."
5,italuan65,Just one simple motivation helps me get through everyday!
5,Amy Hink,This app gives me reminders all throughout the day that help me get through my day. I struggle with anxiety and PTSD and this app helps remind me of my worth.
1,AMTviolin,I feel like this is something I could just google for free. The quotes are generic and some are sub-par. Three day trial and then they have you locked in paying for an entire years worth.   If you want quotes get a book from the library and make yourself sticky notes of your favorites. Probably better quotes and it is free!
5,consultantMK,What an amazing app for daily doses of motivation throughout my busy day! Truly changing the way I think and therefore live and work!👏💖👌
5,pezcaso,"Truly brings light to my day after reading some quotes, helps me re align with me goals and pull myself out of a dark hole I know I don’t want to be in."
5,Six Lessons for Success,So much of what we get through our phone is negative...I use motivation to turn my phone into a positivity device!
1,Mrkrum,How many times do I have to thumbs down the stupid Jordan Belford quote before it stops being literally the only one showing up?? I have changed my settings to only things that would absolutely not qualify for this quote yet there it is every time I open my phone. Don’t waste your money on this app unless you’re a huge Jordan Belford fan.
2,Bangtan0613,After the latest update it’s all about ads ads ads. You can’t scroll twice without an add popping up. This used to be my go to for motivation through my depression and was the only app I had as a widget but it’s to annoying now with all the ads. Most likely deleting it.
5,ITNCNCJEODNCJFJFJFBCHSJEPWNFJ,"Hi this is very good,it helps me if I have any hard times,or if you just don’t think you matter or if your down thinking you don’t belong. So I rate this a 5 stars! Bye,"
5,Wicked is already taken,It’s nice to wake up and look at my phone and see something positive. Keep it coming!!
1,BigAssSackofTree,This app made me really insecure and got facts wrong that made me upset and angry. They said that depression anxiety and stress are caused when you live trying to please others. That made me upset because that’s not true. They say that you have a lot of love in my heart and to give some to myself. So they’re implying that you don’t love yourself. That’s wrong.
5,TASHARADIO,"When I’m feeling down or need a little reassuring, this app is just what I need for a quick pick me up."
5,Zaidshammout,"Getting this push that u need during the day is something everyone needs,"
4,4M4rill0,I f you fix the bugs in the application while it runs an ad the application would be functional.  It is a shame that that happens because it seems like a good app.
5,DaGreekFreak,I just downloaded this app and I’ve already seen improvements. It’s helped me through so much and made me see the light in total darkness.
5,Kaleb_JKS,"Sometimes these are just what I need to push through the bad days, and on the good days, it boosts my confidence even more so..."
5,Lanxum555,"This app has helped me get through tough days and difficult situations, it’s also helped me share positivity to everyone using these quotes."
5,unsubz,It is a great app but trying to unsubscribe before my trial is over and i am charged a fee. How do i do this as there is no option through the app
5,TheJDAWG96,This caption says it all. I use so much time when looking for quotes and now I have an instant generator and every single one so far is GOLD AND RELATABLE
5,Iwasborninthe90sbro,"Every morning and throughout the day, waking up to these awesome quotes just honestly gives me faith, it’s like the quotes read my mind and know what I’m going through"
5,ractchet duck,I love this app so much. I have anxiety and depression so every time I get a notification about a new quote of the day I feel so much better about what’s going on. Amazing I’m speechless. 🙂
5,AJ Davenport,Motivation has helped me realize all the good I highly request it it is amazing so if you are looking for some positive things then motivation is for you
5,hermossa.nene,It help with a lot of things I go through in my life and it help you push the Pressure out you and it fell like you have something to Motivate you everyday
5,emmie-<3,The apps sends a ton of quotes throughout the day and they seem to pop up whenever I need them the most. This app is seriously one of the best apps on my phone. I love it ❤️
5,Larniebell,It is very nice and it has amazing scripts and it really changes you and helps you get through things that are hard for you.❤️
5,Nelly E,I absolutely love this app! I have set the quotes to come at my “tough” times of the day and they are always perfect for me in that moment!
3,Stevenv24,"I love the quotes and even added as a widgets the only thing I HATE is your can go back. So there was a really good one I wanted to share but when I click on it, it open the app and Disappeared. If you can fix that as an update I will change it to 5 stars"
5,Camthedudebro,I really didn’t expect the impact of these small daily messages! Highly recommend!
4,Joel S Hurt,"Simple daily reminders of what really matters, keeps you humble, and pushes you forward! Only 4 stars because of course you need to pay to have access to the entirety! But good either way!"
1,darbymay,"The price is ridiculous, and when you pay for 1 month, it auto renews each month - and there is NO OPTION anywhere that I can find to END it. So I’m continually charged $4.99 a month for this. I’ve been through the App Store, my phone’s app settings, etc, and can’t find an option to cancel this subscription."
4,MissGMB,I love all of the quotes and all the inspirations. But the only thing you can do is read the quotes. I feel like the free version is too limited.
5,Kkrawchuk,I love this app. I have been going through a rough time…. This app give me the pick up I need to get through my day!
1,nicknamechoicehasmeannoyed,"The app functionality is limited for free users. Which is fine, you gotta make your money. But for a self help app to be so pushy with the paid version seems counter productive. What about people who don’t get it because they can’t afford it? Money troubles are usually one of the biggest stresses in one’s life."
3,GOATDYLFISHCRIS,"Out of date items referring to years such as 2021 should be updated, and the ads are overly excessive and long."
5,mytiktokreview78,I love this app because when I’m down it picks me up !!! I really like the part where I can adjust it due to me own mood!!!
5,Chxhdyd,This app is making me feel like a brand new person again I love it so much
4,ellethepumpkinsmasher,"The widgets now have a black border, and show the square with the quote but smaller, it looks very very unpleasant so I’m hoping there is a fix :). Thanks ~"
3,rhonmurr72,The app crashes before it even opens since the updates. I never had issues until 2-3 days ago.
4,LaDonnaa.,"I think it’s a really nice app specially, when you are having hard times and Mainly when you don’t have anybody to talk too ..💔"
1,preferprivacy,"I’ve repeatedly written to them about this. One cannot listen to music and scroll through quotes. They say they’re fixing it but it’s taken months. As a premium subscriber, I’m fed up and I guess I won’t bother renewing next time unless this is fixed asap. Would be a great app if it didn’t do this."
5,jy. ramsey,I love waking up to a different quote each day as well as reading motivational quotes when I’m having a bad day.
5,sexcsugar,This app really does help me changed my perspective on life and my mindset. It seems to always send me the right quote at the right moments
2,Aubinbel,"I want to love this app but it simply doesn’t function the way I want it to, and for $20 that’s pretty annoying. The daily alerts I set for myself do not go off as scheduled, and that’s literally the only reason I got this app. I want my money back."
3,CiCi 1976,Used to be free and then 1/2 were free and now only a very select few are free. I’ve had this app for years but I’m not going to pay $20 a year for a daily motivation.
5,bars4theteam,Ive had a rough two months and the first one bit me like a bullet flying more then mph sparked a whole memorie that rolled down my cheek 5 stars indeed   -gentle giant
5,David10222,I already feel better 2 hours into my day. Keeping my grounded and focused

5,Jaeston Smoke,I have had so much stress and it’s app helps so much. Sometimes after school I just get on this app and my day is so much better!!!!!❤️
1,S_J_001,App isn’t worked much after the latest version updates. Quotes take forever to load. Widget is busted and only shows a black screen — it doesn’t populate anymore. Notifications no longer work via push notification.  Please fix!
5,7deej,Having issues with my life and these little quotes keeps me motivated to never give up.
4,blessednfavored0315,I didn’t think this would be beneficial for me however I was wrong! A friend referred this app plus I kept seeing it on Facebook! The quotes definitely hit home😌
5,Shaniya M,This app helps me to motivate myself as well as my workers. Keep it coming very good for me an my kids staying focus

4,Blonde sunshine,It’s a nice app and I like the variety of quotes and backgrounds but I do wish their were more free features and could customize your own background and fonts. Mostly a widget screen filler but she cute.
5,redskye17,I think I found a great app. So far every quote is speaking my life!!  I have depression and this app will be a great tool for my emotional well being.
5,Srink2,I have only had this app for two months but I have enjoyed it everyday.
5,elizabeth liza vid,Not to as it helps me with my anxiety and depression but some of these things are a little funny when you put them in a different perspective
5,AspiringFrame,I’m excited to learn more about this app. What better way to do self care then invest in something that’s gonna make your life more positive.

3,vcdjvghbvgggffgj,Why does every single app out there have prices it’s kind of dumb I do enjoy this but I think if you unlock a theme by watching a video it should stay unlocked I just don’t want to pay for this app and I haven’t seen any widgets yet so I’m kind of on the edge..
5,Cflo0827,I love having these notifications. They help me stay on track and stay positive when I need them the most!

5,JR Bones,"Always something different and, well, motivating! The app functions and alerts well and I like the simplicity of it."
2,bmatre,This app does not allow to see favorites unless you buy paid version. That itself is worst policy. I can understand ads come if we do not use paid version. So do not spend time in marking your favorites.
5,#PREPPYSQUAD,I love this app as much I so “I AM”   It tells me I’m enough the past is the past  Love doesn’t create excuses and how I will get through things ❤️
5,Aaliyahroseborjas,I don’t have a title but all I know this is really helping so far. I just started so thank you. Is my title
2,Jodyjanda,For a week straight I have only received Billie Ellish quotes. I went into the app and added that to my preferences to mute it so it would stop. But it has not. It used to be great but I don’t want quotes from Billie Ellish. I wish there was a thumbs down option!
5,alexa jj,I am trying it for free and works very well. Inspiring quotes adjusted for what you want/need. You should definitely download
5,Kaitlyn RK,This app gave me so much motivation to do so many things and it helped make me feel more confident.
5,roberta bella,I think it’s pretty motivating sometimes to get random quotes that kind of left you  I think it’s a good app
2,bookrockbetty,"When I first downloaded this app I absolutely loved it and did not mind the short ads that popped up every once in a while, but now they are very long/frequent and I find myself utilizing a different app to avoid."
5,kay311@,I would recommend this application to anyone who really needs to have some enlightenment.
4,DevanLoux,I love this app this app has literally saved me from my bad days. The only thing is that I think it’s just a bit to pricey to have the app.
4,JakeLuck43,I’m on iPhone 7 and the login page looks funny with no vertical padding. Should be an easy fix
1,NightiOwl,"I liked this app at first, it was a nice widget to have on my Home Screen. Started seeing the same quotes or phrases repeated quite often but wasn’t that bothered by it.   What IS ANNOYING though is that there used to be free themes to use for your quotes and paid themes. Now they’re all asking me to “try” them for free for a limited time.    No thanks. I’m done."
5,amazing beautiful rey,I just downloaded the app and I already love it!! All of the inspirational quotes are so amazing! If you’re going though rough times I suggest to download this app<33
5,Eight4Ever,I’m exceptionally motivated by these words of action. I look forward to showing you.

1,j000712,People are looking for inspiration and pick me ups and your charging them. To have to pre cancel just to keep it free seems cliche. To draw in a higher crowd it would be more effective to be free and charge after your into the app.. but you guys are rediculous to charge and pay for something someone else can do with a little help from family and friends
5,Aidi baby,Sometimes I feel down and when these motivational quotes pop up on my phone and reassure me that things will be alright.
5,Hottub Nana,"I love to fill my mind with positive thoughts everyday to reprogram my mind from the negative, frightened person I was conditioned to be.  New thoughts can change our beliefs."

3,katein98,"The subscription price for the app is completely outrageous. Plus, the free options are insane. For example, you can’t even save favorites.. However, I do love the look of the app and how you can personalize the quotes by changing the styles."
5,aiilove13,"This is my first app review ever, and I wanted to share how much I really enjoy Motivation!  Lots of custom options even on free version."
4,ara1039,The quotes are really lovely ❤️ but I just think is stupid how I have to go premium to get more backgrounds... that’s the only bad thing this app has and it would be more admirable if they didn’t charge for just BACKGROUNDS.
5,Carolina P. Girl,I love quotes. And this app will send me a motivational quote throughout my day and it kind of reminds me to stop and don’t stress out and they inspire me. Highly recommended!!
5,Thankful Tara,I really love this app! I always seem to receive quotes that are what i need in the moment.
1,ilovemypartner,"EVERYTHING in this app is something you have to pay for, even the LGBTQ+ quotes. Like someone has to pay to be supported for their sexuality? this app is simply made to make money, don’t buy it if you aren’t willing to be spending every pay check on it."
3,Enzo____,"I honestly love this app , but It is a bit pricey against my other subscriptions , however The fact my app has been glitching has me reconsidering that $20 a month"

5,hvgyvghb,Sometimes you really need that motivation
5,rileigh higgins,I just love this app so so much it makes my days so much easier and gives me hope just love it
5,Mr Bounceback,The quotes that appear fall in line perfectly with my situation at that moment it appears!
2,Steven 😪,"The quotes seem super sweet not very motivational, I don’t really want to open my phone to see “every piece of you is a burst of beautiful” I personally don’t seek any affirmations, this isn’t motivational it’s just sweet. I’d rather it tell me I’m not doing enough or that I need to work harder."
5,It's Good Karma,I love this app I always look forward to the motivation and inspiration it provides!
2,Minnie sota,Added free version to my watch. Every other day the quote was “I love you” or something along those lines. Just weird.I don’t find that motivating at all. Quotes in the app look interesting but this is not what is showing up for me.
5,Charities02,Helped me really overcome my issues with other people I know
5,izzy_is_cool__,I love this app because I live very far away from the person I live most so this inspires me to keep going.
1,nessajane_95,"I have had the app for quite a long time now and just realized that all the features that used to be free are now locked behind some membership. At this point, in order to use the app you basically have to pay. What?"
5,Syd&Nate,Spot on every single time with the quotes. Loving this app have my whole family using it
4,🉐💘🎀,It’s a good app overall but I feel like it shouldn’t cost money for these quotes because some people might need them and they are locked
1,hdjeirieiisjrnekskd,"I’ve had this app for a while and it’s been very useful, but it’s very frustrating to have watched that overtime more and more features have been switched over to the “premium” version, making the free version less and less unique and interesting."
5,EdenBeeden,"This app makes me feel a lot better about myself, 10/10 for sure!"
5,trezzamaemoore02,The app sends you daily quotes sporadically and they always give me a push or a little bit of motivation
5,imyourunicorn,I gave this 1 star because I had to give something. This worked for only ONE DAY. Worst $20 ever spent .
5,alexis Newman 12345,I love this app! The quotes are awesome and inspiring!You can set it to pop up at different times and give you that little extra umph inspiration throughout the day.
5,Dempsey1121,"Favorite app, just wish it didn’t cost so much to unlock categories and upgrade."
5,vintageky,This motivation app is a good ole friend to to check in with throughout the day to keep you in check!  Glad to have it!
4,yczhao7,"love every piece of it. It would be pwrfect if I csn have Chinese display instead of Englsh. I undrstand Eng but when it comes to motivation words, I found that only mother language hit you most."
5,BbaabbyygirlllW,"So helpful if your going through something , or you just want a little reminder to start off the day just like me :))"
1,Jimbo72,"The newest update has made this app worse. When I get a random quote notification and click on it, or click on the quote showing in the widget, it takes me to an ad to upgrade the app that can’t be removed. And you can’t see the quote you came to see. If this doesn’t get changed the app will no long be useful for me."
5,mayaslushie,"I really love this app, it seems to pick the right quotes at the right times and just makes me feel better."
5,KathrynElisabeth,"This app is amazing! I love all of the quotes, they are all so encouraging. The name of the app really fits it. I feel so motivated after reading my daily quotes. I highly recommend this app!"
5,allthenamesaretakn,"I am manic depressive, panic attacks, depression, PTSD, bipolar  And this literally helps me when I need it!  Thank You 2 the creators"
5,Siana_Translate,I wish it would let me unlock all topics for free but there are so many good topics for free and they are so effective!! They make me feel so good everyday so inspirational!!

1,blaqmare,You have to open the app each day to receive notifications despite choosing daily notifications in settings. I’m a busy mom and don’t want to be beholden to an app that doesn’t stick with settings choice of “daily”. I quit paying for monthly subscriptions since their notifications quit daily.

1,ICUNURSE33,"I enjoy the motivational messages, but do not enjoy how many are sent per day.

But now I can’t tap on the send, or the heart ...bc the favs, theme or motivation links are higher/larger and  hide them.

I go ahead & renew & guess what have had like 2 affirmations all day!  What the heck is that about!! It works for free to reel people in????

1,Hunybny,I deleted the app after the free trial and went to make sure it was cancelled and it never gave me the option to cancel it and it charged me anyway. I don’t even want the app. Be careful downloading unless you want to pay $20. If it wasn’t as expensive I may have kept it. But looks like I’m stuck with it anyway.

5,Mr_Harper,Absolutely love this app! Simple and beautiful design. You can get really creative with the material while staying insanely inspired! Thank you guys!
3,mari0321,Love the app but wish the free style came with more pretty themes. The subscription price is a bit outrageous. Love the  variety of quotes I get. Besides the price and lack of things you can do unless you pay is the only reason they don’t get a 5.

1,mjksludge,"I thought this would be motivational. It’s mostly trite advice. And the advice from celebrities is unwelcome and useless. Why do I care what Will Smith thinks? I don’t even like Will Smith. I was willing to put up with that, but you lost me when a quote popped up from Wayne Dyer. No. I’m not doing that. I even have a year left on my subscription, but I’m deleting now."
5,Milford donaldson,"How do you get widgets? I’ve been using this app for a while and I love it, the widget feature looks awesome but I am not sure how to activate. Someone please help."
4,smokeymfbandit,Love the app honestly. The quotes always seem to relate what I’m going though and helps a lot. If I can change or add one thing it would be to make the quotes be a wallpaper that changes.
3,trash55567,I continue to reset it because it does not send notifications. I have the app set to 10 notifs a day and I get three for the first day and then no more after until I reset it again
3,MsTavie,Was really enjoying this app and for the past six months I’ve been able to get quotes. But today I could no longer enjoy as I have to sign up for trial 😩 very disappointed. So I had to delete it.
3,IridescentMonster,I don’t like the fact that I have to pay a monthly premium subscription in order to get the whole experience. It takes up most of what the app offers.
5,Michael J98R,Sometimes it makes me happy all the time when I read some motivational quotes :)

2,Nicolelyn33,"I can see where it would work for some. But as someone who deals with severe depression and anxiety and persistent suicidal thoughts, telling me it’s a good day to be alive or to think about what a precious privilege it is to be alive, isn’t help. Something like this should absolutely have focus for people like me. People like me need motivation."

5,Jo ghejejndm,It makes me a better person
5,dannyclutchz,I love this app so much. When I am feeling down this app always cheers me up
1,AmandaSpeirBubis<3,"“Motivation” app was a waste of time and download space with sub-par graphics and a rude, poorly-written “motivational” quote as the first Widget display tile. I immediately deleted this application and wrote this one out of five star review to warn others not to download this free app. Thank God I did not pay for it! -Amanda"

1,Noah2287,Loved this app before the new update now the theme color for my widgets doesn’t go to the edge of the widget anymore.   There is a white border during light mode and a black border during dark mode and the theme color is a square with the quote within.  Very disappointing. Will change to 5 stars once this is addressed.

2,ZoyaElizabeth,It’s hard to use when you can’t get the pop-up ad to close. Every time I hit the x it took me to some scam site. It was a waste of time trying to fight an ad. Definitely deleted this app.

1,AyyGee17,So far so good... the honestly in my opinion it’s way to pricey... drop the monthly subscription options.... Add a one time fee... fee needs to be dropped to at least $10 overall. If anything changes with the pricing and it’s a fair cost I’ll will subscribe and change my review. Thanks

5,JessicaMillette,This app gets my through the day! I love seeing what quote will pop up in my notifications! I have the free version!
1,Sksosuabwctajsldndbhs,To pay this much is absurd! I would really enjoy this app but I don’t have $4.99/month OR $35/year for this. Cheaper price and I would consider it. And do a 24 hour free trail so you can decide if it’s something you want to purchase. I use motivational wallpapers for Facebook and wallpapers so I was bummed I couldn’t at least try it out.
5,Car_ Fem,I love the quotes in this app! Almost everyone one i read helps me in one way or another. Definitely Worth uploading

1,KellsBells920,"Many of the quotes are very poor quality or just nonsense. I’ve noticed a lot of grammatical errors as well. “I hate being lonely” isn’t inspirational or motivational. I’ve adjusted my topics/settings yet still get garbage “quotes” that are pretty senseless. I paid for this?! Very poor app, do not recommend."
2,NicknamesAreVeryBoring0,The app use to be top notch. The widget would change and it was great. Now the widget is blank and it’s even blank when I open the app. Why am I paying for an app that doesn’t work properly?
5,mannyG626,"Love this app , helps me get through my days . Nice and friendly reminders"

2,Kristin2654,It’s frustrating to pay for an app and have notifications set up but you don’t actually receive them all the time like you are supposed to. It’s hit or miss every day if I am going to receive them.
5,Tiny.shiny,It’s a really good app. When i’m down this app brings me back up and motivates me to the fullest.
3,bahahfbnfkdnd,Why did you change the widget color it was really clean when it was black I loved seeing it now it’s more of a eye sore on the screen. But besides that it is still good just wish the widget was black again

5,Ziza the Diva,This app has helped encourage me just when I needed it. Would definitely recommend!!
1,TorqueyTheGreat,"It is a really nice app. While most of the content is known, it’s nice to have them appear randomly during the day as they brighten up some dull moments for sure. However they made the ads so annoying that you either have to get the paid version or delete the app. I deleted the app."

5,Peaceful Endeavor,The quotes are thoughtful and motivating.  Often exactly what I need to hear is what pops up.  One of my favorite apps.
3,Noodel ninja,I was fine with not having much diversity in my quotes but now it limits you to one quote per day which is kinda annoying since (correct me if I’m mistaken) you got about 3 a day before. Other then that I like it.

2,MandiKing,"Haven’t been able to open this app for 3 days, despite paying for an annual subscription. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it won’t allow me to login.   You cannot speak with anyone in customer service—you can only submit feedback in an email.    Sometimes the quotes are grammatically incorrect, have spelling errors, or the author is incorrect.   It’s a great concept, but no longer worth the money."

5,slay1379,I just don’t like how we have to pay..💔
5,Yuille15,I love the quotes and I love how they vary. Some quotes do reappear very often though. More quotes should be implemented. But that’s it everythjng else is great.

5,unknown_75,I really look forward into using this app. Everything is just so positive and it uplifts you.

1,pastelkittyfairy,"Unless you pay extra, you don’t get to change your theme and you only get a few reminders :/ not much fun. Your background in the app will just be just black and white, and you don’t get to choose the motivations you get. Only general ones."
5,veronavixen,this app has lit me up since i downloaded it. i am so happy to see nourishing words pop up in my notifications on the regular - the notification settings are so beautiful customizable! i also adore that when i am away from my phone that i can still read it on my watch!

5,Chesqi,I think this app is so aesthetically pleasing and also so beneficial and helpful.
1,Zodiak67,Absolutely nothing is accessible without purchasing the premium package first. You are not able to search categories without upgrading to premium. You cannot use the search feature even without upgrading to premium. Not an app that is worth it.
4,@Echoshine,I think that it is quite good but there could be more quotes with the person who said it
5,Suavay Gawd,Keeps me going 10/10 I recommend!!
2,Bigboots2007,"It’s obvious what you’re doing, stop releasing daily updates with the same change log to get people to notice the app. It’s annoying, if it continues I’m deleting."

3,karslee325,Motivation used to stand out to me for the quality of its quotes. It feels like the quality has gone down though
1,Arose0912,"This app seemed like a great way to get motivation and so of course, I downloaded it. However, to get motivation for almost anything, you have to pay for them. No watching a video or two to unlock just one. What a rip-off."
5,bobbirn2013,Seems like it’s exactly what I need to hear every day. Thank you.

2,MzChargirl16,"I dont like the new update. I have to watch an ad EVERY time I want to see how a quote looks on a different theme.  Very irritating. The themes did get better. However, I refuse to pay for quotes that are EVERYWHERE else on the internet."

3,RebelliousReviewer,"It’s a great app with actual motivational quotes, but I am not paying money unlock all the categories. Most of it is locked unless you pay premium, so if you want to get the best out of this app, you gotta pull out your wallet..."
2,hockeystarokkkkk,I downloaded this app because I needed some quotes to keep me happy turns out if you don’t pay for the premium you can only get the general quotes which made me mad because I don’t want to pay for the premium. That’s why I’m giving it 2 stars

2,thebug0212,"I don’t know what I anticipated downloading this app.   The first few days were nice. Little quotes here and there, reminders to keep going. Very enjoyable.   Then I get this: Your eating disorder thoughts will be strong. But you are stronger.   The last quote I saw before deleting the app was: 90% of your plans are going to fail no matter what you do. Get used to it. -Mark Manson  Unsure what kind of ‘motivation’ they’re after but that’s not it."

1,CCJJ16,This app has missing screws. I’m not sure how many times I’ve tried and set the topics right. Everytime it sends me “motivation” about love life and things I never chose. Telling me I need to find myself a true love??? Is this motivation or a joke?. It started really getting me upset at the things it says. Deleting!

3,FDusty410,Great quotes.   Widget still needs improvements! I can’t tell you how annoying it is to see a quote you like to go to the app and not be able save/favorite it. If there was the ability to do so from the widget that would help.  Custom backgrounds could use a easier interface when applying them to widgets.  Those two things make me regret purchasing this subscription.

1,ashlikespenguins,I gave this app one star because I have to pay for literally everything. I can’t even look at all of my favorite quotes without having to pay. I think this app would be better if I didn’t have to pay for so much stuff when I can simply look up quotes for free.

5,LaLeshia,I am a 66 year old retired professional and I found the quotes to be very refreshing.
3,happystrawberries,"It’s very strange. Whenever I put my phone on Airplane Mode, the quotes I get under Encouraging Words category are actually discouraging/negative words. I think Motivation app got hacked."

2,-Matt C,"I really like this app, the design is great and I love the quotes, but $20/year is way too expensive. If it was a one-time cost and like $9.99 I would buy it, but there’s no way it’s worth a $20 annual cost."
5,DeeBme81,You pay for what you are asking with this APP!

5,allisonhowe,"I live this app, with a lot of themes and topics for the quotes. Would recommend, I could read the quotes all day."
2,Lelmem,A lot of the quotes are saying they were by people who said them but did not create them. I don’t think Joel Osteen came up with one door closes.... proverb. I enjoyed the widget on my screen and it changing. But I’m not paying for inaccuracy.
5,naoalns,This gives me so much energy during the day and keeps me motivated and going I looove this app!
5,Dixiekaye,I just started reading yesterday and every single one makes me think deeply. Great app.
1,_2oph1e_,"I like when I could just put the widget somewhere in the bottom. But now, in iOS 14, I can only put it near the top in the Today View. I’m not telling you to revert the update. I’m just suggesting of adding the old widget back before the iOS 14 update for iOS 14 users."

4,Dollyyall,Why does the widget does not work?  When you add a motivation widget it shows a black widget with nothing written in it.
1,Hwnsikemd,“Storms don’t last forever” is super tasteless to send on this day when a good portion of my state and the adjacent one are in a state of emergency with people across the southeast US literally trying to survive the effects of flooding from the impact of Helene. Do better. Check your algorithm.

5,lunasoleil2020,I love this app that Ive been trying to get the widget I don’t seem to know how. I was wondering if someone could help.
1,NicoleValdes,They sign you up without even giving you an option to opt out and then don’t provide an easily acceptable cancellation button if you don’t want to read their posts.   The ones they have forced on me so far aren’t even motivating.

1,DaleSterling,"When this program originally renewed, I CALLED within the specified time limit to CANCEL my service   I assumed your employee canceled it therefore I REFUSED to use your reminders   I don’t recall if a REFUND was issued  I assumed it would go back on my charge card    PLEASE check your record for my logged call    PLEASE issue me a FULL refund because I did call within a day to request this service be canceled    My opinion is THIS company is GREEDY!!! And has dishonest practices   I warn people to not use it"

5,cgranb,Some of the best advice I’ve received is from this app
1,Dirt23manhole1,Ask yourself why you’re paying for motivation in the first place. Motivating people is supposed to be a humane thing. Charging people for things you get for free offline is not just ridiculous that’s straight up dishonest.
1,belliboni chris,Something as simple as reading quotes that can be found on google for free requires a subscription? “Are business taking our money or are we blindly giving it to them?” That should be a quote on your “app”.

1,Holey Mole,All day long my “daily motivation” keeps showing me “Onboarding_quote_noname” even though I keep trying to get rid of it. I’m also paying the annual subscription fee so what am I paying for exactly?

1,galvanized2320,I’m disgusted with how many 5 star reviews this app has!! You get 3 days as a “free trial” and then this app will charge $30 for their service. Seems like a good way to take advantage of people searching for affirmations.

3,D4d0ch,"The widget is not working efficiently. It does not refresh quotes, is unable to show quotes after updating.. the app itself is stellar but poor performance"
1,marketing basics,Please quit sending me alerts at the exact same time from the same platform as I am. One I appreciate two at once makes me ignore both and make everything you try to instill total spam. Get it together marketing.

3,123@@wei,"This app has good navigation, but there is always no results when I try to search quotes via people’s names. A lot of quotes have no author!"
1,bev the mad girl,You have to pay and most things you would like to do is like premium and you have to pay without paying there are dumb quotes and the color of the back ground
5,Spazz 35,Keeping me going and I’m appreciative of that🤞🏾❤️
5,mattymattny,"On the morning of December 19th, 2022. My life changed forever. When I woke up for work that morning it was just a regular morning. That is until my body decided it was going to stop working and fight to stay alive. If not for the fast actions by my own family to come to my room and assist me immediately and call emergency medical services right away. I probably would not be here today to write this review. I’ve always been a positive guy no matter how bad the day was or what’s happening. I just always managed to stay focused and calm and be grateful to be alive. That morning I was clinically dead for 3 minutes. I was escorted by police in an ambulance to a nearby hospital and then flown by medevac helicopter to a nearby trauma center where I was ultimately stabilized after I was in a coma for a few weeks. The only lasting affects I have to deal with now are regaining my mobility back in my left side of my body. Particularly my left leg and left arm and hand. I’m extremely grateful to be alive. My goal is to continue to inspire others to never give up. I have that quote tattooed on my upper left arm that states “Don’t Give Up, Don’t Ever Give Up!” Great quote from the late great legendary Jimmy Valvano. He always remained positive and inspiring despite all his medical issues that ultimately took his life. I’ll never forget him. You’re daily quotes have helped me to remain positive and optimistic during my 9 months of recovery so far. That is the key to success. Positivity! Positivity Is Key to Success. Thank You for helping me during this difficult period of my life."

5,daisykalcaraz,Amazing how a simple quote could change your mood!
1,Achilles5684,The app was very good until it really stopped displaying quotes on the widget. It just has a black screen that’s doing nothing. It also stopped being interactive.  This is not what I paid for...

1,Leah Raider,"So this app is pretty okay. But if you don’t pay you only get to see general and love. The rest of them are locked. Also with the font and colors, i think you only get 3. It would be amazing if we could have more of both. Thanks!"

5,melissa pacheco Aguilar,I love your app it’s so nice I love it
1,Fernanda2016,I don’t understand having negative words in a motivation app - and then you can’t delete the quotes you dislike… developers should focus on these 2 details
5,lid wood,The quotes really feel tailored to your situation.
1,she if diene,I’ve had this app for 2 weeks and received a total of 2…I’m supposed to be getting them 6x a day. But they made sure to charge me for the whole year  day 1.
5,DikArny,Very good app that gets me through the days.
1,epicstep,They don’t even pop up on my screen. I forgot I even paid for this mess. I don’t get automatic quotes. I literally have to open the app. What’s the point.

5,avavmavav,"This app really helps, highly recommend!"
1,cetugx,"The quotes are extremely weak and lack originality. They are suitable for teenagers and people with lower levels of education. They are not noteworthy or thought-provoking, but rather simple and easy to forget. Most have an underlying tone of “woe is me”."
2,Bellasaint,"Maybe I get a lemon. Cause I read good things about these earpiece. But the one I have , cannot charge or stay in my ear for literally 5 mins    Just went dead."

5,Madimadichic,Only have this app one day I’m already in love so inspiring and positive exactly what I needed
1,yRallTHEusersTAKEN,It’s free to download but then you have to have a subscription to be able to use it. It’s stupid that someone has to pay for motivation and inspiration to try and keep themselves from being depressed.
1,Aturnerindy,I signed up for a 3 day trial and it would automatically deduct for the yearly fee. Well needless to say I’ve only had it for one day and they’ve already charged me for a full year! So all in all I’m not impressed how misleading they are for the charges/billing practices.
2,the nickename was taken,"Not at one point did I get motivated because of this app, premium might have but there’s no sense in paying money for this, better off talking to a real person."

5,Jordyn226324,Nice app it’s an app where it can boost your confidence

5,History grad,Just what I needed for today an uplift for tiring day.
1,polarpopking,90% of these quotes aren’t quotes. The come off more like rambling self absorbed thoughts of a person who is not fully mature themselves. They seem like they just got out of a bad relationship or something.

2,harrypops1277,Deleting app because can’t stand the ads they throw in when you are in middle of absorbing a quote. Ads I get but these are just annoying and irrelevant
1,A mad person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The only thing you can really do is set how often you want reminders but this whole app is made up of ads and locked content. Just google inspirational quotes to save your time.

5,Danyelle Henry,Every day I look forward to reading inspiration!! It’s a blessing to my life!!!!
5,Beeson616,"I get a quote a day, and I love all of them! Would recommend."
1,JAX123A,You are essentially duped into paying an insane $35 for this thing when it makes it look like you are just swiping to the next screen. I’ll be disputing the charge if not removed tomorrow.

3,altagracia Tavarez,It’s good to see something that motivates u every day but most of them are constantly repeated
1,JungleSports,Apple TV app needs an update badly! Some options and controls would be nice. Being able to select a category and also save quotes at a minimum!!
5,lele_dabratt,So good
5,datboiijayyy,this app gets me thru my day.
3,03947471,"Unless you pay the subscription, the quotes are very repetitive."

5,2flyguy23,Helping with my depression
1,User10394,You can’t outright buy anything anymore. $20 a year isn’t a lot but the subscription model is a deal breaker. Especially when you only want to unlock one category.
2,FMFan614,Motivation shouldn’t be that expensive. I’m disappointed and I’m just going to stick with 0 motivation like i’m already am
1,litdeftones,"It’s funny that those things require you to purchase a subscription.   Being a woman is not something we got to opt into. It’s a default of our birth, why are you specifically charging women for women’s quotes by women for women?   But not African American or lgbt?   You don’t charge for race or sexual orientation quotes... but you charge for sex based quotes specifically women’s that were made for women.  I’m sure those women intended for that."

1,scammers are real,This app automatically bills your Apple account. You don’t have to confirm or check anything ever. It will automatically enroll you in the premium version of the app. Criminals. Religious motivational crooks

5,Snider_692,I love this app! It’s always gave me good and helpful sayings!
1,Carrie.Lala.5,This glitch is making me crazy. A quote pops up and I try to favorite it but a new quote pops up and I can’t find it anymore
1,JJONEN,"I ran two separate notification quote apps in my widgets for the past month.  These lack integrity, they are bland and basic.  After direct experience side by side go with Mantra app.    Way more heart and can intuit human creation more so than this cheap ai quote system.    No Go.  If anything it’s more obnoxious after a month of using it with an abundance of repeats  I highly suggest to Try a better one."
2,Mike Mongeau,"Should be able to specify specific topics, including “own mix” vs broad categories."
1,Grewts,I am a small young woman and i am looking for quote for motivation. These quotes theyre  giving me are super bad and i dont understand. Its so free and it makes me sad that I downloaded tjis app and iy dont even work. Helppppo. Xome onnnn fix it plwaseeee 😡🧢🧢

1,xXZombieMunterXx,It delivers on daily quotes but they’re all really lame and unmeaningful. They all just feel kinda shallow. You’d get the same level of meaningfulness from a motivational cat poster. But since there’s no cat it’s way lamer.

1,tAyLoR- SwIfT THIRTEEN,A really good app seeing that it was free but I never like an app that wants you to buy subscriptions to do something that should be included in the app- such as see quotes you’ve favorited or search certain topics.

5,ChloroxBleachKilledBenny,this app honestly helps me get through my days and is a great reminder of your self worth ❤️
1,Mz AP,It’s cool but it really should be FREE OR way less than $20 a year because the quotes are someone else’s ideas and thoughts that you’re charging for that they probably aren’t getting a piece of the pie anyway!
3,urgodx24,Why pay for something that’s so post to help people
5,chelle2016,I REALLY love how I could personalize the frequency and types of motivational quotes.

5,Herikdboi,"It all worth it, thumbs up👍"
5,Cheaky19,GOOD SHTUFF!
1,😼🧸,Subscription for everything. Can’t even be motivated nowadays without having to pay money. Was once free and amazing now it’s costly and lame.

1,mosman1800,When I go to my profile then general it pops up an ad then take me to the Home Screen after the ad.
1,sump19xx,Sounds great and helpful until you go to set it up and then they want to charge you. This should have been free to help people but they just want money.

1,jdang1996,This app doesn’t offer a lot unless you pay for it monthly and I’m definitely not paying to get notifications. Deleting.
3,ashtyn smith12321,It’s good but you have to pay for the other options but it does work for me.
2,SAM MD2B,$30 is a ridiculous amount to pay for a lifetime premium purchase. I mean it’s a nice app but it’s quotes at the end of the day.

5,Dnld. Trump,So meaningful and beautiful quotes. So inspirational and uplifting I love it
2,Nicknames aren’t the best idea,"I think this app does have good quotes and advice in it. But in my experience of having premium for nearly a year now, that doesn’t really change how questionable this app can be sometimes. I think the biggest issue is the constantly conflicting nature of the notifications I receive. One notification will be saying to remember to be kind and care for others, then the next will be basically saying “no one matters in your life except you”. One notification will say “remember no one is perfect, accept people as they are”, then the next will say “if anyone slightly inconveniences you, cut them out of your life entirely” (I’m not even exaggerating, there’s literally a quote that says if anyone causes you stress, cut them out of your life). The straws that broke the camel’s back for me were two notifications I received yesterday and today, respectively. Yesterday I got one that said, verbatim, “Nobody cares, work harder.” What? In what world would telling someone “nobody cares” motivate them to work harder?? And then today I received “Please cancel my subscription to your issues.” That just sounds so selfish and narcissistic. Why would I ever say that to anyone?? It’s an understandable feeling if someone is only using you as a fill-in therapist, but regardless that’s STILL something you shouldn’t say to them as oftentimes those people really just need help and don’t know how else to go about it. And even so, that doesn’t happen often enough for that to be a “motivating quote”. It just sounds so entitled and self-centered. Humans are meant to carry each other’s burdens. People that can’t handle the fact that others are struggling are insufferable. So… I guess my review is that yes, there are good quotes/advice that actually DO provide motivation, but oftentimes the quotes can be contradicting and quite honestly infuriating. Premium isn’t worth the money, and you’d be better off finding motivational quotes online and creating a personal collection to read every now and then. Maybe create custom notifs for yourself if you really want motivational notifs. This app becomes less worth downloading over time."
5,Unknown#269,Should be free

5,Connie 😍,i love this app! it sends me motivating quotes that help keep going throughout the day! high recommend:)
5,Queen Justine,"This is officially the first time I have ever reviewed an app, and Motivation is the app that is worth it! Please let me say right off that I am a real customer and not affiliated with them in any way 😊  I started with the free version, and that alone gives you so many options as far as categories of quotes and affirmations and backgrounds. You only have to watch a tiny little ad for a few seconds and then experiment to your heart’s desire! This kept me happy and playing around for weeks!   I decided to subscribe because I wanted to unlock all of the content and backgrounds, and it is worth every bit of the fee! I literally use this app throughout the day, every day, and I have seen and felt and have documented a shift in my depression and anxiety for real.   The sayings and quotes are always relevant and useful, no matter if you are using this app for mental health self care, encouragement or true motivation and support to achieve your goals.   We all know that affirmations are supposed to be helpful, but sometimes it feels like too much to start writing in your journal or pick up a book when you feel all the way down emotionally or physically.  I have a friend in Italy who is an athlete, and she uses this app in completely different ways than I do, which tells me that it is useful to a huge range of people!   You can set this app so it literally sends you a quote to your phone, and you can set the number of times a day you want to receive them. It’s so automatic that I am reading more affirmations and great quotes than I would in any other form or any other app where I would have to search around. This app literally does it for you!  The interface could not be easier to use, and when I had a question about a particular background and font I wanted, they got back to me in a day with concrete answers and friendly help! Customer service is excellent!   Thank you so much to the Motivation team, and to people thinking about trying this app, I recommend super highly that you take a chance on it!!! 👍👍👍"

1,Le Levidawg,"This app is awesome. The ability to add photos to the widget is really nice, completes my phones aesthetic. Beyond that there is a huge pool of quotes, so the odds of getting any recurring quotes is unlikely. It’s nice to open up your phone and get a new inspiration quote each time.  However... The reason I’m giving this a negative review is for two reasons. Reason one: The app in itself is simple to design, as a programmer myself it wouldn’t take much time at all to make. The most complex aspect of this app would definitely be it’s UI Design and artwork. A $20 yearly subscription for an app you don’t even get to own is ridiculous. However I’m sure people out there still pay for it with the crazy notion that it’s worth it.  Reason two: I signed up for the free 3 day premium trial and it was making me watch adds after less than 24 hours of signing up. Would have liked to explore some of its features more before being pushed into paying the $20 a year. An app that sends you a motivational message with and a simple widget with customizable artwork for $20, which is a yearly subscription. You don’t even get to own the app. There are cheaper apps on the App Store which are much more affordable and a lot more complex at later stages in development than this app.  Until this app adds more features to match its absurd price tag or reduces its subscription costs and fixes the free trial bug, my rating will remain the same. $20 is a lot for some people, the app is a great concept. It could be a staple on everyone’s phone if it is marketed correctly👍"

4,Doug4001,"THE “MOTIVATION” APP IS AMAZING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE DETAIL.......THERE IS A VERY, VERY, VERY, LIMITED SELECTION OF THEMES!   ###PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, TAKE THE TIME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ADDING AS MANY DIFFERENT “THEMES” AS POSSIBLE!!!  ***WHEN CONSIDERING THE ADDITION OF A MUCH LARGER VARIETY OF THEMES, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE SMALL SELECTION OF THEMES CURRENTLY OFFERED AT THIS TIME, ARE DESIGNED FOR MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES THAT SEND A “SOFT”, “INNER PEACE” & “HAPPY SUNSHINE“ TYPE OF MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE.  DON’T GET ME WRONG, I AM NOT KNOCKING THIS GENRE IN ANYWAY & GREATLY ENJOY THESE TYPES OF MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES FOR THE CORRECT MOMENTS IN MY LIFE!     ***I ALSO NEED HOWEVER, A LARGE SELECTION OF THEMES DESIGNED FOR MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES THAT SEND A MESSAGE OF “STRENGTH”, “DETERMINATION”, “INNER POWER” & “WILL TO KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THE ODDS”!!!   CURRENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE, POSSIBLY TWO, THEMES THAT EVEN COME CLOSE TO FITTING MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES LIKE THIS.  PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER PROVIDING THESE TYPES OF THEMES WITH A VARIETY OF “STRONG FONTS”, DESIGNED TO GO ALONG WITH MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES SUCH AS THIS.      ***I BELIEVE THE “MOTIVATION” APP WOULD APPEAL TO A MUCH LARGER VARIETY OF CLIENT BASE IF YOU WERE TO ADD THESE STRONGER THEMES, IN TURN, PROVIDING YOU A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF APP DOWNLOADS & SUBSCRIPTIONS!     PARTICULARLY, A MUCH LARGER “TRADITIONAL MALE” CLIENT BASE.    ***FINALLY, PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER PROVIDING A VARIETY OF “MINIMALIST” PLAIN COLOR THEMES IN A LARGE VARIETY OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT COLORS.     ###THE “MOTIVATION” APP IS “THE“ BEST APP I HAVE EVER FOUND FOR CREATING & POSTING MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES!   IT IS NOT MY INTENT TO DISCREDIT OR TEAR THE APP DOWN.    I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE MY INPUT ON WHAT I FEEL COULD ELEVATE THE APP FROM SIMPLY BEING A GOOD APP, TO BECOMING THE GREATEST & MOST ELITE MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE APP EVER!!!  IN MY OPINION, THE “MOTIVATION“ APP TRULY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A MAINSTREAM APP AS POPULAR AS “FACEBOOK” & “INSTAGRAM” THAT IS A MUST HAVE APP EVERYONE WILL WANT TO DOWNLOAD & SUBSCRIBE TO!!!    BEST REGARDS,   -DOUGLAS FRENCH"

5,B-BRENZ,"Why I'm actually taking time to write a review for this amazing app:  First and foremost, I rarely ever find myself navigating away from an app upon being prompted to rate it in the App Store. There are very few apps that have wowed me to the extent where I found them worthy of a rating, let alone a 5-star rating.  To that end, this app fulfilled my (jaded) criteria for what it means to earn a 5-star rating. I frequently find myself surfing the web, usually starting on the standard Google search page and typing in ambiguous phrases in hopes of finding a quote that is, not only representative of what kind of quote I'm looking for (e.g., quotes about courage, love, perseverance, etc.), but also credible in terms of the name attached to the quote (e.g., Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Ernest Hemingway, etc.). Unfortunately, I tend to find myself amidst a sea of webpages, none of which ever really yield a 100% satisfactory result. The layout of this app is user friendly; the organization scheme is impeccably designed; the simplicity is satisfying; and the near lack of distracting ads make this app debatably the best inspirational/proverbial app on the market. Simply put, after using this app, you won't want to put it down, and, more importantly, you'll be satisfied 100% of the time."
5,Revof666,"Perfect for a quick pick-me-up! I've been using this app for well over three years, now- I'd originally only started with skimming through the quotes, just for the mPoints. But the past year or so, I've found myself looking forward to reading the inspirational quotes, and I have also begun memorizing a good number of them!  What's even greater, is that there have been a few quotes that must've slipped someone's eye- because I have come across quite a few, that are just downright comical. Love it!"
5,Sboogie14,I like the collection of motivational quotes this app has to offer from various figures in history. The subtle reminders that the app sends to your phone notifications are great and non invasive as some other reminder apps have been. I enjoy this app for the peace and beauty captured in the quotes people viewed the world as at one time. I also look forward to its future content
3,Summer Lynn83,"I have always liked to hear or see different quotes from people. This app has wonderful quotes from some people I don't even know. Plus, quotes from some of my favorite people. My only wish is that there were more quotes in the app. That said, I don't feel quite as good about this app as I use to. Every time I click to see more quotes by the second quote up pops an ad. I understand why people use ads in free apps, but there were way too many of them at once. I still like this app, but I would like to see less ads and more quotes please. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
5,Your girlfriend 🤗😍,"The motivator app is amazing!! I have never came across the same quote once. These quotes are perfect to screenshot, post as Instagram caption, or just admire. I've never had any trouble with this app. If you want notifications at a certain time;This is the perfect app to get. If you are having trouble staying positive, I would 100% recommend this app! There is no doubt you will not enjoy this app!"
4,BestR3vi3ws,"This app is what every person needs if they lack motovation in my life, I single handedly went from 0 followers on Instagram to 101 in a month or so. Definitely good for inspiring others, but the app does have a few minor flaws that need fixing. The major one I will point our is the notification glitch, I will get a notification of a great quote but when I click on it it will bring me to a whole new quote. Fix this please!"
5,Kickoff fkofdbbjgartyhhdedvo,"The motivation I find behind this app is unreal. You just set the timer for how many notifications you want per day then just go about your day. It's that simple; and whether you think you need it or not, it's always nice to take a moment when you get that notification to just think about life and the inspiration that Author most have found in their life too."
5,Melissa Pearl,"I love the app for what it's for I've been using it for about 8 months and true nothing is going to fix your problems but you but it's cool to see quotes however many times a day until whatever time you need to keep you going. Design changes are minor and since I first started using it there have been a lot more quotes added.   ""HAPPINESS IS WHEN WHAT YOU THINK, WHAT YOU SAY, AND WHAT YOU DO ARE IN HARMONY."" -MAHATMA GANDHI"
4,Gonzo-the-Great,"I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a well-intentioned, free app. I used it for a while, then deleted it when the problems took away from the benefits. The daily reminders feature is a nice addition. Some of the quotes, however, are slightly inaccurate, misattributed, etc. Some have no author listed and some feel like fortune cookies.  As others have suggested, I think a feature that lets you add your own quotes would be welcome, here."
5,PillGrimm79,This app has completely changed my life. I went from smoking bad things and living under a bridge to owning two homes and running a successful corporation literally over night. If you don't download this app then I hope you are happy with mediocrity for the remainder of your days on this earth.
5,Strong n sexy,It's short to the point like anything it's not perfect with minor errors in spelling. But you get the Point. Some quotes maybe from people you know some may not it's a great opportunity to learn about who they are. It post right to Facebook or Twitter with the touch of a button. If you like me and can't keep a good thing to yourself!
5,NinaRose23,"No matter the background or update changes, the words of the motivational quotes are true no matter the time or day! The keep me inspired and remind me constantly that whatever the change you want to see in your life, you alone have the power to make it happen!"
5,ThanksForTheMotivation123456,"This app is honestly the best when it comes to motivation. Whenever I feel like I can't do something, I come to this and it's amazing! It gives great quotes from influential people and some not very influential people. For the future, though, maybe the design of the quotes  could be altered with different settings...?"
5,iRecklessEbony,I always need the extra motivation and the continuous reminders that allow you to toggle between how often you wish to receive them is absolutely great! I also like that it doesn't give me the false impression that I'm getting a text message.
5,Lgomeski,"The quotes are always boosting me to do my best with a positive attitude. Every once in a while they'll throw in a quote that's not motivating at all and just hilarious. It makes me realize I shouldn't take life so seriously all the time. For example, ""When life gives you lemons, turn around and throw them at people."" Haha"
4,Meh💋❤️,It helps me get through my days!!! Lots of times I'm down or mad or sad and I read a quote and it just lightens my mood!!! Even when I'm happy it helps me to be a little happier or even to stay the same amount of happy all day!!! And that's hard for me!!! I'm not a huge people person so when I have to be out and about around people it reminds me to stay sane!!!🤘✌🏻️😍😘🔥👅
5,Skwirl's Jazzy,"I am a person who needs to be reminded to keep pushing no matter what, and it isn't the case every day, but most days this app sends me a quote and it is exactly the little push I needed to be my best that day! Thanks for this app"
5,SouthernGirl461,"Most of the quotes are great motivation ones, there are a few that are questionable whether they are motivation or not. But, this app gives you easy mPoints. You can share the quotes on Instagram, Facebook, or save them to your camera roll or Dropbox."
5,Satchmoe25,I love this app! The motivational quotes have really helped me to get through some bad moments and days. Could definitely use more of a variety but it is nice to read the same quotes repeatedly cause of the truth some of them hold on a daily basis. Mpoints are definitely a plus!
5,Jounirstezz,I was looking for something to remind me every day on why i should keep going forward and i found this perfect app which sends me at least 15 motivating quotes throughout the day ! I definitely recommend this app
3,Ahsianneko,"I love this app so much! I made it so it sends me  5 quotes throughout the day, and all of a sudden it stops!!!  I go back into the app, and the settings are all the same :( and it still doesn't send me my quotes.  I deleted and reinstalled the app and it word for a few days but stopped afterwards. :( i guess i have to open the app manually now"
2,FlashZ91,"The app is alright. There aren't very many quotes to go through, to have to put up with the constant pop-up ads that make it rather annoying to use. They popped up a lot less before the app's font was changed, and I prefer the other font as well, but that's a personal opinion. The reason for my 2-star review is the constant ads that pop up, which I have no interest in."
5,DaRandomKookie,Not only can I look at multiple quotes they all are so inspirational...I just got over a breakup(we were dating for almost a year) and looking at these quotes build my self confidence after he dumped me fore someone prettier😭 This app inspires me everyday and I truly love it.
2,D Monkee,"The concept is quite simply awesome. I love the simplicity. I love the notifications.   I hate that when I click on the quote in the notifications the app opens with a different quote. And there's no way to search to find the one you want. I have received a few quotes in my notifications that I would love to save or share, but can't.  I give this two stars bc the hate part annoys me more than I love the good parts."
5,—Matilda,"I'm surrounded by too many negative people, this definitely helps me stay focused and positive. I have so many goals and it's too easy to get caught in the negative of everything. This has become one of my must have apps :-), sorry haters!"
5,kelsschn,"Seriously, this app is everything. It encourages even on my best days. A constant pick me up when I didn't even know I was down. And especially essential when I'm down and need to be lifted up."
5,ashleykrystal25,I love the fact that it has a setting to remind you as many times as you want. The quotes are great some are funny but it will always pick you yo when you feel down. 💛💛💛
3,J_Cat55,"I enjoy reading these everyday, but can you give us the option to choose font, font color and background color. The starkness of the white on black actually hurts my eyes. Also it would be nice to have a ""back"" options. There are times I wish I could go back and read a quote again."
5,cafedrmr,I really liked the black background and white text of the old free version rather than the pink and distressed text look. Will likely delete and look for another motivation/quote app! Bummer!
5,eggiecom1,"I love this app. The sayings are quite pithy, although I've heard some of them before. Kind of starting to see repeats, so I think an upgrade with more sayings is needed. Mostly, however, I can enjoy them and get M-Points, too!"
3,Theron F,"1: some of the quotes are kind of weird and not very ""inspirational""...?  2: NEED the ability to add my own backgrounds from my camera roll.  With these two changes, the app would probably be 5 stars easily. It does exactly what I need for now, although yes, it could be improved."
2,Texas Yankee,"Generally good quotes. However why are they all displayed in upper case? Also, the daily quote that shows up in notifications is NOT the daily quote displayed when you use same to go to and open the app. And not least; no way is provided to communicate with the developer save for what I'm trying to here in this review."
5,Sheysss,It's an extraordinary app that gives you confidence and bravery while also making you understand the aspect of humility that goes a long way in our lives.
5,Zpweston,"A little quote can come at just the right time, it's an app that has one function and that's to remind you to keep pushing. To keep bettering yourself and motivate others."
5,catniptoy,Every morning I would reach for my phone and read emails and social media. I wanted something to start things off on a better note. This is perfect.
4,monkeyreeves,I love the motivational quotes and have to pull myself away from reading all of them.. Good stuff! Not as many annoying ads.. Mpoints are ok.. Not as many as others but this really has great content! Enjoy!
5,Spaliff09,"This app has been very inspiring and uplifting! I really enjoy looking at it each day. The only thing that could be improved, and just a personal preference, when the app is exited, the quote changes."
5,nikkifrat,You can set up how much motivation you want for each day/week etc. The quotes and thoughts are very moving! I look forward to them popping up on my phone.
5,Gmail4eva,"Just what I wanted - motivational quotes sent to me throughout the day. Much needed for those with big goals, who are entrepreneurs or anyone needing motivation. You can choose how many quotes are sent to you per day."
5,Modifiears.com,"The quotes and motivational phrases always seem to pop up at the right time for me. So much better than other ""motivational"" apps that barely have anything prevalent or inspiring."
3,JustJonas's IPOD,"Overall the application is fantastic. Very inspirational and uplifting. Love the notification settings where it reminds you of the daily reminders.  Bad side is when the notifications pop up, the app opens to a different message.   Overall, great App!"
5,Go church,"There is always good quotes that boost your motivation and I look forward to it many days.   I'm not a bot writing this Lol!  I say that cause I think bots write some reviews, but this one is not fake! No fake reviews here!"
5,Ethanator_0,"I was going to run a 4 mile race, and I was thinking ""I gotta get motivated here"" So I got this and started staring at the stuff for half an hour Then I won the thing So thnx"
2,GingerSnaps94,"Sometimes Spell Check isn't enough. You don't get knocked off your ""feed"" but Spell Check wouldn't notice it, since feed is spelled right. It's the wrong word. I've seen little mistakes like this one, every once in a while on this app. You have a Larry Bird quote that has 00% instead of 100%. It's simply data entry and editing."
4,Pharmboy1603,"I enjoy the concept of this Ap.  However, it seems to me they could provide more quotes from different sources.  They recirculate many of the quotes.  Can be shared with friends via camera and Instagram."
5,WhoWhat4,I think it's good mental conditioning to hear truth in a variety of ways. I am not a big app person but I do use this one more than most.
5,Have I seen you before?,"It just always seems to know when I need a little up lifting, at the perfect time and the perfect amount. Thank you."
5,Brittanyz123,"Every single quote is better than the last. Great and powerful, will change your bad mood and give you hope!"
5,tkelly261,Some days this app is the difference between getting back up and staying down.
5,Inqubu5,It's a great get up and go when you need it. It also helps push yourself more when you don't need it.
3,Jclark0156,"When I click on the notification on my iPhone it won't even take me to the app, then when I open the app it brings me to a whole new quote instead of letting me view the one that was sent to me! Its very frustrating!"
3,nob0dy343,"I would not rave about this app but it is what it is. It is an app that gives you quotes that seem inspirational or motivational.  In my opinion they are just quotes from various individuals. Its not bad, buts not good either in my opinion. Therefore, i have it my standard 3 star review."
5,Checker53,When ever you feel down you can always use some inspiration in your day
5,JohnCooper2002,"Just when you feel overworked and could use a ""pick me up"", I get a pop up message with a wonder ful inspirational message!!"
5,riizil Wayne,This is a beautiful app which helps and build one from nothing to something.. it has helped me a lot. Try it too
5,SashaSayy,"I am such a motivator & moved by words! This app is everything, I read the quotes out loud to whoever is around. Everyone can use some encouragement every now & again!"
5,AnonymousMeMystery123,"I'm pretty sure I've never given any app my review. But, this one deserves a thumbs up 👍🏽 and a round of applause 👏🏽, because it's definitely one of my favorites thus far."
5,Music lover 4 life's,This app is wonderful it keeps me in a positive light and reminds me to stay positive throughout my day and I my opinion it doesn't get any better then that!!
1,Jensen emManen,I had this app set up to give me a quote twice a day. First few days were good. It started giving me the same quotes and then eventually stopped giving me quotes at all. I actually forgot it was installed until I had went through and deleted some apps I wasn't using anymore. Needless to say this was one of the apps to go.
4,Goldy428,Really like the app. My only issue is that it seems that they certain quotes that repeat over & over again. Would like to see more added to the app.
5,Raritynyou,"It's so easy to get mpoints with this app, I haven't entered a sweepstakes yet or applied for any of the gift cards because I'm building up a lot of points but this app is awesome! And the quotes are great!"
5,Zebra Owl Sky,"Good variety of motivation quotes, nice interface to save quotes to camera roll or share on social media, and a fun way to earn some additional mPoints every day"
3,PhotoMav3n,Only 3 stars because the quote in the notifications are different from the ones that come up when clicked and there is no way to search for it.
4,XxshinsaixX,I'm going through a though time right now and these quotes make me have hope. But there are many in-app purchases that I would like to use
5,Rockstar4Life20,A few are interesting.
5,Jlcase,Some days you just need to read something to help your day go along. This app has been perfect for that!
5,Looshcadoosh,This app is truly life changing. I may not have made it through my tough times as easily without this app. Thank you so much!!!!!
5,RGregson,Great app! The app makes it easy to share with your friends and family.
5,Sandi Morris,I love all the quotes and Mpoints I'm getting on this app and judging by the likes and favorites on my Social Media accounts many of my friends are too.
5,***LARS***,I've tried many other apps and this one definitely delivers. I like the variations and quality of it all.
5,LUFTAUFT,A good way to start your day by reading a motivating quote or phrase. Also a good way to end the day after a particularly bad day.
4,RosaEnora,"I love the app, however, miiight want to edit some of you quotes in there. Bill Cosby's motivational sayings do not allow the same go getting inspiration as they once might have."
5,Quantumatic,This app is simple and perfect and nice surprise however many times a day you choose to be motivated  thank you

1,aegrimmly,Didn’t know I was being charged and got charged for a months worth. And after I saw the charge I canceled it and it took away my month I got charged for so I paid $29.99 for a months worth and canceling it it took it away and got totally charged and taken advantage of from that and no refund from apple! RIDICULOUS
3,dreamlikediana,I wish there was a dislike button for the questionable quotes. There are quite a bit. They feel very insensitive when I’m going through something and I’m staring at them like WHAT THE F—-?! Also $29.99 for a year is absurd. I could understand $10-15 a year but anything above that is a no. I’m using the free version but the insensitive quotes make me feel like deleting the app entirely.
1,Aleigh . (: ,"Signed up for a 3 day trial to see if the quotes were any good, of course I got charged $29.99 on the 3rd day for an annual subscription-ridiculous! The quotes are a little on the cheesy side for me, I was looking more for professional development type of motivational quotes. Which I assume is what a free trial is for… of course now I can’t cancel it and I’m out over $30 including tax. Who charges this much for some cheesy quotes!?! I’m so frustrated with these apps tricking people like this. Buyer beware."
1,J'Stacks,They were charging me monthly for a year subscription of $14.99 👎🏾 Watch your subscriptions closely
1,Cayche,If it’s a free 3 days trial then why automatically charge the 29.99 at the being of the “free 3 day trial” I don’t know if I even like the app and I’m paying for something I’ve never tried before. That’s scamming people smh
5,RolandShaw11,"This app acts as your daily friend that supports you in your fearless quests with relatable and inspiring nuggets of wisdom of ancient and recent past.  There can be no external separate form or entity that can give you the free rein or persistent nudges 24/7/365.  Because it starts from inside you, when you make that commitment to yourself, only you can be kind to yourself even when the whole world is on fire.  This app, is that commitment you make to be kind to yourself through it all."
5,by jubgbnjjjjhbv,This app has really helped me and motivated me.it’s amazing it can help with growth self esteem and motivation.I really recommend this to anyone who is struggling.
1,Kswizzygetbizzy,I’ve been using this app for at 3 in a half years and they’ve gotten even more greedier by the day I mean every time I check this app now and then the prices just go up just for quotes like….bruh. Of course you have stuff to use that are free but it’s the bare minimum and it’s limited it’s all locked behind payments everything now I would not support this app at all. What once was good has all gone down the drain into greedy pigs looking to make a quick buck this is why American companies are fallen they too goddamn greedy
4,Jfy180,"I love the widgets, and I bought the full self-care bundle, but I get logged out of premium features daily.it makes it less pleasant and convenient to use - which is the whole point!"
4,onehunned%,"This is a good app, I like this app. I appreciate how many quotes there are that cover any topic, and that you can change font and background. I am not a fan that you can only change the style of the quotes once or twice, and then after you have to pay. Itd be cool if there were like backgrounds you had to watch ads for to get, and then some of them you had to pay, but not all of them. I like that you can change the app icon, but again, after you change it when you choose it, you have to pay to change it again. I do not like that some of the quotes have bad words, I haven’t had anything terrible the only ones I’ve gotten so far are the D word, A word, and B word, and also it does not seem like a Christian app which bugs me a bit, but I mainly just ignore the quotes that go against what I believe. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that you can make your own quotes and that you can add quotes to collections but you don’t have to save them to your photos or anything, although you can if you want to. I use this app daily and it has actually helped me to feel more confident with the self esteem quotes, and I like the variety of topics of quotes too. You do have to pay for specific topics but honestly I don’t really care about that because I just pick outta the “free today” and I’m set. Normally I just stick with one topic for a couple months even, and the ones in the “free today” section are always the ones I’m looking for, never had a problem with that. I like that it’s set up how like TikTok is, where you can look at a quote, double-tap to like, and then swipe up for the next quote. I also like that if you sign in and choose your username, some of the quotes make it so it’s addressed to your username. I think it’s kinda weird at the same time I like it. So mainly I love this app I use it so much I find it helpful (most of the time) and can find myself just scrolling through quotes for a while, it’s pretty entertaining tbh. However, it does have a “daily quote” limit, where after you scroll for enough, you have to pay to look at more quotes, not including the ones you’ve already saved. I actually like that feature because I could sometimes scroll for FOREVER if I’m bored enough and it’s like it gives me a limit like it’s saying “kay thats enough go do smthg productive” if you know what I mean. I haven’t tried any of their other apps and I don’t plan to but I do quite like this one so I’m giving 4 stars. Ty for taking time to read this hope this helped your decide if you wanna get this 😊🤗"
2,thtchick;),"I been paying for $14.99 for premium for a few years as the free version is very basic and generic. However, the price has doubled despite no notable changes. I have to constantly reopen the app to get the quotes to show up on my widget. Plus I still get ads for the app itself while scrolling through quotes like I’m not paying the subscription. For twice the money I expect more than just a quotes repository. Though the quotes are inspiring, it’s not worth the price when I could always look up them up for free online."
5,Jane DeTalente,I was prompted to buy the subscription for the year for 29.99 which I declined. Then I was prompted to purchase the year for $14.99 which I did. Then I was charged the full price. I am not happy about this. I was going to buy a lot more of their apps but if this is how they do business I am going to cancel everything from their company. I tried reaching out to them but they do not make it easy to contact them. Their help links say the links are disconnected. Not sure what is going on with the company.
5,Mendy Jo,"This app is so nice.It has no glitches and it grants you a lot of choices for how the quote looks like and even how the app looks like.The quotes encourage me everyday,I 10/10 recommend it."

5,Avangalyna,This app helps me with my depression and anxiety.it helps me with my mental health issues too.
5,Californicorey,"I am Not a big believer in paid apps/paid subscriptions within an app, but ‘Motivation’ is a huge exception to that. I’ve been using it for a couple years now; it works on my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and my 🍎Watch 8. It’s extremely simple, but it does the job with perfection every day. You can even choose to have it spit out quotes from a specific category like “Self Esteem” or Relationships if u need a bit extra love in one such area for a few days. I highly recommend “Motivation” to Anyone and EVERYONE ages 12-112. I Personally guarantee that it will improve your outlook on life, your health, happiness, and confidence. Don’t just take MY word for it, try it now!!!!!!🥰😇😊😊🫶🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
4,notabunchaanimalsinacoat,"$19.99 is always too much for a monthly subscription, and pretty much 95% of the app is locked behind it, so i am speaking as a free user. still great, but lower the price for premium."
5,Brandhaus,"I have so much suffering these days. Mental health, dog has cancer, I worked my butt off to basically set up retirement by age of 40. I then had a mental break down, spent all my money, and now live with my parents watching my dog die. Other than that I have no one. No family, no kids. So just these simple motivational quotes help me push through. I save so many of them. Once in awhile I’ll watch something motivating on YouTube, but I feel like they all say the same thing after awhile. None talk about mental health and what a struggle that some days even to brush my teeth is hard. I can’t work anymore because I’ll have good days followed by multiple horrible days where I can’t get out of bed. Anyway, this app is so simple and though it won’t change your life, it gives you that “spark” that may help you as it has me."
3,cluck chicken cluck cluck,"I really enjoyed the app when I first downloaded it. After a few months the quotes started becoming more negatively aggressive than motivating and supportive. I get that toxic people should be removed from my life. And boundaries are important to protect myself from harm. But everyday lately, it’s just leave them, cut people out. Stop chasing people who don’t love you. I have not had a single quote recently that was loving, compassionate or helpful.  It’s unfortunate that the app named Motivation is bringing me down. I am removing it from my device after I send this review.   Please do better."
1,Lucas Boyett,"This app would be an amazing tool for my mental health if it actually worked as intended. I have made personalized choices and settings for notifications, and yet it doesn’t do it. I don’t understand why it doesn’t, but it seems like it worked right in the beginning and then after I paid for it, it stopped working correctly. I’d love to give it a higher rating, but I’m currently not satisfied with it.  As of 10/09/2023, the notifications still don’t work properly even after reducing the amount of notifications that I get.  If it wasn’t for the fact that I have the app widget on my phone screen, I would have completely forgotten that I have it.  I still maintain that after I paid for a year subscription that it stopped working properly.  Yes, they have reached out to try and help, but so far nothing works."
5,Tiff_oj,"I have been trying to work through my problems,and haven’t been trying to feel insecure or down.So this app really helps me through out the days that’s been the hardest. -so i thank you for this app.💗"

3,Nicknamesound,"It’s nice to have the ability to have my favorite motivational quotes on my Home Screen, but the randomized quotes are very weird and honestly aren’t motivation. I’ve gotten a quote that said, “Keegan, save yourself for the ones who really love you. Not everyone deserves to know who you really are”. That makes no sense. Hopefully the quotes are public though because if so maybe you all will see quotes from the Bible, Jordan Peterson, Shi Heng Yi and the stoics that I’ve put in there."
1,molo90210,"Absolutely loved this app until recently.After watching countless ads today, a giant ad popped up where the quotes should be and you can’t see anything. Don’t waste your time downloading this unless you have $20 or 20 extra min for ad time.🙄"

4,MaggieKnows,I do like the app. What I don’t like is the auto play adds for other apps that just pop up. I would consider buying the app to avoid that but unfortunately haven’t seen a pop up option for an annual fee. Not a fan of monthly subscriptions.  Update 10/21/22  I decided to purchase the subscription. The variety of Motivational Quotes are amazing. We all can use a little more encouragement and thoughtfulness in our lives. Money well spent.
5,Ohiobay,I use this app everyday.Thanks for making this app.
2,PunchyKM,"Don’t torture yourself by paying for premium and constantly struggling with troubleshooting inconsistent notifications. Update or redownload app, open app daily, change schedule, etc.. does not matter as you’ll be left in the same eventual place…notifications will stop working. I’m sure I’ll get a nice “we’re sorry your frustrated reply” which is great but just fix the app. It IOS has limits on notifications,  then time to revisit your code and strategy."
1,AndreiWatts,Fake Reviews Requires Annual Subscription
1,NYC_Cuba,What a joke. I’m sorry but to charge $20 for this is absurd. They’ve collected an encyclopedia of quotes from the internet and are charging you for it.  Anyone who wants motivation can text me for free and I’ll send you a quote from one of the many books I’ve read.
1,Megatha19,You’ll see it in the App Store as free and two weeks after download will be charged $19.99. I miss the days where I could download something for free like it says in the store and not have to worry about some fine print that automatically opted me in for a year of premium. Love the app otherwise.
4,VoliotKasi200012,"So, I have a lot of stress in my life right now and I JUST got the app, it helps me out after just a few scrolls. You don’t need the subscription for it to help out :)  If you get it then any stress you have might not go away but, it will tell you that “if you have something out of reach then let go, and it will eventually come to you” :) That quote helped me since, my parents took away my social media because, my brother is jealous that I’m more popular then on it.  He made up lies about my channel/accounts I had on TikTok, YouTube, instagram, + more :/  This app has thousands or even, MILLIONS of quotes that help out ;)  So, this is just an app that is optional to get but I suggest it :)"
4,Ajrennpanpan,"This app is super awesome, but I wasn’t aware I would be charged $19.99 It said I would be charged $1 something each month… I made sure to read everything out, if I had known I probably wouldn’t have signed up So that was a trap, kinda left a bad taste in my mouth 🥲 I have it for a year now I suppose."
5,VictoriaaaW,"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH , but I hate the ads.222many.Still love the app tho❤️."
5,cbes,"I’m not sure how I lucked upon this APP, but it came as I was recovering from some serious issues. I really want to forward everyone of the these quotes! I suffer from PTSD, and unfortunately, my granddaughter had a similar experience that caused her to have it also. I like the variety of topics, if I had the time, I would get every topic! Lol. I occasionally change topics. But have a few that are must haves. The price of $29.99/yr is a great price even when you are on a budget. Thank you for these, I encourage others to at least try the free trial."
5,MrsRayLee,I canceled my free trial prior to it ending but was still charged $19.99 and I’m unable to cancel and get a refund. I’m not happy with this “motivation” app.
5,23dancer23,"I love this app so much it has changed my entire attitude towards life, I do think that maybe you could have the choice to see other peoples folders like on Spotify where u can make it private or public and the same with the quotes you can add. Other than that this app is rly amazing"

The subscription ended on the 3rd of April todays date is May 4th an the app is still trying to pull money from my card way after I canceled the trial & now it want let me use my card bc it’s saying I have to pay $14.99 for a app I canceled out an no longer have on my phone. I can’t even upgrade my iCloud account bc your app is still trying to pull $14.99 from my account. Can y’all do something about this matter bc I’m not able to use my card until this matter is handled. Thank Y’all"

1,MarisalivesfortheKing,Downloaded this app for daily motivational quotes. After a day or two I decided it wasn’t for me and deleted the app. I just checked my bank account today and seen a charge for $19.99 and didn’t know where this charge came from. I called apple support and they told me that this app charged me!!! What? I did not sign up for any premium motivation and I don’t even know who would pay that much for a daily quote ?? Scam.
4,DahvissAngel,"The app truly helps a lot unfortunately I can’t at this time pay $20 for a year. I understand my mental health is just as important as my physical health but it’s just a little costly at this time.. however, the app it’s self is really amazing and has a lot of good points! I really wish it was a little less expensive then I could get it.. maybe $11.99 would be more affordable. It’s just a hard time for everyone right now. But I love your app and appreciate all the time, effort and hard work put into it!"

3,melissakd88,I’m having issues removing my subscription I should be able to have a cancel button option in my Apple ID settings and subscription section and I can’t remove the app and I don’t recall singing up for it again and I got charged $19.99 for the year and I have no way of reaching anyone to remove this issue  I do love the motivation but wish it was easy to cancel when broke

3,Jeremiah-B,You have to pay $19.99 a year to have someone tell you to have a good day. That’s the only downfall otherwise it’s good.
5,DiscipleWest,"This app is great for people who believe in having a positive mindset and people who know they will be successful. You have to pay to get the most out of this app but it’s very inexpensive for the value it provides, only like $3 a month or $19.99 for the year. You can easily save any quotes or statements into your photos."

5,SavyB1,"I LOVE this app. I am a huge quotes person, so when I saw this app, and their “I Am” app, I had to try it out and I am so thankful I did. I love it so much, and I love editing the fonts, pictures to choose from, etc. I wish you didn’t have to pay monthly to get everything, but hopefully can finically get to that point. I love the “free quotes today” bc they aren’t always free and they hold some valuable advice, quotes and encouragement for you to read! I love this app so much.  Also please make it for Android users too!!! I have a friend who would LOVE this app so much but they don’t have an Apple phone."
5,good?bad?maybe?,So I just got this and I am 9 and the only thing that I’m worried about is the 19.99 an year because I got this on oct not May in May it’s my Bday so I might convince my mom to give 2 dollars for allowance but other then that I love this aready

5,Yassy 💋,I really love this app . they are always on point ‘ at the right time . I send this app to everybody I know ‘ because this app is definitely a must have . you can pick the topic of the quotes you would like to receive ‘ or you can just pick all or random …. This is definitely one of my favorite apps ‼️
2,c.fink,"All I want this app to do is match the widget to the quote inside the app. But they’ve made it too complicated. A lot of times I’ll open the app to favorite what I see on a widget, close the app, and the quote changes. If I open the app again I can’t scroll back to recover and redisplay the quote and often times the widget will change again! UGH.  Personally, I think the overly complicated widget function needs to go away entirely. It should just match whatever quote and background graphic is set inside the app at any given moment. It’s like they’ve duplicated features, but why would I want my widget to be different form the app? Too many quotes! And they change all the time!  You know what would be nice? Let me set custom times to change quotes.  I sent an email to the company with the widget feedback. The answer I got was, “It can’t work this way — sorry 🤷🏼‍♂️.” I at least would’ve have liked to have heard an “I see what you mean” or “thanks for the feedback.” I mean… it’s code — you can do anything!"

5,Monster37 29,This is the best app if you’re struggling with some thing personally I love this app. I think this is the best app for people who have anxiety depression or other stuff. And I have only had this app for not even a week yet and I’m already falling in love with it.It’s good to wake up and look at positive things so you’re not so negative and it send In nice quotes and you can change it like general change it to depression anxiety haters morning sleep toxic relationships so you can get help to get out of it. I would get it a 10 out of 10 and I would totally buy everything with all my money on the app

1,Tgfziccan,"Have enjoyed the free version for many months…tucking away my “ favorites” for future reference and sharing. I watch the ads (knowing this is what gets the app revenue) and have never minded them.  This morning, I went to retrieve a favorite only to find out they are no longer available to me unless I pay for the premium service @ $19.99! What?!  I’ve only ever used “general” and “favorites” as I was NOT looking for a premium/custom experience. Now they want me to pay for MY favorites.  Rude."

5,abcdefghojksn,I’m a person who gets motivation from quotes❤️ I opened the app and it’s was quoted I could relate to and I love that! I’ve never wrote a review in my 21 years of life! I am in love with this ass😩 If you love quotes as much as me please download this🤞🏽 Promise you won’t regret it. I’m thinking about getting the premium. If the free version is this awesome I can’t wait to see the premium.
5,ReeseBS,"I absolutely love this app. Words cannot begin to describe how grateful I feel that this was developed and I feel like it were developed for me. There have been so many times when I have been in my head or been going through some thing or just had one of those days and I open my app or got a notification in that momentWith a message that spoke to me so loudly and so clearly and help get me through whatever it is that I was feeling and going through at that time. Every message that comes through to my phoneHas each and every single time for whatever reason been one that has had something to do with exactly what I was going through or am going through.This app has gotten me through good times, bad times, hard times, in times of joy. I don’t know what I would do without the motivation app. A special thank you to the developers and all the people who help this together you guys are doing a great job and a great thing for people who may need you or need to hear words of encouragement and dire times. Thank you all so much!"

5,kara1216182126,"I’ve been stressing a lot lately with school and other personal things and, this app really helped me gain my self respect and gain more motivation to do the things I love and has helped my anxiety in ways that nothing ever has + MORE! I definitely recommend if you’re going through tough times and think you won’t get through them, I put 30 quote notifications because I’m constantly not motivated so I recommend doing that if you choose to get this app. I believe that it’s worth the money however, I do see where some people are coming from when saying that “it’s too expensive” maybe the price should be lowered but it’s a great help, I think it’s worth it! I love reading through the quotes during my free time and I just feel sooo much better about myself & life. 1000000/10"

I feel I am being taken advantage of as I am unable to cancel this even when I sent in something from the app to have this CANCELED and my money refunded...I can’t find no way logical way to even cancel this as you make it a freaking maze to fine how to cancel. This is wrong on so many levels, SO MANY LEVEL... please cancel and refund my $21.31 ASAP!!! 😡  Sis. B. Kimbrough"

4,Joslyn!,"Please help. I absolutely love this app. I have the premium subscription for $19.99/year.  I received a notification not too long ago that said I could share my subscription with my Apple family members, but I haven’t been able to do so. I have family sharing enabled but it’s still asking them to pay for it. Anyone else have issues with this??"
1,kait4552,How do I contact them? I canceled during the 3 day trial & they still took 19.99.
1,Kawaii❤️❤️❤️,"Right off the bat, I hated that the advertisement for this app was for a 3-day free trial and then as soon as I downloaded it it charged me $12.99 for the first three days. The only thing I like about this though is a the fact that I can change my format for my inspirational quotes. Otherwise I really don’t like how you’re operating your app."
5,Julie 1974,I love this app!!! Worth the $20.00 for premium.
5,S. Ashworth,"I’m not a person who typically takes the time to write out a review for my apps. I’m more the, “tap a star to rate” kind of person. So the fact that I took the time to type out my opinion for an app typically means one of two things. Either the app is REALLY bad, or REALLY good. Thankfully this app is the latter, and this is why.           Let me start if by saying that I don’t own ANY paid apps. And, the only app subscription I have is for Apple tv. And that is only because it came free for a year when I got my iPhone 11. So, the only reason I downloaded this app to begin with, is because it was free.          Now, I wasn’t expecting much, as I have tried other quote apps, and they were extremely disappointing. My expectations were even lower when I saw that this app offered a “premium” version by paid subscription. I’m sure everyone has been duped by an app that’s “free”. You know, those apps you download, only to find out none of the features you want are available with paying for the “premium version”. 🙄  THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF APP!!!           I’m pleased to say that there are TONS of quotes, and categories (50+, including holiday themed categories) that are all included in the free version. Each of those categories has more quotes than you could view in one day.  Even if you spent all day clicking through them! Also, the font for each quote & it’s background theme is completely customizable. With new fonts & themes added on a regular basis, including holiday themes. There is even a place where you can submit quotes, whether they’re your own or by another author. Now, you do need to watch a 30 second ad before viewing quotes in a new category, but only ONCE. So all in all, I couldn’t be happier. The developers have exceeded my expectation by a mile! Now, in to the premium version. At $19.99/year, I really don’t think that’s too much to ask considering how much more you get for that price. The fonts, themes, and categories are more than triple what is available in the free version. Also instead of having to save the quotes as photos on your phone, you can create personal save files in the app. Therefore saving a ton of memory on your phone. This is the first app that I’ve actually considered paying for the subscription... mostly because of that feature. 🤣            So to sum it up... if you’re looking for a quote app, look no further.            Just an fyi... for those of you that may doubt the sincerity of this review... NO, I don’t work for the app, and I wasn’t compensated for this... I’m just your average stay-at-home mom. 🥰"

4,morecowbell74,"I really like this app... they clearly have a large library of quotes, carefully curated.  That said, a couple minor changes would make it great...  1. Add iCloud sync.  If you have versions on your iPhone and iPad, they don’t talk to each other.   2.  Bulk upload.  A few of us keep a list of our favorite quotes somewhere else... it would be nice to be able to upload these in bulk, probably by CSV.  3. Fix the feedback link... I rarely write reviews... but the “feedback” link leads to a splash page for the company, and I couldn’t easily find a way to share this feedback privately.  3.  If you’re really going for it... perhaps some kind of integration with Readwise.io. (FYI, I’m a fan, not a member of the company.)"
3,Niknak831,"I had the free version of this app and I thought that maybe if I upgraded to the pro account it would STOP repeating the same quotes but it’s doesn’t. First of all, I shouldn’t have to even pay 19.99 for quotes but I thought what the hell it’s for a year but THEN it’s a slap in the face when I continue to see the same quotes rotated on a daily basis. Once I paid and unlocked all the quotes, I shouldn’t see any quotes repeated. I’m going to cancel my subscription because this app is disappointing."
2,zaiiree,I have a android and i cant see them in the notifications
5,Harryviethung,I’ve been through some tough times emotionally and physically. This app helps me let go with peaceful vibes. Love this wholeheartedly. And this app is definitely worth the amount of fee spending 19.99 for one year ! Keep going and improving this app ! Take care !
5,hrhhhrt,Soooooooooooooooooooo. Gooooddddddd I loveeeeeeeeee itttttttttt
1,Bigyumi4567,"$19.99 a month for an app that has quotes pop up? Wow, no thanks. I’ve literally never left a bad review on an app review page, but I was quite disappointed when I was immediately greeted with a “3 week trial, then 19.99/month” pop up upon downloaded for the app and opening the screen. Honestly, I don’t mind paying for it - but this app should be in the range of a one time payment of 4.99 kind of deal. Honestly if you want widgets with motivational quotes, go save a few from Pinterest and have set them to a widget stack and to change periodically. It’s literally the same thing, but it’s FREE! :) I’m sorry to be such a hater, this app is just not worth the money whatsoever - spend your money on something worth while!"
5,Nancie55,I paid the 19.99 and it doesn’t work. The screen is plain white nothing is there
1,SierraBro,"Why the actual heck was I charged $12.99 FOR A FREE TRIAL THAT I LITERALLY JUST STARTED?! Already deleting, thank you very much"
1,qualified app rater,yo
2,BabyyGirl_Wifey💋💍💕,How are you going to give a 3 day free trial but still charge me 12.98 then 19.99 for the year??? Make it make sense !!!!!
5,EbonyJNaee,I’ve only had this app for about a week and I’ve saved so many quotes and inspiring messages to keep me from giving up on myself. It’s giving me more than i expected it to and i love it.Worth the download! You won’t regret it!
2,Jthorn4al,As soon as I downloaded it it said after three days you must pay 19.99
1,THE Tyzzler,"This is literally the FIRST ever negative review I’ve made. $19.99 was taken out of my PayPal so I checked to see what it was. Apparently says it’s for a subscription to this app? I worked Apple technical support for over a year & have NEVER fallen into the “subscription auto-renew” trap because of how over the top careful I am about it. I DID NOT sign up for this app, my Apple ID wasn’t even signed it on my phone for days prior to this being “purchased.” The app isn’t even on my phone. Money’s tight right now for everyone & this is downright despicable that I am literally broke now bc some predatory app took my last $20 for nothing."
5,nashlove8,In life what ll think is to make more money than anything. But come to think about it isn’t a bad told. just what we really need more in your life is JESUS Christ   @nash love8👂🏻
5,lmw152,The app give me such good quotes.15/10 recommend
1,Twinkle ninja,"Very disappointed with this app already. This app is not free. It costs $19.99 for a year’s subscription. But when I double clicked, it charged me double! It is the weekend, so I have to wait for my bank to open on Monday to fix this problem. So because this dollar amount is “pending” this app’s *glitch* is forcing my bank to hold my almost $40 hostage.  Not very motivational, inspiring or positive."
5,Meowdragonmilkshake,This is a 100% anxiety killer.I just downloaded the app and I already love it.Only problem is the fact that there is a pro version.😒
1,big bad S,"3 days free, then 19.99$ a year. Sorry I’m not that committed to a widget. Otherwise if you want payments it would be a super one."
4,SYD1976,"By allowing a user to actually login with a phone number or email would allow us to use it on multiple devices. Right now, expecting $19.99/device and with no ability to have the same saved favorites or collections is a rip-off...and the only thing keeping this from being a solid 5 star app."
5,pmoniquem,"Not even on amazon have I written a review and mind you I try and buy a lot of stuff. By far the most amazing thing that has gotten me through , hard times , good times , parenting when I want to rip my hair out or just encouragement and inspiration to push forward , has been this app. I have my phone always and I have it set up to send me motivation from the second I wake up to when I go to sleep 🙏🏼 #GenuinelyBlessed"
4,LotusGHealer,"Great app, but can you allow a login so that I can use the same account on multiple devices?"
1,lalapinecourt,39.99 a month? No. Get over yourselves.
5,milliew2019,I love 'Motivation' so much because it helped me so much mentally and it help me have more motivation and have more self esstem i would 100/10 recommened this app it is such a good app
5,Abdul Mugeez,I like this app cause it motivates me a lot.Especially whenever I try to give up on my problems and open this app I get more hopes and reason to live and work hard towards my dreams again. I like it and keep it up and don’t change👍👌
1,"-/:;()$@""",Downloaded only to delete after finding out its $19.99/yr. No thanks.
5,Macmelody,"I bought the subscription for the year after having gotten the free quotes for many months. I love this app. I love the motivational, daily text.  I bought the subscription on one iPad and learned my subscription would have to be bought on my iPhone and on my other iPad, so I canceled on one iPad that I hardly used and bought the subscription on another iPad that is with me throughout the day!  I did try restoring. Didn’t work. Restoring on another iPad did not work. So, without much ado, this app could have 5 stars if it carried over to my other Apple products! I do love it. But darn if I’ll pay $60.00 a year for motivational quotes for 3 units!"
4,period'8,The app is good u just have to pay for stuff.also the quotes are nice for ppl to read and feel good about them selves
1,NatureNut616,I *paid* for 2-3 motivational quotes per day and now motivation.app has decided that they are going to *push* divisive quotes from Malcolm X that justify the current rioting and looting. Shame on you!
1,LawMaltizo,Not worth 20$ a year. I can pull these “motivational quotes” out of my ass easily.
5,Wobaja,"This app is really good. It gives you lots of quotes that will lift you spirit up.You can decide what kind of quotes you want to fit your personality, which is amazing.I recommend getting this app."
5,sdh-1959,Every day I am more happier.Opened minded.
1,baileymitch,"app is ok but you can get same quotes on a lot of different FREE apps without subscribing to the app, ended subscription day of expiration still charged my card $20.00 BS 🙄"
5,Patty cucumber,This app has improved my courage!I suggest this app because it is inspiring.What I also like about it is that you can change the app icon for free!
5,Siv2020,Thanks
4,h deft jj ug you j,Helpful in the morning and throughout the day.   I await the desktop version and for Android!
4,Yoly86,"Great app with great motivational quotes in it. I think my last review got deleted. I am an app geek and download most of the decent apps that the App Store offers. This one is one of them. The only complaint I have is the premium price. Price is too high. And thinking that the lifetime price lets you access quotes you would find around the website. The only thing is that here you find them with a nice font and a neat background picture. I tried the 3-day trial and used all the features and there aren’t a lot, lot. Just changing backgrounds and font that watching an ad can give you..for free. The price for the premium lifetime is $79.99!!!! (As of now) weeks ago it was $39.99 (still too high). I think (in my opinion) that if you download the price for $19.99 (or less) you still could get lots of buyers (that I personally would recommend) that would love to buy the app for a lifetime. And you would still get millionaire. I would still use it (for free) but would love to buy it for a lifetime if the price drops."
5,Ahmed Elkhodary,Amazing inspirational app
5,cbaldwin19,I love using this app everyday to help put a quote on my social media’s. I love that you can choose different categories and change the look of the quotes font and background. I went ahead and upgraded to the premium subscription because it’s only $11.99 per year (or $2.99 per month).  It’s all around a great app!!
5,jasonscottheise,Very good qoutes
2,Adore_Mel,I set up my daily reminder for 10+ times a day and sometime it does not send me a positive notification at all. I paid $12 for the year and the app is glitching.smh😕
5,Snob640,I use this app everyday  I send this app daily to my children and close friends. They tell me it makes their day start on a great note.
4,SherryWu24,The new UI (navigation bar at the bottom of the screen) is taking too much space and ruining the visual. I enjoyed the old UI for a better use of the screen. Please change it back!
5,makyla webb,🥰🥰inlove did yrbkjnnb
5,Minx7708,This app really inspired me to move forward positively.It also helped me with anxiety.The app is great but I sometimes get annoyed how most options you have to pay.But it’s still a great app and I would rate it 10/10 Thank you!
5,Jeremy M Thomas,Great app! But come on what is the world coming too 🤣 $11.99 a year for another millennial subscription for something I can find on Pinterest? I’d buy it for $10 dollars and pay a fee for an upgrade if needed. So over have 30 app subscriptions. No more subscriptions 2020 I’m toast ✌️
5,shia yah,The tittle says it all.This helps me throughout the day.Im dealing with depression so I just switched it to depression helping and it worked!
5,Jaafar gholi,"I have very good times with this application. It’s very great, very fascinating.  In general I never leave it.Never erase this application. Thank you very very much 🙂"
5,TeeRaww2193,I downloaded the app got the free trail then I got charged the premium $38.51 for a whole year and I still got the ads and only limited to certain quotes. Then they made me pay another $3 to get the premium.
1,dab221,I wanted just the free subscription and that was it for this app but instead I was charged $39.18 that I did not authorize and did not want. I would like a refund.
5,firemedicmick,"Wow!! Not sure how you justify 35.99 dollars a year for my phone or watch to say you look great today no matter what people say. I could see $35.99 for life, not every year!!"
5,DreddyV,AMAZING
2,doodlebugward08,I love this app but I wish that you could have the themes and the quote type free.The app has great quotes and helps me get through the day but I wish it did not have to be connected to the internet to change themes without the Free trial !
1,xActaAD,"Like most apps in the App Store lately, this app is pretty useless unless you want to pay to use it. $29.99 for unlimited lifetime use? $11.99 for a year? $2.99 for a month? That’s ridiculous! Normally, I’d say forget it and just use it for free, except out of the 40 possible categories, you only get access to 8, some of which are very basic categories. The categories that most people are going to want/need are locked behind a pay wall. Don’t get me wrong I understand wanting to make money for your hard work, but this is pure greed. There is no reason for these prices, and there is no reason for pretty much everything to be locked away the way it is. Would not recommend this app to anyone."
1,Mosley2009,"Great idea and concept. However, once you have the app for a couple weeks, the same quotes are used over and over and over. So, it doesn’t really make me feel any better when I already know what it’s going to say. And the ads are getting more and more frequent. When I first downloaded, there were only a few here and there. Now, I can’t even click on the quotes without having back to back ads. Which piss me off and I’m in a worse mood than when I got the quote. A lot of work is needed"
1,Anovelista,"I originally reported this app and requested a refund because I signed up for a ONE MONTH try out at 99 cents NOT ONE YEAR AT $11.99! I disputed the original charge and it was declined. Instead of that being the end, my entire Apple account was frozen because of a ""bad charge"" even though there is plenty of money in my bank account. The ""Motivation"" app (or Apple) did not merely charge my account and move on - my account was frozen. After a few false starts and 30 minutes on a call with Apple, Apple was able to remove my payment method so I could add it again to get rid of this problem. I did NOT want this app for one year. I only wanted to try it for one month at $0.99 as (apparently falsely) advertised on the app.  I have already deleted the app off of my phone and want a full refund."
1,Ian4321,"I clicked the option for charging .99 cents per month, it’s now charging me 11.99, and not letting me download any other apps, including apple support, so I can’t even fix this issue."
5,Aquarius Experience,My 14 year old downloaded this app to my phone I am so glad she did.I am single parent of four I work a full time and have traveling agency business that I am growing.So I need all the positivity I can get .This app helps me get through ever day all day!
5,Squirell lover 123,I love this app so much!!!! It’s literally my favorite app on my whole phone!! Definitely recommend getting it. I love it and it always seems to give me the perfect Quote every day. Great app I gave a 5/5 stars but it deserves a 100/100 stars
5,i love piper reckel,Thank you for help me be Encourage and I only had for one day.and I’m already in love with it.i give lots of thank u too the person who wrote these 😁😀😃😄😁😆😊😇🙂🥰
5,Che‼️❤️,I love this app. Each day it comes to my phone with a quote that really uplifts my energy. I have referred so many to this app especially when they are going through something. The positivity is out this world! & i will continue using this app forever as long as it’s going.   Instagram @chevscache
5,so marshmollow,This is an amazing app and makes my day even better  with all the sweet quotes I do wish that you can have all the other themes of quotes but I mean you guys have to make money some how.I also love that you can save the image of the quotes to your photos it’s a smart idea.but that is all 😁❤️.
5,Ig-Susan.theboss,Ig.Susan.Theboss Great app
3,giraffebubble,"I love all the inspirational quotes.However, it does get annoying when you can’t see your favorite quotes, in fact I’ve needed the start sending my favorite quotes to myself so I don’t loose then."
3,astudentstake on life11,This app is pretty good. But to get any real motivation and get rid of adds  you need to pay 2.99 per month or 11.99 per year or 30 $ for your life. Also I don't think this app is worth that much. And  it's really hard to get motivated with having to watch adds every minute.
4,good great little thing though,I love this app so much! There are a lot of great quotes and inspiration for everyday life problems.my only complaint is that i wish that I had more access to quotes and other categories without having to go premium
2,Jinxy2,"Only 2 categories out of so many were only available, and the ads are extremely annoying. I’ll give it a couple of days before I delete the app. And also , 11.99 per category to unlock is outrageous!!!!!"
1,Jey&Tay,I’ve already paid for the app but you have to $30 to unlock the entire app. So you can chose one category.deleting this app.
5,TheSvpreme One,You can't do anything bc of the purchases.Im considering deleting the app for this reason. open up more options for the users.If 0 stars were an option I'd give it.
5,Belladonna-11,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

5,TYYYYYYYSMMMM XD,"This app is actually very good!  I really like these backgrounds,they’re really good.My favorite background is pretty much every single one! Sorry if my grammar is kinda bad but,great app!"
5,gsvsvsfss,I think that this app is very inspirational.It let’s you know that whatever ever you do in life has a purpose!!
5,Sondra's,"Sometimes I see myself in the quotes, sometimes I see someone else. When I see me I try to take what it says to heart and not just to mind, when I see someone else I send it to them with a heart ❤️ so they will know I sent it with love."

5,NaNa!❤️,This app is great it help me with my skills of praying.This show me a lot about opening up and wanna change my life around!🥰
5,Arianna hines,"Thank you, I’m growing up and I feel like nobody gets me. I feel like everyone is trying to hurt me.and this gives me hope that they they still love me that people DO care about me that GOD IS REAL so I thank you for everything ."
5,JRab681,"I absolutely love these quotes and appreciate my daily affirmations but I hate that I’m limited to just general quotes. Also, what happened to the one time fee to unlock everything? I’ll admit to pay $59.99 is a bit extreme but I think if you charge people the $35.99 to unlock everything, you would have more people purchasing at that price instead of a yearly subscription. I really would like to see a option to pay one time instead of just subscribing."
5,McMCL18,There are some great quotes! I find the one that I think is appropriate for each person each day and send it with a good morning text. I've had nothing but 'i love these everyday and look forward to them' I think one positive thing to give someone is the best gift!
4,harold5263,This is a great app! I love the widget and frequent notifications. Helps me think more positively throughout the day.   Something I noticed though is that there are quite of “meh” or “mediocre” quotes!  I remember reading one that said “go with the flow..”?? Who the freak wants to go with the flow? I want to go out there make things happen and kick some butt!
5,iShanell,Awesome thanks
5,Ms.Fashionista💋💋💄,I love this app!!It is do age appropriate and fun.Everywhere you turn they are talking about very non age appropriate things.This app is so inspiring!I definitely think you should get it 💕😍

4,xprod,Nice quotes but $60 for the full access is too much! I can download free quotes on quotesbook.com
2,rhondakgonzalez,"I understand needing to make money, but half of these quotes can be found with a nice picture on the internet. $2.99 a month or $59.99 for the lifetime subscription, no thanks!"
5,MrsKhop1,"I enjoy using this app for motivational quotes; therefore, I looked into purchasing the app for no ads! As I have done others ... this one just isn’t feasible. At. All.   I feel the app is slightly above average and am completely willing to pay a fee for the organizational efforts put into it. $60 for an app that I have already seen repeated quotes on multiple times just doesn’t sit well with me. I’d even be willing to pay $10-15 as an above average price for ANY app. I would love another pricing option that doesn’t charge minimum $59.99 for lifetime or $35.88 for one year or $5.99 a month ... but I’m sure with the substantial amount of money you’ve already made from ad and app sales this won’t happen! When looking at the App Store, any app that cost over $15.99 includes a large amount of study guides to prepare you for testing for a promotion, meaning it cost you but in the long run the app will make you money. Or there are math/accounting apps with loads of equations to help ease the balance of books and payables/receivables. Other apps have tons of creators that have created content and programs which value their apps at a higher price.   Point is no app over $10 just merely pulls free quotes/information from a free World Wide Web and then charges an astronomical fee. You are not creating content but merely copying content to a one stop convenient place. You could lower your price and probably quadruple your downloads of your paid app ... please consider it! OR maybe I don’t understand the value I’m suppose to be receiving for this price ??? Please fill me in"
5,xo._.weirdo😜🦄,So maybe it’s lame that I’m a 12 year old who has a motivation app but it’s actually really nice.You can get one everyday and sometimes right when I need one one pops up in my notifications!Its really nice to have so many quotes from so many people!😀
